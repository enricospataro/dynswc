1
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,737
So here's the most important economic fact of our time.

2
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:21,767
We are living in an age of surging income inequality,

3
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,692
particularly between those at the very top

4
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,528
and everyone else.

5
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:30,550
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,748
but it's a global phenomenon.

7
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:35,071
It's happening in communist China,

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,794
in formerly communist Russia,

9
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:40,088
it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.

10
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:43,055
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies

11
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:46,680
like Sweden, Finland and Germany.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,591
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.

13
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:53,300
In the 1970s, the One Percent

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,577
accounted for about 10 percent of the national income

15
00:00:57,577 --> 00:00:59,341
in the United States.

16
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,650
Today, their share has more than doubled

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,089
to above 20 percent.

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,189
But what's even more striking

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,875
is what's happening at the very tippy top

20
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,117
of the income distribution.

21
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:15,121
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.

22
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:18,350
today account for more than eight percent

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,240
of the national income.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,733
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.

25
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,501
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,

26
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,019
and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005

27
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,478
by Robert Reich,

28
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,217
the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

29
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:40,521
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,

30
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,241
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,

31
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,190
and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,943
of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,

33
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,785
120 million people.

34
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:56,149
Now, as it happens,

35
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,953
Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,

36
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,680
he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,982
and he has his own favorite number.

38
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:09,925
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,

39
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:12,087
the combined wealth of the people

40
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,416
on the Forbes 400 list --

41
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,813
and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --

42
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:20,585
was 300 billion dollars.

43
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:21,786
Just think about it.

44
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:23,813
You didn't even need to be a billionaire

45
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,786
to get on that list in 1992.

46
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:30,799
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled

47
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,685
to 1.7 trillion,

48
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,863
and I probably don't need to tell you

49
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:38,324
that we haven't seen anything similar happen

50
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,709
to the middle class,

51
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,410
whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.

52
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,470
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,

53
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,511
but we've been slow to notice it.

54
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,194
One of the reasons, I think,

55
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:55,172
is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.

56
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,735
Changes which are slow and gradual

57
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,275
can be hard to notice

58
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:02,179
even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.

59
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:05,411
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.

60
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,226
But I think there's something else going on.

61
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,336
Talking about income inequality,

62
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,867
even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,

63
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,008
can make us feel uncomfortable.

64
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:18,453
It feels less positive, less optimistic,

65
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:20,982
to talk about how the pie is sliced

66
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:24,034
than to think about how to make the pie bigger.

67
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,762
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,

68
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,560
talking about income distribution,

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,247
and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,

70
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,787
can be downright threatening.

71
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:40,063
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,

72
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:42,176
especially at the top.

73
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:45,764
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?

74
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:49,430
One set of causes is political:

75
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,025
lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,

76
00:03:55,025 --> 00:04:00,155
privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,

77
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,595
all of these have contributed

78
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:06,712
to more and more income going to the very, very top.

79
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:10,135
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped

80
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:13,464
under the category of "crony capitalism,"

81
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,641
political changes that benefit a group

82
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,803
of well-connected insiders

83
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:21,341
but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.

84
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,730
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism

85
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,771
is incredibly difficult.

86
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:30,264
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes

87
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,658
have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,

88
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,687
or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks

89
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:39,844
even after the most profound financial crisis

90
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,466
since the Great Depression,

91
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:46,062
or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,

92
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:50,073
including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"

93
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,847
to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that

94
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:54,955
paid by the middle class.

95
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,991
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice

96
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,987
is really, really hard,

97
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:03,455
at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.

98
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:09,104
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.

99
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,751
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues

100
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,986
that unites the left and the right.

101
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,806
A critique of crony capitalism is as central

102
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:22,103
to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.

103
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:26,441
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,

104
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:28,476
the easy part of the problem,

105
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:31,751
things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers

106
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,504
of surging income inequality.

107
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:38,243
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.

108
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:41,290
Globalization and the technology revolution,

109
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,830
the twin economic transformations

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,528
which are changing our lives

111
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:47,625
and transforming the global economy,

112
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,092
are also powering the rise of the super-rich.

113
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,672
Just think about it.

114
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,660
For the first time in history,

115
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,399
if you are an energetic entrepreneur

116
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,098
with a brilliant new idea

117
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:01,513
or a fantastic new product,

118
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:05,192
you have almost instant, almost frictionless access

119
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:09,172
to a global market of more than a billion people.

120
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:13,006
As a result, if you are very, very smart

121
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,801
and very, very lucky,

122
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,652
you can get very, very rich

123
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,182
very, very quickly.

124
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:23,024
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon

125
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:25,004
is David Karp.

126
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:27,859
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr

127
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,641
recently sold his company to Yahoo

128
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,674
for 1.1 billion dollars.

129
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,212
Think about that for a minute:

130
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:39,626
1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.

131
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:43,073
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution

132
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:46,694
and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect

133
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,637
in highly visible fields,

134
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,940
like sports and entertainment.

135
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,315
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete

136
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:58,659
or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills

137
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:02,327
across the global economy as never before.

138
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,407
But today, that superstar effect

139
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:07,389
is happening across the entire economy.

140
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,566
We have superstar technologists.

141
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,287
We have superstar bankers.

142
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,623
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.

143
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,052
There are superstar cooks

144
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,564
and superstar farmers.

145
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:20,347
There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,

146
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,338
superstar dentists,

147
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:24,442
the most dazzling exemplar of whom

148
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:27,804
is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers

149
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:30,123
to the smiles of fellow superstars

150
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,804
like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich

151
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:35,665
or European-born American fashion designer

152
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,710
Diane von Furstenberg.

153
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,793
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization

154
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,705
and the technology revolution

155
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:45,176
are creating this global plutocracy,

156
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:49,343
what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.

157
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,869
And that's because,

158
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,246
in contrast with crony capitalism,

159
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:57,156
so much of what globalization and the technology revolution

160
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:59,519
have done is highly positive.

161
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,254
Let's start with technology.

162
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:04,864
I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.

163
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,698
I love the fact that they mean that

164
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,384
whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk

165
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,431
far beyond this auditorium.

166
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm even more of a fan of globalization.

167
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,527
This is the transformation

168
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,951
which has lifted hundreds of millions

169
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:23,000
of the world's poorest people out of poverty

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,442
and into the middle class,

171
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:27,484
and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,

172
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:30,991
it's made many new products affordable --

173
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,517
who do you think built your iPhone? —

174
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:37,339
and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.

175
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,963
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.

176
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:42,499
So what's not to like?

177
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,391
Well, a few things.

178
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,495
One of the things that worries me

179
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,658
is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy

180
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:53,354
can become crony plutocracy.

181
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:56,013
Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur

182
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:59,390
who has successfully sold that idea or that product

183
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,769
to the global billions

184
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,335
and become a billionaire in the process.

185
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,704
It gets tempting at that point

186
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:08,679
to use your economic nous

187
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,951
to manipulate the rules of the global political economy

188
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:15,037
in your own favor.

189
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,786
And that's no mere hypothetical example.

190
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:22,215
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.

191
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:24,319
These are among the world's most admired,

192
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,865
most beloved, most innovative companies.

193
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,789
They also happen to be particularly adept

194
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:32,027
at working the international tax system

195
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:36,585
so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.

196
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:40,900
And why stop at just playing the global political

197
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,988
and economic system as it exists

198
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:45,133
to your own maximum advantage?

199
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:49,450
Once you have the tremendous economic power

200
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,523
that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution

201
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:55,773
and the political power that inevitably entails,

202
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,286
it becomes tempting as well

203
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:01,874
to start trying to change the rules of the game

204
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,976
in your own favor.

205
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,710
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.

206
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,645
It's what the Russian oligarchs did

207
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:11,907
in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization

208
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:13,877
of Russia's natural resources.

209
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:15,651
It's one way of describing what happened

210
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:17,686
with deregulation of the financial services

211
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,921
in the U.S. and the U.K.

212
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,847
A second thing that worries me

213
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,578
is how easily meritocratic plutocracy

214
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:27,324
can become aristocracy.

215
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,399
One way of describing the plutocrats

216
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,206
is as alpha geeks,

217
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,720
and they are people who are acutely aware

218
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,128
of how important highly sophisticated

219
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:40,310
analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.

220
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,729
That's why they are spending

221
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,506
unprecedented time and resources

222
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,403
educating their own children.

223
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,670
The middle class is spending more on schooling too,

224
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,031
but in the global educational arms race

225
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,815
that starts at nursery school

226
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:58,553
and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,

227
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:02,031
the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned

228
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,570
by the One Percent.

229
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,276
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger

230
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,981
and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.

231
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:12,784
As income inequality increases,

232
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,557
social mobility decreases.

233
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:18,315
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,

234
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,531
but increasingly you have to be born

235
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:25,415
on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.

236
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:28,439
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,

237
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:32,790
is the extent to which those same largely positive forces

238
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,980
which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy

239
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,412
also happen to be hollowing out the middle class

240
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,366
in Western industrialized economies.

241
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,453
Let's start with technology.

242
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,526
Those same forces that are creating billionaires

243
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:51,549
are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.

244
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,488
When's the last time you used a travel agent?

245
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:57,569
And in contrast with the industrial revolution,

246
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,725
the titans of our new economy

247
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,527
aren't creating that many new jobs.

248
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:06,346
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,

249
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:09,369
Facebook fewer than 10,000.

250
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:12,039
The same is true of globalization.

251
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,282
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people

252
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,622
out of poverty in the emerging markets,

253
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:20,488
it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs

254
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,789
from the developed Western economies.

255
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,556
The terrifying reality is

256
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,813
that there is no economic rule

257
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,750
which automatically translates

258
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,453
increased economic growth

259
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,763
into widely shared prosperity.

260
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:37,437
That's shown in what I consider to be

261
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:41,120
the most scary economic statistic of our time.

262
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,178
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity

263
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,840
have been decoupled from increases

264
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:49,790
in wages and employment.

265
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,734
That means that our countries are getting richer,

266
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:55,358
our companies are getting more efficient,

267
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,299
but we're not creating more jobs

268
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,170
and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.

269
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,379
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this

270
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,090
is to worry about structural unemployment.

271
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,877
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.

272
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:15,469
After all, in a totally free labor market,

273
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:18,671
we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.

274
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,699
The dystopia that worries me

275
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,345
is a universe in which a few geniuses

276
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,425
invent Google and its ilk

277
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:31,620
and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.

278
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,253
So when I get really depressed about all of this,

279
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:38,082
I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.

280
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:41,977
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,

281
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,477
it worked out pretty well, didn't it?

282
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:51,500
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --

283
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,526
well, there are a few exceptions —

284
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:58,517
and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.

285
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,101
But it's important to remember

286
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,923
that before we learned how to share the fruits

287
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,602
of the Industrial Revolution

288
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:08,165
with the broad swathes of society,

289
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:11,560
we had to go through two depressions,

290
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,419
the Great Depression of the 1930s,

291
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,273
the Long Depression of the 1870s,

292
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,440
two world wars, communist revolutions

293
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
in Russia and in China,

294
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,844
and an era of tremendous social

295
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,600
and political upheaval in the West.

296
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,320
We also, not coincidentally,

297
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,858
went through an era of tremendous

298
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,437
social and political inventions.

299
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,781
We created the modern welfare state.

300
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,523
We created public education.

301
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,227
We created public health care.

302
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,002
We created public pensions.

303
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:44,027
We created unions.

304
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:46,543
Today, we are living through an era

305
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,504
of economic transformation

306
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,810
comparable in its scale and its scope

307
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,078
to the Industrial Revolution.

308
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,269
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all

309
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,387
and not just the plutocrats,

310
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:01,051
we need to embark on an era

311
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:04,970
of comparably ambitious social and political change.

312
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,628
We need a new New Deal.

313
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,628
(Applause)
