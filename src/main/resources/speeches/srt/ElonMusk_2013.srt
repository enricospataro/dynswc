1
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:15,306
Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,462
would persuade you to think of trying

3
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,820
to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,222
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.

5
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,374
I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely

6
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:29,446
to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,938
I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport

8
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:35,297
and sustainable energy production.

9
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:37,342
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem

10
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:39,841
is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,

11
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,046
independent of environmental concerns.

12
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:44,963
In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,

13
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:48,043
given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,

14
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:52,098
we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

15
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:56,108
CA: Most of American electricity comes from

16
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,770
burning fossil fuels.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,385
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?

18
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,344
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.

19
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:08,304
One is that, even if you take the same source fuel

20
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,293
and produce power at the power plant

21
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:13,187
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.

22
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:15,166
So if you take, say, natural gas,

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,774
which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,

24
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:20,772
if you burn that in a modern

25
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,967
General Electric natural gas turbine,

26
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,805
you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.

27
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:27,516
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,

28
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,416
you get about 20 percent efficiency.

29
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,996
And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,

30
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,364
you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,

31
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,079
is voluminous,

32
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,533
and you can take the waste heat

33
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,902
and run a steam turbine and generate

34
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,686
a secondary power source.

35
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:43,472
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,

36
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,876
even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off

37
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,348
charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

38
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:51,459
CA: That scale delivers efficiency.

39
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,198
EM: Yes, it does.

40
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:56,216
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means

41
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,619
of power generation anyway, electricity generation.

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,688
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,

43
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,153
then it makes sense for us to have electric cars

44
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,728
as the mode of transport.

45
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,163
CA: So we've got some video here

46
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,654
of the Tesla being assembled,

47
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:14,368
which, if we could play that first video --

48
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:19,312
So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?

49
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:22,888
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,

50
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:24,958
and I should say that I think, actually,

51
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,416
all modes of transport will become fully electric

52
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:32,483
with the ironic exception of rockets.

53
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,240
There's just no way around Newton's third law.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,692
The question is how do you accelerate

55
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,272
the advent of electric transport?

56
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:42,720
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,047
a really energy efficient car,

58
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,904
so that means making it incredibly light,

59
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:47,930
and so what you're seeing here

60
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,676
is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car

61
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,262
made in North America.

62
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:54,950
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques

63
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,567
to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

64
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,727
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient

65
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,095
of any car of its size.

66
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:05,760
So as a result, the energy usage is very low,

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,976
and it has the most advanced battery pack,

68
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,560
and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,499
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

70
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:17,088
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,

71
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:20,359
but you think the math can still work out intelligently --

72
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,495
by combining light body, heavy battery,

73
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,768
you can still gain spectacular efficiency.

74
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,600
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,361
to offset the mass of the pack,

76
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,390
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.

77
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,115
And in fact, customers of the Model S

78
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,194
are sort of competing with each other

79
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:39,213
to try to get the highest possible range.

80
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:42,743
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.

81
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:45,831
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,

82
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:48,421
broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.

83
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,033
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that

84
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,847
to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed

85
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:56,759
and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)

86
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,649
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --

87
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:03,287
if you drive it 65 miles an hour,

88
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,251
under normal conditions,

89
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:07,135
250 miles is a reasonable number.

90
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,273
CA: Let's show that second video

91
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:11,119
showing the Tesla in action on ice.

92
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,787
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.

93
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,202
What is the most surprising thing about the experience

94
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,710
of driving the car?

95
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,188
EM: In creating an electric car,

96
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,586
the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.

97
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:24,273
So we wanted really to have people feel as though

98
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,376
they've almost got to mind meld with the car,

99
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:29,550
so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,

100
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,596
and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,

101
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,430
like the car has ESP.

102
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,926
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.

103
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:40,053
You can't do that with a gasoline car.

104
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,035
I think that's really a profound difference,

105
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,822
and people only experience that when they have a test drive.

106
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:49,116
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.

107
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:52,691
Is there a road map where this becomes

108
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,270
a mass-market vehicle?

109
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,830
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been

110
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,102
to have a sort of three-step process,

111
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,868
where version one was an expensive car at low volume,

112
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,933
version two is medium priced and medium volume,

113
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,222
and then version three would be low price, high volume.

114
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:09,905
So we're at step two at this point.

115
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:12,855
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.

116
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,854
Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.

117
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,958
And our third generation car, which should hopefully

118
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,687
be out in about three or four years

119
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,342
will be a $30,000 car.

120
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:24,824
But whenever you've got really new technology,

121
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,918
it generally takes about three major versions

122
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,138
in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.

123
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,862
And so I think we're making progress in that direction,

124
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:35,134
and I feel confident that we'll get there.

125
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,043
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,

126
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:40,791
you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.

127
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:45,038
There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.

128
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,878
Do you see that coming, really, truly,

129
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:50,131
or just on a few key routes?

130
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:53,006
EM: There actually are far more charging stations

131
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,231
than people realize,

132
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,590
and at Tesla we developed something

133
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,798
called a Supercharging technology,

134
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:03,110
and we're offering that if you buy a Model S

135
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,575
for free, forever.

136
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,230
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.

137
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,060
We actually have California and Nevada covered,

138
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,334
and we've got the Eastern seaboard

139
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,586
from Boston to D.C. covered.

140
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:15,968
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive

141
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,111
from L.A. to New York

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,713
just using the Supercharger network,

143
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,930
which charges at five times the rate of anything else.

144
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,356
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,

145
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,355
to stop time, of about six or seven.

146
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,585
So if you drive for three hours,

147
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,223
you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,

148
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,720
because that's normally what people will stop for.

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,840
So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,

150
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,378
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,

151
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,117
hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.

152
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,474
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.

153
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,450
So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.

154
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,417
Wait for an hour, but the good news is,

155
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,856
you're helping save the planet,

156
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,549
and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.

157
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,413
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people

158
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:02,938
to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.

159
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:10,666
It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles

160
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,764
and then stop for half an hour

161
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,129
and then keep going.

162
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,411
That's the natural cadence of a trip.

163
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:21,792
CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.

164
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,434
You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.

165
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,946
What's unusual about that?

166
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,306
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,

167
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,946
we have to have sustainable electricity production

168
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:34,594
as well as consumption,

169
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:38,416
so I'm quite confident that the primary means

170
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,897
of power generation will be solar.

171
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:43,232
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.

172
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:46,466
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,

173
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,358
and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy

174
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:52,234
for purposes of human civilization.

175
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,240
What most people know but don't realize they know

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,594
is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.

177
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:00,834
If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball

178
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,996
at three degrees Kelvin,

179
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:06,794
and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.

180
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,450
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.

181
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,801
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,

182
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,065
effectively, thousands of years of sun power

183
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:16,130
compressed into a small space,

184
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,109
so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,

185
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:22,198
and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,

186
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:25,642
fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?

187
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,951
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar

188
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:32,867
will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.

189
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,254
(Applause)CA: How?

190
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:38,827
EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.

191
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:41,861
CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.

192
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,012
What are you doing?

193
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:46,260
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system

194
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,802
or you can lease a solar system.

195
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,792
Most people choose to lease.

196
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,858
And the thing about solar power is that

197
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,609
it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,

198
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,834
so once it's installed, it's just there.

199
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:02,335
It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.

200
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:05,273
So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost

201
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,248
of that initial installation low,

202
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,883
and then get the cost of the financing low,

203
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,507
because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.

204
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:16,923
And we've made huge progress in that direction,

205
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,491
and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.

206
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,268
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,

207
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:25,484
don't pay so much up front.

208
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:28,164
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.

209
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,803
We will install panels on your roof.

210
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,404
You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?

211
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:37,648
EM: Typical leases are 20 years,

212
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:42,311
but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.

213
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:46,461
It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.

214
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,341
Pretty good deal.

215
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,254
CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.

216
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,709
No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.

217
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,104
For you, the dream here then is that --

218
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:59,879
I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?

219
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,061
I mean, how do you, the company, benefit?

220
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,603
EM: Well, essentially,

221
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:12,490
SolarCity raises a chunk of capital

222
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,160
from say, a company or a bank.

223
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,373
Google is one of our big partners here.

224
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:20,797
And they have an expected return on that capital.

225
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:25,183
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof

226
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:28,629
and then charges the homeowner or business owner

227
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,339
a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.

228
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,852
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.

229
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,616
You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.

230
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,291
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to

231
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,632
is a giant distributed utility.

232
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:47,515
I think it's a good thing, because utilities

233
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:50,352
have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.

234
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,447
So effectively it's the first time

235
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,712
there's been competition for this monopoly,

236
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:58,712
because the utilities have been the only ones

237
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:01,359
that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.

238
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,250
So I think it's actually very empowering

239
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,887
for homeowners and businesses.

240
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,245
CA: And you really picture a future

241
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:11,164
where a majority of power in America,

242
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:15,866
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?

243
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:21,664
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,

244
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,776
and most likely a majority,

245
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:29,036
and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.

246
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,504
I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?

247
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:34,250
EM: More from solar than any other source.

248
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,008
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?

249
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:41,408
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.

250
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:45,728
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)

251
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,520
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,

252
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,323
so in roughly 18 years,

253
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:53,880
I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.

254
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,649
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made

255
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,865
with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.

256
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:02,642
You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.

257
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:05,078
You decided to build a space company.

258
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:07,151
Why on Earth would someone do that?

259
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,331
(Laughter)

260
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:12,144
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.

261
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,403
People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy

262
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:17,304
who made a small fortune in the space industry?"

263
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,552
Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.

264
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,098
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out

265
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:26,385
the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.

266
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,426
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"

267
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:34,488
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?

268
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,670
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.

269
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,420
We came very close to failure,

270
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,554
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.

271
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:48,704
The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,

272
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,658
and in particular to try to crack a problem

273
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,242
that I think is vital

274
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,269
for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,

275
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,153
which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

276
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,244
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?

277
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:06,258
So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?

278
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:09,637
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?

279
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,773
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,

280
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,169
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.

281
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,154
It was really more from the standpoint of

282
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:19,024
what are the things that need to happen in order for

283
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,844
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?

284
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:25,933
And I really think there's a fundamental difference,

285
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,329
if you sort of look into the future,

286
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,786
between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,

287
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,901
that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,

288
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,113
and I think that's really exciting,

289
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,284
compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth

290
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,572
until some eventual extinction event.

291
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,324
CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building

292
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:46,668
a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.

293
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:48,947
How on Earth have you done that?

294
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:52,058
NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?

295
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:54,459
EM: Well, we've made significant advances

296
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,222
in the technology of the airframe, the engines,

297
00:13:57,222 --> 00:14:00,443
the electronics and the launch operation.

298
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:03,164
There's a long list of innovations

299
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:05,332
that we've come up with there

300
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:11,007
that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --

301
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:14,420
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?

302
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,035
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.

303
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,275
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's

304
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,023
more dangerous to patent than not to patent.

305
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:24,719
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,

306
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:29,188
the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)

307
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,607
CA: That's really, really interesting.

308
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:35,236
But the big innovation is still ahead,

309
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,975
and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.

310
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,664
EM: Right, so the big innovation—

311
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:43,901
CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.

312
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:47,975
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that

313
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,517
they're all expendable.

314
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,779
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.

315
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,913
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,

316
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:56,839
but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,

317
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,935
and the parts that were reusable

318
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:03,991
took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.

319
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:07,577
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

320
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,759
Obviously that doesn't work very well for —

321
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,979
CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?

322
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:17,310
EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages

323
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,675
be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site

324
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:23,692
and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.

325
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:28,375
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)

326
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,583
And so what a lot of people don't realize is,

327
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,181
the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.

328
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,885
It's much like on a jet.

329
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,401
So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent

330
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,303
of the cost of the rocket.

331
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:43,455
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,

332
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:46,295
roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight

333
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:49,375
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.

334
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,815
That's why it's so important.

335
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,037
Every mode of transport that we use,

336
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,967
whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,

337
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,303
is reusable, but not rockets.

338
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:01,591
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

339
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,058
CA: You asked me the question earlier

340
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,853
of how popular traveling on cruises would be

341
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:12,988
if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.

342
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,183
CA: Definitely more expensive.

343
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:19,154
So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,

344
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:23,327
and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,

345
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:27,124
at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.

346
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,406
You'd like to see a colony on Mars.

347
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,958
EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination

348
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,991
of companies and governments, needs to make progress

349
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:38,950
in the direction of making life multi-planetary,

350
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,582
of establishing a base on another planet,

351
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,927
on Mars -- being the only realistic option --

352
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,309
and then building that base up

353
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,258
until we're a true multi-planet species.

354
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,231
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"

355
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:56,050
how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.

356
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,155
How's it going?

357
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:00,319
EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently

358
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,903
with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,

359
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:07,079
where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,

360
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,828
the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.

361
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,864
And we've had some good tests.

362
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,925
CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.

363
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,568
So that's just to give a sense of scale.

364
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,008
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash

365
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:21,863
and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)

366
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:23,815
CA: All right, let's see that video then,

367
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,846
because this is actually amazing when you think about it.

368
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:31,553
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then --

369
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,471
EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size

370
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:36,097
of a 12-story building.

371
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:42,067
(Rocket launch)

372
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:50,891
So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,

373
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,767
and it's constantly adjusting

374
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,728
the angle, the pitch 
and yaw of the main engine,

375
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:59,359
and maintaining roll 
with cold gas thrusters.

376
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:12,179
CA: How cool is that? (Applause)

377
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,853
Elon, how have you done this?

378
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:22,167
These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,

379
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,845
Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,

380
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:27,430
they're such ambitious projects at scale.

381
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,894
How on Earth has one person

382
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:32,369
been able to innovate in this way?

383
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,206
What is it about you?

384
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:39,602
EM: I don't know, actually.

385
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,842
I don't have a good answer for you.

386
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:45,477
I work a lot. I mean, a lot.

387
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,790
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.

388
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,354
CA: My theory is that you

389
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:55,510
have an ability to think at a system level of design

390
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,153
that pulls together design, technology and business,

391
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:02,629
so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,

392
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:05,126
into one package,

393
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,485
synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --

394
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:11,579
and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident

395
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,195
in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.

396
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:21,074
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.

397
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,171
I mean, almost no one can do that.

398
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:26,443
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?

399
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:29,867
Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?

400
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,606
It is truly amazing what you've done.

401
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,615
EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.

402
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:38,425
Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.

403
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:41,049
It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.

404
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,787
Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,

405
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:49,178
boil things down to their fundamental truths

406
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,569
and reason up from there,

407
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,155
as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

408
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,369
Through most of our life, we get through life

409
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,457
by reasoning by analogy,

410
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,995
which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.

411
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,475
And you have to do that.

412
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:06,049
Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.

413
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,193
But when you want to do something new,

414
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:11,925
you have to apply the physics approach.

415
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:14,173
Physics is really figuring out how to discover

416
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,818
new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.

417
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,721
It's really counterintuitive.

418
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:21,242
So I think that's an important thing to do,

419
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:25,800
and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,

420
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,921
and solicit it, particularly from friends.

421
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:31,387
This may sound like simple advice,

422
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,809
but hardly anyone does that,

423
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,161
and it's incredibly helpful.

424
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:39,523
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.

425
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,807
Learn from this man.

426
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,297
Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.

427
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:47,707
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.

428
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,968
Look at that. (Applause)

429
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:54,795
Just take a bow. That was fantastic.

430
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,256
Thank you so much.
