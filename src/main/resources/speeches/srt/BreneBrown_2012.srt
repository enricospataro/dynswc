1
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:17,097
I'm going to tell you a little bit
about my TEDxHouston Talk.

2
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:20,034
I woke up the morning
after I gave that talk

3
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:25,382
with the worst vulnerability
hangover of my life.

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,261
And I actually didn't leave my house
for about three days.

5
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:35,139
The first time I left
was to meet a friend for lunch.

6
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:38,029
And when I walked in,
she was already at the table.

7
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,546
I sat down, and she said,
"God, you look like hell."

8
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:44,336
I said, "Thanks. I feel really --

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,948
I'm not functioning."

10
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:48,146
And she said, "What's going on?"

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,763
And I said, "I just told 500 people

12
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,796
that I became a researcher
to avoid vulnerability.

13
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:01,862
And that when being vulnerable
emerged from my data,

14
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:06,465
as absolutely essential
to whole-hearted living,

15
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,796
I told these 500 people
that I had a breakdown.

16
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,298
I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,796
At what point did I think
that was a good idea?"

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,941
(Laughter)

19
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,123
And she said, "I saw
your talk live-streamed.

20
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,439
It was not really you.

21
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,845
It was a little different
than what you usually do.

22
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:25,912
But it was great."

23
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,197
And I said,

24
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,796
"This can't happen.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,561
YouTube, they're putting
this thing on YouTube.

26
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:36,193
And we're going to be talking
about 600, 700 people."

27
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:40,542
(Laughter)

28
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,693
And she said,
"Well, I think it's too late."

29
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,997
And I said, "Let me ask you something."

30
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,473
And she said, "Yeah."

31
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:49,790
I said, "Do you remember
when we were in college,

32
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:51,855
really wild and kind of dumb?"

33
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,885
She said, "Yeah."

34
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,535
I said, "Remember when
we'd leave a really bad message

35
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,535
on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?

36
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:01,565
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
and then erase the tape?"

37
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,986
(Laughter)

38
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,716
And she goes, "Uh... no."

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,950
(Laughter)

40
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,600
Of course, the only thing
I could say at that point was,

41
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,008
"Yeah, me neither.

42
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:16,645
Yeah -- me neither."

43
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,986
And I'm thinking to myself,

44
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:21,796
"Brené, what are you doing?

45
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,045
Why did you bring this up?

46
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,670
Have you lost your mind?

47
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,979
Your sisters would be perfect for this."

48
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,408
(Laughter)

49
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,562
So I looked back up and she said,

50
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:37,340
"Are you really going to try
to break in and steal the video

51
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:38,940
before they put it on YouTube?"

52
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,452
(Laughter)

53
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:43,436
And I said, "I'm just thinking
about it a little bit."

54
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,222
(Laughter)

55
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:49,799
She said, "You're like the worst
vulnerability role model ever."

56
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:51,796
(Laughter)

57
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,725
Then I looked at her and I said something

58
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,677
that at the time felt a little dramatic,

59
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,113
but ended up being
more prophetic than dramatic.

60
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,558
"If 500 turns into 1,000

61
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:06,042
or 2,000,

62
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,796
my life is over."

63
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,652
(Laughter)

64
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,137
I had no contingency plan
for four million.

65
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,820
(Laughter)

66
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:20,091
And my life did end when that happened.

67
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:23,796
And maybe the hardest part
about my life ending

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,767
is that I learned something
hard about myself,

69
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,235
and that was that,

70
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,796
as much as I would be frustrated

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,344
about not being able to get
my work out to the world,

72
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,796
there was a part of me
that was working very hard

73
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,356
to engineer staying small,

74
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,206
staying right under the radar.

75
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,714
But I want to talk
about what I've learned.

76
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,541
There's two things
that I've learned in the last year.

77
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,285
The first is:

78
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:57,567
vulnerability is not weakness.

79
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,301
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.

80
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,825
Let me ask you honestly --

81
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,657
and I'll give you this warning,

82
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,967
I'm trained as a therapist,

83
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,796
so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --

84
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,265
so if you could just raise your hand
that would be awesome --

85
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,796
how many of you honestly,

86
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,654
when you're thinking about doing
or saying something vulnerable

87
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,107
think, "God, vulnerability is weakness."

88
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:26,179
How many of you think of vulnerability
and weakness synonymously?

89
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,401
The majority of people.

90
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,571
Now let me ask you this question:

91
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:33,170
This past week at TED,

92
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,796
how many of you,
when you saw vulnerability up here,

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,528
thought it was pure courage?

94
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:42,448
Vulnerability is not weakness.

95
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,030
I define vulnerability as emotional risk,

96
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,332
exposure, uncertainty.

97
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:53,062
It fuels our daily lives.

98
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,979
And I've come to the belief --

99
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,248
this is my 12th year
doing this research --

100
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:03,774
that vulnerability is our most accurate
measurement of courage --

101
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,257
to be vulnerable,
to let ourselves be seen,

102
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,352
to be honest.

103
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:14,138
One of the weird things that's happened
is, after the TED explosion,

104
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:17,795
I got a lot of offers to speak
all over the country --

105
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,181
everyone from schools and parent meetings

106
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,157
to Fortune 500 companies.

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,237
And so many of the calls went like this,

108
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,011
"Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk.

109
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,896
We'd like you to come in and speak.

110
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,796
We'd appreciate it

111
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,152
if you wouldn't mention
vulnerability or shame."

112
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:37,790
(Laughter)

113
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,663
What would you like for me to talk about?

114
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,313
There's three big answers.

115
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,463
This is mostly, to be honest with you,
from the business sector:

116
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:49,865
innovation, creativity and change.

117
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,310
(Laughter)

118
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:56,254
So let me go on the record and say,

119
00:05:56,278 --> 00:06:01,448
vulnerability is the birthplace
of innovation, creativity and change.

120
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:07,011
(Applause)

121
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:13,865
To create is to make something
that has never existed before.

122
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,796
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.

123
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,796
Adaptability to change
is all about vulnerability.

124
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:24,375
The second thing,

125
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,205
in addition to really
finally understanding

126
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,632
the relationship between
vulnerability and courage,

127
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,521
the second thing I learned, is this:

128
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,820
We have to talk about shame.

129
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,613
And I'm going to be
really honest with you.

130
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:44,161
When I became a "vulnerability researcher"

131
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,920
and that became the focus
because of the TED talk --

132
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,341
and I'm not kidding.

133
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,928
I'll give you an example.

134
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,865
About three months ago,
I was in a sporting goods store

135
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,318
buying goggles and shin guards

136
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,917
and all the things that parents buy
at the sporting goods store.

137
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,790
About from a hundred feet away,
this is what I hear:

138
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,445
"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"

139
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,325
(Laughter)

140
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:11,366
(Laughter ends)

141
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,465
I'm a fifth-generation Texan.

142
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:17,044
Our family motto is "Lock and load."

143
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,703
I am not a natural
vulnerability researcher.

144
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,796
So I'm like,

145
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,774
just keep walking, she's on my six.

146
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,218
(Laughter)

147
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:31,377
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"

148
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,051
I turn around, I go, "Hi."

149
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,705
She's right here and she said,

150
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,515
"You're the shame researcher
who had the breakdown."

151
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,353
(Laughter)

152
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:49,099
At this point, parents are, like,
pulling their children close.

153
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:50,223
(Laughter)

154
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,591
"Look away."

155
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,788
And I'm so worn out
at this point in my life,

156
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,523
I look at her and I actually say,

157
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:01,181
"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."

158
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,796
(Laughter)

159
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,141
(Applause)

160
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,022
And she looks back and does this,

161
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,070
"I know."

162
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,095
(Laughter)

163
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,910
And she said,

164
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,285
"We watched your TED talk in my book club.

165
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,285
Then we read your book
and we renamed ourselves

166
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,286
'The Breakdown Babes.'"

167
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,549
(Laughter)

168
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,585
And she said, "Our tagline is:

169
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:26,796
'We're falling apart
and it feels fantastic.'"

170
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,649
(Laughter)

171
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:34,086
You can only imagine what it's like
for me in a faculty meeting.

172
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:35,745
(Sighs)

173
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:40,155
So when I became Vulnerability TED,

174
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,528
like an action figure --

175
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:46,734
Like Ninja Barbie,
but I'm Vulnerability TED --

176
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,437
I thought, I'm going to leave
that shame stuff behind,

177
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,405
because I spent six years studying shame

178
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,270
before I started writing
and talking about vulnerability.

179
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:58,362
And I thought, thank God,
because shame is this horrible topic,

180
00:08:58,386 --> 00:08:59,952
no one wants to talk about it.

181
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:02,454
It's the best way to shut
people down on an airplane.

182
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:04,417
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."

183
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,664
(Laughter)

184
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,796
And I see you.

185
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,796
(Laughter)

186
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:18,074
But in surviving this last year,

187
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,749
I was reminded of a cardinal rule --

188
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,796
not a research rule,

189
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,045
but a moral imperative
from my upbringing --

190
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:30,244
"you've got to dance
with the one who brung ya".

191
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,623
And I did not learn about vulnerability

192
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,714
and courage and creativity and innovation

193
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,540
from studying vulnerability.

194
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:42,326
I learned about these things
from studying shame.

195
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:46,513
And so I want to walk you in to shame.

196
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,795
Jungian analysts call shame
the swampland of the soul.

197
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,896
And we're going to walk in.

198
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,796
And the purpose is not to walk in

199
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,126
and construct a home and live there.

200
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:03,644
It is to put on some galoshes --

201
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,247
and walk through and find our way around.

202
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,001
Here's why.

203
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:17,413
We heard the most compelling call ever
to have a conversation in this country,

204
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:20,049
and I think globally, around race, right?

205
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,492
Yes? We heard that.

206
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,516
Yes?

207
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,587
Cannot have that conversation
without shame.

208
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:32,077
Because you cannot talk about race
without talking about privilege.

209
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:34,244
And when people start
talking about privilege,

210
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:35,667
they get paralyzed by shame.

211
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:40,782
We heard a brilliant simple solution
to not killing people in surgery,

212
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,100
which is, have a checklist.

213
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,802
You can't fix that problem
without addressing shame,

214
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,796
because when they teach
those folks how to suture,

215
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,176
they also teach them
how to stitch their self-worth

216
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,573
to being all-powerful.

217
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:57,009
And all-powerful folks
don't need checklists.

218
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,778
And I had to write down
the name of this TED Fellow

219
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,325
so I didn't mess it up here.

220
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,841
Myshkin Ingawale,

221
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,603
I hope I did right by you.

222
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:10,715
(Applause)

223
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,671
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.

224
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:16,061
And he got up and he explained
how he was driven to create

225
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,259
some technology to help test for anemia,

226
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,506
because people were dying unnecessarily.

227
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:22,725
And he said, "I saw this need.

228
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,416
So you know what I did? I made it."

229
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,995
And everybody just burst into applause,
and they were like "Yes!"

230
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,714
And he said, "And it didn't work.

231
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:30,867
(Laughter)

232
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,622
And then I made it 32 more times,

233
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:35,796
and then it worked."

234
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,829
You know what the big secret about TED is?

235
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,426
I can't wait to tell people this.

236
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,144
I guess I'm doing it right now.

237
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,272
(Laughter)

238
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,319
This is like the failure conference.

239
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:47,597
(Laughter)

240
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:48,766
No, it is.

241
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,549
(Applause)

242
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,399
You know why this place is amazing?

243
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,542
Because very few people here
are afraid to fail.

244
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,723
And no one who gets on the stage,
so far that I've seen, has not failed.

245
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:05,564
I've failed miserably, many times.

246
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,175
I don't think the world understands that,

247
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,641
because of shame.

248
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,897
There's a great quote
that saved me this past year

249
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,314
by Theodore Roosevelt.

250
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:17,400
A lot of people refer to it
as the "Man in the Arena" quote.

251
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:19,796
And it goes like this:

252
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,877
"It is not the critic who counts.

253
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,226
It is not the man who sits and points out

254
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,729
how the doer of deeds
could have done things better

255
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:29,744
and how he falls and stumbles.

256
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,835
The credit goes to the man in the arena

257
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:37,050
whose face is marred
with dust and blood and sweat.

258
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,096
But when he's in the arena,

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,286
at best, he wins,

260
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,170
and at worst, he loses,

261
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,439
but when he fails, when he loses,

262
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:49,193
he does so daring greatly."

263
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,669
And that's what this conference,
to me, is about.

264
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:57,256
Life is about daring greatly,
about being in the arena.

265
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,329
When you walk up to that arena
and you put your hand on the door,

266
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,004
and you think, "I'm going in
and I'm going to try this,"

267
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,403
shame is the gremlin

268
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,649
who says, "Uh, uh.

269
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:07,921
You're not good enough.

270
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:11,292
You never finished that MBA.
Your wife left you.

271
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,816
I know your dad really
wasn't in Luxembourg,

272
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,146
he was in Sing Sing.

273
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,914
I know those things
that happened to you growing up.

274
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,267
I know you don't think

275
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,148
that you're pretty, smart,
talented or powerful enough.

276
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,577
I know your dad never paid attention,
even when you made CFO."

277
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,093
Shame is that thing.

278
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:35,657
And if we can quiet it down and walk in

279
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,491
and say, "I'm going to do this,"

280
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,796
we look up and the critic
that we see pointing and laughing,

281
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,170
99 percent of the time is who?

282
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,514
Us.

283
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,796
Shame drives two big tapes --

284
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,063
"never good enough" --

285
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,769
and, if you can talk it out of that one,

286
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,495
"who do you think you are?"

287
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,943
The thing to understand
about shame is, it's not guilt.

288
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,778
Shame is a focus on self,
guilt is a focus on behavior.

289
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,483
Shame is "I am bad."

290
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:08,299
Guilt is "I did something bad."

291
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,796
How many of you,

292
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,055
if you did something
that was hurtful to me,

293
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,920
would be willing to say,
"I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"

294
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,040
How many of you would be
willing to say that?

295
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,796
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

296
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,366
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.

297
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,770
There's a huge difference
between shame and guilt.

298
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,366
And here's what you need to know.

299
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,230
Shame is highly, highly correlated

300
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:35,481
with addiction, depression,
violence, aggression,

301
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:38,155
bullying, suicide, eating disorders.

302
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,400
And here's what you even
need to know more.

303
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,666
Guilt, inversely correlated
with those things.

304
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:49,879
The ability to hold something
we've done or failed to do

305
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:53,291
up against who we want to be
is incredibly adaptive.

306
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,681
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.

307
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,367
The other thing you need
to know about shame

308
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:04,010
is it's absolutely organized by gender.

309
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,856
If shame washes over me
and washes over Chris,

310
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,468
it's going to feel the same.

311
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,796
Everyone sitting in here knows
the warm wash of shame.

312
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:16,421
We're pretty sure that the only people
who don't experience shame

313
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,263
are people who have no capacity
for connection or empathy.

314
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:21,850
Which means, yes, I have a little shame;

315
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,366
no, I'm a sociopath.

316
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,820
So I would opt for, yes,
you have a little shame.

317
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,409
Shame feels the same for men and women,

318
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:32,894
but it's organized by gender.

319
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,996
For women,

320
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,325
the best example I can give you
is Enjoli, the commercial.

321
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,016
"I can put the wash on the line,
pack the lunches, hand out the kisses

322
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,119
and be at work at five to nine.

323
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:50,169
I can bring home the bacon,
fry it up in the pan

324
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:52,118
and never let you forget you're a man."

325
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,791
For women, shame is, do it all,

326
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:56,907
do it perfectly

327
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:58,862
and never let them see you sweat.

328
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,796
I don't know how much perfume
that commercial sold,

329
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,476
but I guarantee you,

330
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,487
it moved a lot of antidepressants
and anti-anxiety meds.

331
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:10,675
(Laughter)

332
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:14,172
Shame, for women, is this web

333
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:18,064
of unobtainable, conflicting,
competing expectations

334
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:19,732
about who we're supposed to be.

335
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:22,891
And it's a straight-jacket.

336
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:24,796
For men,

337
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,245
shame is not a bunch of competing,
conflicting expectations.

338
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,954
Shame is one,

339
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,591
do not be perceived as what?

340
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,065
Weak.

341
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:38,238
I did not interview men
for the first four years of my study.

342
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,520
It wasn't until a man looked at me
after a book signing, and said,

343
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:43,072
"I love what say about shame,

344
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,049
I'm curious why you didn't mention men."

345
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,054
And I said, "I don't study men."

346
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:48,796
And he said, "That's convenient."

347
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:53,100
(Laughter)

348
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:54,267
And I said, "Why?"

349
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,122
And he said, "Because
you say to reach out,

350
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,513
tell our story,

351
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:00,696
be vulnerable.

352
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:05,796
But you see those books you just signed
for my wife and my three daughters?"

353
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,966
I said, "Yeah."

354
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,101
"They'd rather me die
on top of my white horse

355
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,518
than watch me fall down.

356
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,796
When we reach out and be vulnerable,

357
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,527
we get the shit beat out of us.

358
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,428
And don't tell me

359
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:24,069
it's from the guys
and the coaches and the dads.

360
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:28,944
Because the women in my life
are harder on me than anyone else."

361
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,822
So I started interviewing men
and asking questions.

362
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,465
And what I learned is this:

363
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,767
You show me a woman
who can actually sit with a man

364
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,827
in real vulnerability and fear,

365
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,454
I'll show you a woman
who's done incredible work.

366
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,669
You show me a man who can sit with a woman

367
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,476
who's just had it,

368
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,952
she can't do it all anymore,

369
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,825
and his first response is not,

370
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,796
"I unloaded the dishwasher!"

371
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,332
(Laughter)

372
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,317
But he really listens --

373
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,796
because that's all we need --

374
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,963
I'll show you a guy
who's done a lot of work.

375
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,612
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

376
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,926
And to get out from underneath it --

377
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,593
to find our way back to each other,

378
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,498
we have to understand how it affects us

379
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,225
and how it affects
the way we're parenting,

380
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:23,106
the way we're working,
the way we're looking at each other.

381
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,695
Very quickly, some research
by Mahalik at Boston College.

382
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,420
He asked, what do women need to do
to conform to female norms?

383
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,550
The top answers in this country:

384
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:36,796
nice, thin, modest

385
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,062
and use all available
resources for appearance.

386
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,879
(Laughter)

387
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:42,216
When he asked about men,

388
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,668
what do men in this country need to do
to conform with male norms,

389
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,249
the answers were:

390
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,289
always show emotional control,

391
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,867
work is first,

392
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:54,147
pursue status and violence.

393
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,673
If we're going to find
our way back to each other,

394
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:59,796
we have to understand and know empathy,

395
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,796
because empathy's the antidote to shame.

396
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,732
If you put shame in a Petri dish,

397
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:07,065
it needs three things
to grow exponentially:

398
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:08,796
secrecy, silence and judgment.

399
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,735
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish
and douse it with empathy,

400
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,139
it can't survive.

401
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:17,471
The two most powerful words
when we're in struggle:

402
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:18,519
me too.

403
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,662
And so I'll leave you with this thought.

404
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:27,210
If we're going to find our way
back to each other,

405
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:30,004
vulnerability is going to be that path.

406
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,734
And I know it's seductive
to stand outside the arena,

407
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,619
because I think I did it my whole life,

408
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:36,896
and think to myself,

409
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,383
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass

410
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,843
when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.

411
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:45,232
And that is seductive.

412
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:47,975
But the truth is, that never happens.

413
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,837
And even if you got
as perfect as you could

414
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,449
and as bulletproof as you
could possibly muster

415
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,568
when you got in there,

416
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,092
that's not what we want to see.

417
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,127
We want you to go in.

418
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,856
We want to be with you
and across from you.

419
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,628
And we just want,

420
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:09,028
for ourselves and the people we care about

421
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,878
and the people we work with,

422
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:12,259
to dare greatly.

423
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,796
So thank you all very much.
I really appreciate it.

424
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,115
(Applause)
