1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
My favorite topic is

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
shortcuts.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
But I will demonstrate

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
different ways to get

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,820
rid of difficulties and go to the point,

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
to find an answer

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
probably much quicker than Arthur did. So,

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
first,

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
we violate the common sense,

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
90 degrees --

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
all of you. Not you.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
All of you, right? Palm up.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
If you do this,

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Do you agree?

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Good.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
But I will first teach you

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,820
a method, how you can do it without

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
moving the wrist, and then the shortcut.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
You can do it immediately, right?

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Hold the hand like this, palm up.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Don't move the wrist. The wrist is --

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,820
I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
Right-molded you say, with iron?

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
That was a joke, actually,

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
and I --

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
OK.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.

31
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Forward, don't move the wrist.

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
And forward. Yeah.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Now --

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,820
(Laughter) --

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
logic, logically,

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
(Laughter)

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Now, the shortcut.

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
(Laughter)

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
But it was six moves. Now with one move.

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,820
I start here, palm down, you can follow.

44
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
And then look at me.

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Yeah! (Laughter)

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
One move. OK.

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
So,

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
that was the warming up.

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Now,

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I need an assistant.

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
She has left. No! A big hand.

53
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
(Applause)

54
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
One item here was water, right?

56
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,820
And I will give my tribute

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
to water.

58
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about -- cheers.

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
(Laughter)

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Beer has about --

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
there's a lot of water in beer.

62
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
(Laughter)

63
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
So, now

64
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I will demonstrate different ways of

65
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
memorizing,

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
control cards and so on.

67
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And I think I'll take off this one.

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
I work with a special

69
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
method to do it, quick.

70
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
I work with

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
precision -- oh, sorry --

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
control

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
and

74
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
a very powerful ...

75
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
memory system, right?

76
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
(Laughter)

77
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
So,

78
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
if --

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
I have studied the poker. I like to gamble.

80
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Officially, I don't gamble but ...

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
So, if we are --

82
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
if we have five person,

83
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
and I will do a five-handed poker game.

84
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Now I will interact. So a different person

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
all the time, so not the same person can answer.

86
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
So we have an agreement.

87
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
Which one shall have a good poker hand?

88
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)

89
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Lennart Green: Three -- good.

90
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
And

91
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
here,

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
I had a mat here to make it a little --

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
the critical moment is -- sorry.

94
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
If a card shark gathers the cards together,

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
immediately when he --

96
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
before he deals the card. Now,

97
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
so I think, number three,

98
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
I have arranged them in a full house.

99
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,820
(Laughter)

100
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
With queens and -- it's OK --

101
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
queens and tens.

102
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
That's a challenge. I like this.

103
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,820
I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.

104
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
I start with three queens.

105
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
And two tens.

107
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Yeah. Thank you.

108
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,820
(Applause)

109
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,820
But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
So these guys have actually a stronger hand --

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
three aces and two kings.

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
This guy beats them with

113
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
four of a kind, or deuce -- deuce.

114
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
No reaction? That with even --

115
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
OK, and this.

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --

117
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,820
yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
and ...

119
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
But, of course, I will have the winning hand.

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Ten, jack,

121
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
queen, king, ace.

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
Yeah. So,

123
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
good.

124
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,820
(Laughter)

125
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
So the hand that looks so good from the beginning,

126
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
number three, at the end

127
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
was actually the lowest hand.

128
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Such life. Right?

129
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
So, please mix them.

130
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some

131
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
underground techniques.

132
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Yes?

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
I work with

134
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
kind of estimation,

135
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
shuffle tracking --

136
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
ah, good.

137
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Impressive. Thank you.

138
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
(Laughter)

139
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
So, first,

140
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
the first term is estimation.

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards

142
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
are put between

143
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
my royal flush.

144
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.

145
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Right? You agree.

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
So here I have, actually --

147
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
I know exactly where the cards are.

148
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
So here, I can make a bet,

149
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.

150
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
So here: 10, jack,

151
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
queen, king, ace.

152
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
OK.

153
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
(Applause)

154
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Next

155
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
is a term --

156
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I do it quick. I call this stealing.

157
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
So here, I think

158
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
I know about where the cards are.

159
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop,

160
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.

161
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Zoe: Stop.

162
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
LG: Here -- you see some are missing?

163
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
And that's the stealing cards, which I did.

164
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
(Laughter)

165
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
OK.

166
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Now, another term called shuffle tracking.

167
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,

168
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
even if another person shuffles.

169
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
This is a little risky.

170
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
So -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.

171
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
You agree? But if you square --

172
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
square, and shuffle,

173
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and then a cut.

174
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
So here,

175
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --

176
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.

177
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Come to -- no, no, no, no.

178
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm joking, yeah?

179
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Any style -- yeah, good.

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.

181
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I work direct with the right brain.

182
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
If you pass the left brain,

183
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
you have to take care of logic and common sense.

184
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so --

185
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
(Laughter) --

186
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Arthur Benjamin did

187
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
a little of the same thing.

188
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,

189
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
you have -- that's the password

190
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
to the

191
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
cosmic bank of knowledge,

192
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
where you can find any solution of any problem.

193
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
OK. Now, I drop the cards,

194
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
and you say stop anyway, right?

195
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Not at the last card.

196
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.

197
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.

198
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,820
(Laughter)

199
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Ah, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.

200
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
No, I'm kidding.

201
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,820
(Applause)

202
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
No, now and then I put in a mistake,

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
just to emphasize how difficult it is.

204
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Right?

205
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.

206
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
But now I'm glad I remember it.

207
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
So,

208
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
this deck is bought here. Sorry.

209
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
I have a little pad

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
to make it a little softer.

211
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
This deck is bought here in America.

212
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
It's called

213
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,

214
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
but not so many people know,

215
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,820
if you check, if you press at

216
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
the right spots,

217
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?

218
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Now, you can carry this in your wallet,

219
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
so ...

220
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
You don't see it, make no reaction?

221
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
(Laughter)

222
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
So, but here,

223
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
and --

224
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
is the camera getting too much? No.

225
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
(Laughter)

226
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)

227
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,820
LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.

228
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
But not too much.

229
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Then you have to push it down again.

230
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Here, please. If you push these

231
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
heaps -- everyone see --

232
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
push them together so they are really interlaced,

233
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
right? Yeah, good.

234
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Perfect.

235
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Just push them through, good. Thank you.

236
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And then, I will demonstrate a thing from

237
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Russian satellite,

238
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
stealen -- stolen,

239
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
probably copied from America but we will see.

240
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Here --

241
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.

242
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Now I go very quick

243
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
through the deck and try to find some pattern.

244
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
The new chaos theory is already old, right?

245
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
But you know, I think you are

246
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
familiar with fractals --

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.

248
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
And it's much

249
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
easier to memorize cards in a pattern way,

250
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,

251
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
then you go to --

252
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk

253
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
in another language ...

254
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Yeah, great.

255
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I think I have it.

256
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
So now, different persons, older, tap.

257
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Please name any card, anyone.

258
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.

259
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Jack of spades.

260
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.

261
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

262
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,820
nine, 10, 11,

263
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
12. Yes, right.

264
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
So -- oh, jack of spades.

265
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.

266
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.

267
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
So, jack of spades.

268
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I think ...

269
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
23 --

270
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
24, sorry, 24.

271
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

272
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

273
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

274
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
23 --

275
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
ah, 25, yes.

276
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
It's the last.

277
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Now, I do it quicker, better.

278
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --

279
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
(Laughter)

280
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
-- actually, my technique is to peek,

281
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
all the time.

282
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
When I lift the heap, I peek.

283
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
You see, yeah, perfect.

284
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate -- yeah, good.

285
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
(Laughter)

286
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)

287
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.

288
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
So I will do it quick,

289
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.

290
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
(Laughter)

291
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)

292
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.

293
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Good, thank you.

294
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
(Applause)

295
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
The thing I did -- I peeked.

296
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
I know where the card were,

297
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
then I chose it. So another person, another card.

298
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
(Laughter)

299
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Another person.

300
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

301
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
LG: Pardon?

302
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

303
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.

304
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
I think I do it the same way. I like to,

305
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
so I know where it is.

306
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Ten of diamonds.

307
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,820
But now I do it the regular speed, right?

308
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Ten of diamonds.

309
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Good.

310
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Maybe you will cut? Lift.

311
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
Excellent.

312
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
So, thank you. Another person, another card.

313
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
(Audience: Five of clubs.)

314
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)

315
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.

316
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.

317
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?

318
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Five of clubs.

319
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.

320
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
(Laughter)

321
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
We do it again.

322
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
The person who said five of clubs say stop,

323
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
when the cards are in the air, right?

324
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
(Audience: Stop.)

325
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
LG: Very good.

326
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
OK.

327
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,820
(Applause)

328
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
OK, I had to use a little force there.

329
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I think we save five of clubs.

330
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.

331
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.

332
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Excellent. I love that card.

333
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Here, I will do the most difficult thing.

334
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,

335
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
and you're betting,

336
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
and you let the other guys

337
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.

338
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And now, when I lift this card,

339
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
it shall be your card. What was your card?

340
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
(Audience: Queen of hearts.)

341
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.

342
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
So that's a tough challenge, right?

343
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,820
So here, I grab --

344
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
you know this? Five of clubs ...

345
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
and queen of hearts. Yes!

346
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
This is a tough one,

347
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
because here I must take advantage of --

348
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
I switch it with the five of clubs.

349
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
So, now

350
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
a false count.

351
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Which card shall I use? Queen or five?

352
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.

353
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.

354
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
The false count -- and the number

355
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
one, two, three,

356
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,820
four, five, six, seven, eight --

357
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
you say the same card all the time.

358
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Eight, nine, 10.

359
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
This is a kind of optical deal, right?

360
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
When I put one card at a table --

361
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
look, it's not one card. It's -- look,

362
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
it's a bunch of cards that gives this

363
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
impression.

364
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Yeah.

365
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Now some hard stuff.

366
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
I think we keep the queen here, yes.

367
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Now, to the satellites things.

368
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
This --

369
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.

370
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,820
(Laughter)

371
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
This is high-frequency laser,

372
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
and it's enough with a fraction of a second

373
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
to destroy the retina completely.

374
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Right, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.

375
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
But you can relax,

376
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
because it takes half an hour before it works,

377
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.

378
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
(Laughter)

379
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Now,

380
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
I put the laser here,

381
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
and --

382
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
now, when I deal the cards in the laser,

383
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
I know where they are but -- yes?

384
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Did the camera got it?

385
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
No?

386
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
They didn't?

387
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
What happened?

388
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
(Audience: It disappeared.)

389
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,820
LG: OK, I'll take another group.

390
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Do the cameras see the cards now?

391
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)

392
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
LG: But you see the hand.

393
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Ah, good, good, good. But now.

394
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
So now, that was the reason, right?

395
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
You see the cards? Yes.

396
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
(Laughter)

397
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Yeah, good.

398
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Now --

399
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
(Laughter)

400
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,820
-- one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,

401
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.

402
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
(Laughter)

403
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Yeah, interesting,

404
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
but a little dangerous.

405
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,820
(Laughter)

406
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
I liked it. Now,

407
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
a little more difficult.

408
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.

409
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.

410
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
So here,

411
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
here I have to peek, lots of cards.

412
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
I think there are lots of --

413
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?

414
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
(Laughter)

415
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,820
So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.

416
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Then I arrange them so I can

417
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
get them quick.

418
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,820
Perfect, excellent.

419
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
So I start with the ace --

420
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,820
yeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?

421
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
Same mistake as before, right?

422
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,820
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.

423
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,820
I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.

424
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
You see, I don't work with prestige,

425
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,820
so always do mistakes.

426
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
It doesn't matter to me.

427
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,820
And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?

428
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
One,

429
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
two, three, four -- yes,

430
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
the camera got it? Five, six,

431
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
seven, eight --

432
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
ah --

433
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
nine, 10,

434
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
the jack,

435
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
jack of spades,

436
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
queen of --

437
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,820
I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.

438
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
(Laughter)

439
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Wait, wait, wait -- please take any card.

440
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Grab any one. Quick, quick, good.

441
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
And we switch this to the king.

442
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Ace of diamonds.

443
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,820
And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide.

444
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
So I find ...

445
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
king of spades.

446
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct?

447
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Yeah? OK.

448
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
(Applause)

449
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Now, a little more difficult thing.

450
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already,

451
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
so you help me to shuffle again.

452
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Another suit, please.

453
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.)

454
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,820
(Laughter)

455
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820
LG: It was after the blindfold.

456
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
I like this guy, yeah.

457
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,820
OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.

458
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Armani -- who said Armani? You?

459
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,820
I drop the cards and you -- which size?

460
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.

461
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Which size?

462
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.

463
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Say stop. (Audience: Stop.)

464
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,820
(Laughter)

465
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
LG: Yeah, Armani. OK.

466
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:23,820
(Applause)

467
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Ah, this is tough.

468
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,820
OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.

469
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.

470
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
So, in this case,

471
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
I try to

472
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK.

473
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,820
We try. Yeah. You help me.

474
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
If I drop the card face up,

475
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK.

476
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,820
LG: OK, now.

477
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.

478
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,820
(Laughter)

479
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.

480
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,820
So here,

481
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,820
diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.

482
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
Stop. Do you see the pattern?

483
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
No? Now?

484
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Yes, yes, OK.

485
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,820
I work with pattern.

486
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Oh sorry, I dropped one.

487
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Maybe it's important --

488
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,820
yeah --

489
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
nine of diamonds, OK.

490
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
So now --

491
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
I always ask,

492
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,820
why do I put myself in this position?

493
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
I have to figure out so many outs,

494
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
when I miss some cards, but

495
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
I love it. So now,

496
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,820
I will do it. I will try to find

497
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,820
the diamonds,

498
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
but I will do it the hard way.

499
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,820
It's too easy to do it right away, right?

500
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,820
I think I will do it ...

501
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,820
blindfolded.

502
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
At this distance, it works immediately.

503
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Aargh!

504
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:21,820
(Laughter)

505
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Duct tape.

506
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,820
I look -- shake the cards, so I don't.

507
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy.

508
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Empathy.

509
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
But it was -- did you hear?

510
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.

511
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
(Laughter)

512
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
Yeah, good. Yeah.

513
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,820
You can take the nostril too, because some guys think --

514
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,820
(Laughter)

515
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,820
-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do

516
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
more. Go, go.

517
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Right? Good.

518
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
Satisfied?

519
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!

520
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
(Laughter)

521
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,820
No, with dignity and elegance, right?

522
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,820
But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.

523
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
And it was OK. One more?

524
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
The last.

525
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
OK.

526
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
All right.

527
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Now you must agree that I'm --

528
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,820
I must rely on other senses, right?

529
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,820
I work with vibration.

530
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,820
So,

531
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
what was the card?

532
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.

533
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,820
So now I have

534
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,820
to improvise again.

535
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.

536
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds.

537
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Just kidding, warming up -- king of hearts.

538
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,820
(Laughter)

539
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,820
And I give you a diamonds, so they -- so you put them here,

540
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,820
in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good.

541
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.

542
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,820
LG: Good. Good. Two -- (Applause) --

543
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,820
thank you.

544
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,820
I never ever miss two. This is interesting.

545
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
Always I've found two,

546
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.

547
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,820
And the deck is a gift to you after,

548
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,820
so let the skepticals here, in this,

549
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,820
examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift.

550
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Two -- and it was two of spades, right?

551
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now.

552
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,820
Three --

553
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
three of diamonds. Yes!

554
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Four --

555
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
I like challenges, yes.

556
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Yeah, good.

557
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Chris Anderson: You're peeking.

558
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
LG: Pardon?

559
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
CA: You're peeking. You just got to --

560
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
this is a request from the lady in the back.

561
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:13,820
(Laughter)

562
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Okay.

563
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Try that.

564
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,820
LG: Yeah. Also listen.

565
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,820
OK, now.

566
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
This is maybe a little tough.

567
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
We will try.

568
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,820
Yes? Good?

569
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,820
(Laughter)

570
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
OK. So,

571
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,820
how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.

572
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,820
LG: Four. Is five the next card?

573
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.

574
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.

575
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,820
LG: Oh.

576
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
So here,

577
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,820
all the cards are face down --

578
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,820
you agree? (Audience: Yes.)

579
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,820
LG: Yes? You see that in the screen?

580
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,820
And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.

581
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,820
So next card will be -- was it five?

582
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah --

583
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,820
I will reverse it face up here.

584
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Yes? Zoe: Yeah.

585
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,820
LG: Six -- six with the thumb.

586
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Seven.

587
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Yeah, I do this. I know where it is,

588
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,820
because I peeked before and then I do this.

589
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Right?

590
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Eight.

591
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,820
If --

592
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,820
and then nine, right?

593
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,820
Yeah.

594
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Yesterday -- the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas,

595
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820
and I used this actually.

596
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Nine? Yeah? Correct?

597
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.

598
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Ten --

599
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,820
once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.

600
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Yeah. Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack?

601
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Jack

602
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
of

603
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)

604
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
LG: Yes?

605
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
And

606
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,820
queen! Queen, with misdirection.

607
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Misdirection. (Applause)

608
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Yeah?

609
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,820
And then,

610
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,820
king, after exactly

611
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,820
five seconds.

612
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Yeah. Five. Five seconds.

613
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
One,

614
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,820
two, three, four -- mmm!

615
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
Check it.

616
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Yes?

617
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah!

618
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Good. Oh.

619
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
Touch me, feel --

620
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
ah, ah, you know!

621
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you.
