1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I grew up in New York City,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
between Harlem and the Bronx.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Growing up as a boy, we were taught

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
had to be courageous, dominating --

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
no pain, no emotions,

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
with the exception of anger --

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and definitely no fear;

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
that men are in charge,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
which means women are not;

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
that men lead,

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
and you should just follow and do what we say;

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
that men are superior; women are inferior;

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
that men are strong; women are weak;

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that women are of less value,

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
property of men,

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
and objects,

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
particularly sexual objects.

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
I've later come to know that to be

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
the collective socialization of men,

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
better known

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
as the "man box."

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
See this man box has in it

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
all the ingredients

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
of how we define what it means to be a man.

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
there are some wonderful, wonderful,

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
absolutely wonderful things

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
about being a man.

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
But at the same time,

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
there's some stuff

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
that's just straight up twisted,

33
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
and we really need to begin

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
to challenge, look at it

35
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
and really get in the process

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
of deconstructing, redefining,

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
what we come to know as manhood.

38
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
They're 11 and 12.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:

43
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Kendall and Jay.

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
(Laughter)

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
And when they were about five and six,

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
four and five,

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Jay could come to me,

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
come to me crying.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
It didn't matter what she was crying about,

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
just cry, cry it out.

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Now Kendall on the other hand --

54
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
he'd come to me crying,

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,

57
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
a clock would go off.

58
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,

59
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
which means, by the time he got to me,

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?

61
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Hold your head up. Look at me.

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Explain to me what's wrong.

63
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.

64
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Why are you crying?"

65
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
And out of my own frustration

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
of my role and responsibility

67
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
of building him up as a man

68
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
to fit into these guidelines

69
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
and these structures that are defining this man box,

70
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
I would find myself saying things like,

71
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
"Just go in your room.

72
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Just go on, go on in your room.

73
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Sit down,

74
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
get yourself together

75
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
and come back and talk to me

76
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
when you can talk to me like a --" what?

77
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
(Audience: Man.)

78
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Like a man.

79
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And he's five years old.

80
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
And as I grow in life,

81
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I would say to myself,

82
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
"My God, what's wrong with me?

83
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"

84
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
And I think back.

85
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I think back to my father.

86
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
There was a time in my life

87
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.

88
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
My brother, Henry, he died tragically

89
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
when we were teenagers.

90
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
We lived in New York City, as I said.

91
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
We lived in the Bronx at the time,

92
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,

93
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
it was about two hours outside of the city.

94
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
And as we were preparing

95
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
to come back from the burial,

96
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
the cars stopped at the bathroom

97
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
to let folks take care of themselves

98
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
before the long ride back to the city.

99
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
And the limousine empties out.

100
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,

101
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,

102
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and no sooner than the women got out,

103
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
he burst out crying.

104
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
He didn't want cry in front of me,

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,

106
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
and it was better me than to allow himself

107
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.

108
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And this is a man

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
who, 10 minutes ago,

110
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
had just put his teenage son

111
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
in the ground --

112
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
something I just can't even imagine.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
The thing that sticks with me the most

114
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is that he was apologizing to me

115
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
for crying in front of me,

116
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,

117
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
lifting me up,

118
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
for not crying.

119
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I come to also look at this

120
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
as this fear that we have as men,

121
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
this fear that just has us paralyzed,

122
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
holding us hostage

123
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
to this man box.

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
I can remember speaking

125
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,

126
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
and I asked him, I said,

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
"How would you feel if,

128
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
in front of all the players,

129
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"

130
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Now I expected him to say something like,

131
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.

132
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
No, the boy said to me --

133
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
the boy said to me,

134
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
"It would destroy me."

135
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
And I said to myself,

136
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
"God, if it would destroy him

137
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
to be called a girl,

138
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
what are we then teaching him

139
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
about girls?"

140
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,820
(Applause)

141
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
It took me back to a time

142
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
when I was about 12 years old.

143
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.

144
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
At this time we're living in the Bronx,

145
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.

146
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
He was about 16 years old,

147
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.

148
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.

149
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.

150
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,

151
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"

152
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.

153
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
He was a troubled kid.

154
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.

155
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
He was being raised by his grandmother.

156
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
His father wasn't on the set.

157
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
His grandmother had two jobs.

158
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
He was home alone a lot.

159
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,

160
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
we looked up to this dude, man.

161
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
He was cool. He was fine.

162
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."

163
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
He was having sex.

164
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
We all looked up to him.

165
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --

166
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.

167
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."

168
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.

169
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."

170
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Johnny call, you go.

171
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
So I run right upstairs.

172
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"

173
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Now I immediately knew what he meant.

174
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Because for me growing up at that time,

175
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and our relationship with this man box,

176
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:

177
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
sex or drugs --

178
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
and we weren't doing drugs.

179
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Now my box, my card,

180
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
my man box card,

181
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
was immediately in jeopardy.

182
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Two things: One, I never had sex.

183
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
We don't talk about that as men.

184
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,

185
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
the first time you had sex.

186
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.

187
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
There ain't no first time.

188
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
(Laughter)

189
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.

190
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.

191
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Women are objects,

192
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
especially sexual objects.

193
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.

194
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,

195
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."

196
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
He told me to go in his room.

197
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.

198
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
She's 16 years old.

199
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
She's nude.

200
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,

201
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
higher-functioning at times than others.

202
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.

203
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.

204
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.

205
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Because, while Sheila never said no,

206
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
she also never said yes.

207
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.

208
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
So when I go in the room, I close the door.

209
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Folks, I'm petrified.

210
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room

211
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
and see that I'm not doing anything,

212
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.

213
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;

214
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.

215
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
So in my 12 years of wisdom,

216
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I zip my pants down,

217
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
I walk out into the room,

218
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and lo and behold to me,

219
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
while I was in the room with Sheila,

220
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

221
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
So now there's a living room full of guys.

222
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.

223
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
And they asked me how was it,

224
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and I say to them, "It was good,"

225
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
and I zip my pants up in front of them,

226
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
and I head for the door.

227
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Now I say this all with remorse,

228
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,

229
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,

230
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
because I didn't get caught.

231
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.

232
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
This fear, getting outside the man box,

233
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
totally enveloped me.

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
It was way more important to me,

235
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
about me and my man box card

236
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
than about Sheila

237
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
and what was happening to her.

238
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
See collectively, we as men

239
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
are taught to have less value in women,

240
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
to view them as property and the objects of men.

241
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.

242
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
We as men, good men,

243
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
the large majority of men,

244
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
we operate on the foundation

245
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
of this whole collective socialization.

246
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.

247
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
You see, we have to come to understand

248
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation

249
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
and the violence can't happen without it.

250
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
So we're very much a part of the solution

251
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
as well as the problem.

252
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
The center for disease control says

253
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,

254
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
is the number one health concern for women

255
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
in this country and abroad.

256
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
So quickly, I'd like to just say,

257
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

258
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
The world I envision for her --

259
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?

260
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I need you on board. I need you with me.

261
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
I need you working with me and me working with you

262
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
on how we raise our sons

263
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
and teach them to be men --

264
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
that it's okay to not be dominating,

265
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,

266
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
that it's okay to promote equality,

267
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,

268
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
that it's okay to be whole,

269
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
that my liberation as a man

270
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)

271
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,

272
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
I asked a nine-year-old boy,

273
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
"What would life be like for you,

274
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"

275
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
He said to me, "I would be free."

276
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Thank you folks.

277
00:10:51,820 --> 00:11:03,820
(Applause)
