1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,796
I'm a storyteller.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,796
And I would like to tell you
a few personal stories

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,796
about what I like to call
"the danger of the single story."

4
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,796
I grew up on a university campus
in eastern Nigeria.

5
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:29,287
My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two,

6
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:32,327
although I think four
is probably close to the truth.

7
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:35,384
So I was an early reader,

8
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:38,796
and what I read were British
and American children's books.

9
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,796
I was also an early writer,

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,796
and when I began to write,
at about the age of seven,

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,868
stories in pencil
with crayon illustrations

12
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:51,424
that my poor mother was obligated to read,

13
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,016
I wrote exactly the kinds
of stories I was reading:

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,796
All my characters were
white and blue-eyed,

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,127
they played in the snow,

16
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,238
they ate apples,

17
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,659
(Laughter)

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,844
and they talked a lot about the weather,

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,996
how lovely it was
that the sun had come out.

20
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,193
(Laughter)

21
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:15,351
Now, this despite the fact
that I lived in Nigeria.

22
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,153
I had never been outside Nigeria.

23
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:22,224
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,096
and we never talked about the weather,

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,796
because there was no need to.

26
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,796
My characters also drank
a lot of ginger beer,

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,201
because the characters
in the British books I read

28
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,796
drank ginger beer.

29
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,796
Never mind that I had no idea
what ginger beer was.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,351
(Laughter)

31
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,825
And for many years afterwards,

32
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,796
I would have a desperate desire
to taste ginger beer.

33
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:43,796
But that is another story.

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,303
What this demonstrates, I think,

35
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:49,181
is how impressionable
and vulnerable we are

36
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:50,796
in the face of a story,

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,205
particularly as children.

38
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,229
Because all I had read were books
in which characters were foreign,

39
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:59,372
I had become convinced that books

40
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:02,566
by their very nature
had to have foreigners in them

41
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,309
and had to be about things with which
I could not personally identify.

42
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,039
Now, things changed
when I discovered African books.

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,796
There weren't many of them available,

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,689
and they weren't quite as easy to find
as the foreign books.

45
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:18,796
But because of writers like
Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,

46
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,796
I went through a mental shift
in my perception of literature.

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,034
I realized that people like me,

48
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,065
girls with skin the color of chocolate,

49
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:30,351
whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,

50
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,185
could also exist in literature.

51
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:35,796
I started to write
about things I recognized.

52
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,796
Now, I loved those
American and British books I read.

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,796
They stirred my imagination.
They opened up new worlds for me.

54
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,796
But the unintended consequence

55
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,868
was that I did not know
that people like me

56
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,318
could exist in literature.

57
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,796
So what the discovery of African writers
did for me was this:

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,697
It saved me from having a single story
of what books are.

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,796
I come from a conventional,
middle-class Nigerian family.

60
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,796
My father was a professor.

61
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,888
My mother was an administrator.

62
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,991
And so we had, as was the norm,

63
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:14,364
live-in domestic help, who would often
come from nearby rural villages.

64
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,288
So, the year I turned eight,
we got a new house boy.

65
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,176
His name was Fide.

66
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:25,779
The only thing my mother told us about him
was that his family was very poor.

67
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,796
My mother sent yams and rice,
and our old clothes, to his family.

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,440
And when I didn't finish my dinner,
my mother would say,

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,796
"Finish your food! Don't you know?
People like Fide's family have nothing."

70
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,796
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.

71
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,293
Then one Saturday,
we went to his village to visit,

72
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:49,796
and his mother showed us
a beautifully patterned basket

73
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,796
made of dyed raffia
that his brother had made.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,796
I was startled.

75
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,796
It had not occurred to me
that anybody in his family

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,796
could actually make something.

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,796
All I had heard about them
was how poor they were,

78
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,287
so that it had become impossible for me
to see them as anything else but poor.

79
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,334
Their poverty was my single story of them.

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,344
Years later, I thought about this
when I left Nigeria

81
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,050
to go to university in the United States.

82
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,494
I was 19.

83
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:23,018
My American roommate was shocked by me.

84
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,406
She asked where I had learned
to speak English so well,

85
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,518
and was confused when I said that Nigeria

86
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,256
happened to have English
as its official language.

87
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,796
She asked if she could listen
to what she called my "tribal music,"

88
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,796
and was consequently very disappointed

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,796
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.

90
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,796
(Laughter)

91
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,513
She assumed that I did not know
how to use a stove.

92
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,858
What struck me was this:

93
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:53,957
She had felt sorry for me
even before she saw me.

94
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:57,796
Her default position
toward me, as an African,

95
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,856
was a kind of patronizing,
well-meaning pity.

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,316
My roommate had a single story of Africa:

97
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,797
a single story of catastrophe.

98
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:09,518
In this single story,

99
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,796
there was no possibility of Africans
being similar to her in any way,

100
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,796
no possibility of feelings
more complex than pity,

101
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,796
no possibility of a connection
as human equals.

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,943
I must say that before I went to the U.S.,

103
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,248
I didn't consciously identify as African.

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,796
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,
people turned to me.

105
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,566
Never mind that I knew nothing
about places like Namibia.

106
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,916
But I did come to embrace
this new identity,

107
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,796
and in many ways I think
of myself now as African.

108
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,796
Although I still get quite irritable
when Africa is referred to as a country,

109
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,796
the most recent example being
my otherwise wonderful flight

110
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,105
from Lagos two days ago,

111
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,011
in which there was an announcement
on the Virgin flight

112
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:54,796
about the charity work in "India,
Africa and other countries."

113
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,137
(Laughter)

114
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:59,796
So, after I had spent some years
in the U.S. as an African,

115
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,994
I began to understand
my roommate's response to me.

116
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,845
If I had not grown up in Nigeria,

117
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:09,010
and if all I knew about Africa
were from popular images,

118
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:14,206
I too would think that Africa
was a place of beautiful landscapes,

119
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,796
beautiful animals,

120
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,796
and incomprehensible people,

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,451
fighting senseless wars,
dying of poverty and AIDS,

122
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,796
unable to speak for themselves

123
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,975
and waiting to be saved
by a kind, white foreigner.

124
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,917
I would see Africans
in the same way that I,

125
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:33,644
as a child, had seen Fide's family.

126
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,796
This single story of Africa ultimately
comes, I think, from Western literature.

127
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,796
Now, here is a quote from the writing
of a London merchant called John Locke,

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,796
who sailed to west Africa in 1561

129
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,483
and kept a fascinating
account of his voyage.

130
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:55,796
After referring to the black Africans
as "beasts who have no houses,"

131
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,796
he writes, "They are also
people without heads,

132
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,788
having their mouth and eyes
in their breasts."

133
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,916
Now, I've laughed
every time I've read this.

134
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,320
And one must admire
the imagination of John Locke.

135
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:13,059
But what is important about his writing

136
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,796
is that it represents the beginning

137
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,796
of a tradition of telling
African stories in the West:

138
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,187
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa
as a place of negatives,

139
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,454
of difference, of darkness,

140
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:28,796
of people who, in the words
of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,

141
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,761
are "half devil, half child."

142
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,796
And so, I began to realize
that my American roommate

143
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,796
must have throughout her life

144
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,796
seen and heard different versions
of this single story,

145
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,796
as had a professor,

146
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,586
who once told me that my novel
was not "authentically African."

147
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,380
Now, I was quite willing to contend

148
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:52,499
that there were a number of things
wrong with the novel,

149
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,796
that it had failed in a number of places,

150
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,059
but I had not quite imagined
that it had failed

151
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,796
at achieving something
called African authenticity.

152
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,526
In fact, I did not know
what African authenticity was.

153
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,216
The professor told me that my characters
were too much like him,

154
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,216
an educated and middle-class man.

155
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,342
My characters drove cars.

156
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,796
They were not starving.

157
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,747
Therefore they were not
authentically African.

158
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,796
But I must quickly add
that I too am just as guilty

159
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,890
in the question of the single story.

160
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,811
A few years ago,
I visited Mexico from the U.S.

161
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,487
The political climate in the U.S.
at the time was tense,

162
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:36,796
and there were debates going on
about immigration.

163
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,796
And, as often happens in America,

164
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,796
immigration became
synonymous with Mexicans.

165
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:44,451
There were endless stories of Mexicans

166
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,796
as people who were
fleecing the healthcare system,

167
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,796
sneaking across the border,

168
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,285
being arrested at the border,
that sort of thing.

169
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,796
I remember walking around
on my first day in Guadalajara,

170
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,796
watching the people going to work,

171
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,796
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,

172
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,793
smoking, laughing.

173
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:07,796
I remember first feeling slight surprise.

174
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,796
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.

175
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,796
I realized that I had been so immersed
in the media coverage of Mexicans

176
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
that they had become one thing in my mind,

177
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,669
the abject immigrant.

178
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,011
I had bought into
the single story of Mexicans

179
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:25,542
and I could not have
been more ashamed of myself.

180
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,438
So that is how to create a single story,

181
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:30,796
show a people as one thing,

182
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,796
as only one thing,

183
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,796
over and over again,

184
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,335
and that is what they become.

185
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:40,059
It is impossible to talk
about the single story

186
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,772
without talking about power.

187
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,064
There is a word, an Igbo word,

188
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,739
that I think about whenever I think about
the power structures of the world,

189
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,953
and it is "nkali."

190
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:54,796
It's a noun that loosely translates
to "to be greater than another."

191
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:58,302
Like our economic and political worlds,

192
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:02,796
stories too are defined
by the principle of nkali:

193
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,796
How they are told, who tells them,

194
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,057
when they're told,
how many stories are told,

195
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,288
are really dependent on power.

196
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,963
Power is the ability not just to tell
the story of another person,

197
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:18,796
but to make it the definitive
story of that person.

198
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,916
The Palestinian poet
Mourid Barghouti writes

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,796
that if you want to dispossess a people,

200
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,796
the simplest way to do it
is to tell their story

201
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,050
and to start with, "secondly."

202
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:34,202
Start the story with the arrows
of the Native Americans,

203
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:36,796
and not with the arrival of the British,

204
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,797
and you have an entirely different story.

205
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:44,253
Start the story with
the failure of the African state,

206
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,796
and not with the colonial
creation of the African state,

207
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,562
and you have an entirely different story.

208
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,796
I recently spoke at a university

209
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,605
where a student told me
that it was such a shame

210
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,748
that Nigerian men were physical abusers

211
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,716
like the father character in my novel.

212
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,796
I told him that I had just read a novel
called American Psycho --

213
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,796
(Laughter)

214
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,796
-- and that it was such a shame

215
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,796
that young Americans
were serial murderers.

216
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,796
(Laughter)

217
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,796
(Applause)

218
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,796
Now, obviously I said this
in a fit of mild irritation.

219
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,796
(Laughter)

220
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,011
But it would never have
occurred to me to think

221
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:35,796
that just because I had read a novel
in which a character was a serial killer

222
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,796
that he was somehow
representative of all Americans.

223
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,796
This is not because I am
a better person than that student,

224
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,796
but because of America's cultural
and economic power,

225
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,796
I had many stories of America.

226
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,796
I had read Tyler and Updike
and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.

227
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,380
I did not have a single story of America.

228
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,197
When I learned, some years ago,

229
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:01,562
that writers were expected
to have had really unhappy childhoods

230
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,796
to be successful,

231
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,820
I began to think about how I could invent
horrible things my parents had done to me.

232
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:09,796
(Laughter)

233
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,796
But the truth is that I had
a very happy childhood,

234
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,796
full of laughter and love,
in a very close-knit family.

235
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,031
But I also had grandfathers
who died in refugee camps.

236
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,796
My cousin Polle died because
he could not get adequate healthcare.

237
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,796
One of my closest friends,
Okoloma, died in a plane crash

238
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,796
because our fire trucks
did not have water.

239
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,796
I grew up under repressive
military governments

240
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,796
that devalued education,

241
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,796
so that sometimes, my parents
were not paid their salaries.

242
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,797
And so, as a child, I saw jam
disappear from the breakfast table,

243
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:45,318
then margarine disappeared,

244
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:47,796
then bread became too expensive,

245
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,691
then milk became rationed.

246
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,477
And most of all, a kind
of normalized political fear

247
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,183
invaded our lives.

248
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,780
All of these stories make me who I am.

249
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,796
But to insist on only
these negative stories

250
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,796
is to flatten my experience

251
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,484
and to overlook the many other
stories that formed me.

252
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,796
The single story creates stereotypes,

253
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,796
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,

254
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,796
but that they are incomplete.

255
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,780
They make one story become the only story.

256
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,392
Of course, Africa is a continent
full of catastrophes:

257
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,796
There are immense ones,
such as the horrific rapes in Congo

258
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,446
and depressing ones,

259
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,970
such as the fact that 5,000 people apply
for one job vacancy in Nigeria.

260
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,383
But there are other stories
that are not about catastrophe,

261
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,796
and it is very important, it is just
as important, to talk about them.

262
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,796
I've always felt that it is impossible

263
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,796
to engage properly
with a place or a person

264
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,796
without engaging with all of the stories
of that place and that person.

265
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,400
The consequence
of the single story is this:

266
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:59,381
It robs people of dignity.

267
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,796
It makes our recognition
of our equal humanity difficult.

268
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,984
It emphasizes how we are different
rather than how we are similar.

269
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,309
So what if before my Mexican trip,

270
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,796
I had followed the immigration
debate from both sides,

271
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,796
the U.S. and the Mexican?

272
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,796
What if my mother had told us
that Fide's family was poor

273
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,796
and hardworking?

274
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,916
What if we had an African
television network

275
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,796
that broadcast diverse
African stories all over the world?

276
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,151
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe
calls "a balance of stories."

277
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:37,151
What if my roommate knew
about my Nigerian publisher,

278
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,796
Muhtar Bakare,

279
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,868
a remarkable man who left
his job in a bank

280
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:43,797
to follow his dream
and start a publishing house?

281
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:47,508
Now, the conventional wisdom
was that Nigerians don't read literature.

282
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:48,786
He disagreed.

283
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,896
He felt that people
who could read, would read,

284
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,796
if you made literature affordable
and available to them.

285
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:58,796
Shortly after he published my first novel,

286
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,796
I went to a TV station
in Lagos to do an interview,

287
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,011
and a woman who worked there
as a messenger came up to me and said,

288
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,796
"I really liked your novel.
I didn't like the ending.

289
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,059
Now, you must write a sequel,
and this is what will happen ..."

290
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,797
(Laughter)

291
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,797
And she went on to tell me
what to write in the sequel.

292
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,796
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.

293
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,796
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
masses of Nigerians,

294
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,823
who were not supposed to be readers.

295
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,345
She had not only read the book,

296
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,178
but she had taken ownership of it

297
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:32,305
and felt justified in telling me
what to write in the sequel.

298
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,796
Now, what if my roommate knew
about my friend Fumi Onda,

299
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,796
a fearless woman who hosts
a TV show in Lagos,

300
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
and is determined to tell the stories
that we prefer to forget?

301
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:46,796
What if my roommate knew
about the heart procedure

302
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,796
that was performed in the Lagos
hospital last week?

303
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,796
What if my roommate knew
about contemporary Nigerian music,

304
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,796
talented people singing
in English and Pidgin,

305
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,796
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,

306
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,796
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela

307
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,002
to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.

308
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,059
What if my roommate knew
about the female lawyer

309
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,796
who recently went to court in Nigeria
to challenge a ridiculous law

310
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,796
that required women to get
their husband's consent

311
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,796
before renewing their passports?

312
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,796
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,

313
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,200
full of innovative people making
films despite great technical odds,

314
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:26,796
films so popular

315
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,796
that they really are the best example
of Nigerians consuming what they produce?

316
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,106
What if my roommate knew about
my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,

317
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,796
who has just started her own business
selling hair extensions?

318
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,796
Or about the millions of other Nigerians
who start businesses and sometimes fail,

319
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,758
but continue to nurse ambition?

320
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,796
Every time I am home I am confronted

321
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,796
with the usual sources of irritation
for most Nigerians:

322
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,264
our failed infrastructure,
our failed government,

323
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,343
but also by the incredible resilience

324
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,796
of people who thrive
despite the government,

325
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,081
rather than because of it.

326
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,796
I teach writing workshops
in Lagos every summer,

327
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,796
and it is amazing to me
how many people apply,

328
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,796
how many people are eager to write,

329
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,206
to tell stories.

330
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:17,118
My Nigerian publisher and I
have just started a non-profit

331
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,796
called Farafina Trust,

332
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,796
and we have big dreams
of building libraries

333
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,963
and refurbishing libraries
that already exist

334
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,796
and providing books for state schools

335
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,916
that don't have anything
in their libraries,

336
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,321
and also of organizing lots
and lots of workshops,

337
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,796
in reading and writing,

338
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,019
for all the people who are eager
to tell our many stories.

339
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,796
Stories matter.

340
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,796
Many stories matter.

341
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,796
Stories have been used
to dispossess and to malign,

342
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,796
but stories can also be used
to empower and to humanize.

343
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,796
Stories can break the dignity of a people,

344
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,523
but stories can also repair
that broken dignity.

345

The American writer
Alice Walker wrote this

346
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:01,796
about her Southern relatives
who had moved to the North.

347
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,796
She introduced them to a book about

348
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,888
the Southern life
that they had left behind.

349
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:10,796
"They sat around,
reading the book themselves,

350
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,348
listening to me read the book,
and a kind of paradise was regained."

351
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,261
I would like to end with this thought:

352
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,796
That when we reject the single story,

353
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,796
when we realize that
there is never a single story

354
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,261
about any place,

355
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,796
we regain a kind of paradise.

356
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:31,637
Thank you.

357
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:34,661
