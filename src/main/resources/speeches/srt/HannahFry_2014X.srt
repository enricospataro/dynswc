1
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:16,761
Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love.

2
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,501
Now, I think that we can all agree

3
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:23,417
that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love.

4
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,865
But it's not just
because of our dashing personalities,

5
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:31,364
superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,890
It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,282
of how to find the perfect partner.

8
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:41,695
Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled,

9
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:45,191
"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" --
(Laughter) --

10
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:48,911
Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love.

11
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:51,277
Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.

12
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:53,362
Of all of the available women in the U.K.,

13
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:56,775
all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him,

14
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,676
somebody in the right age range,

15
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:01,486
somebody with a university degree,

16
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,644
somebody he's likely to get on well with,

17
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,720
somebody who's likely to be attractive,

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,258
somebody who's likely 
to find him attractive.

19
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:11,261
(Laughter)

20
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:16,247
And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK.

21
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,422
It's not looking very good, 
is it Peter?

22
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:21,289
Now, just to put that into perspective,

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,394
that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates

24
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:28,619
of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are.

25
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,496
And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance

26
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,722
of bumping into any one
of these special ladies

27
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,108
on a given night out.

28
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,311
I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians

29
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:42,735
don't really bother
going on nights out anymore.

30
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,464
The thing is that I personally

31
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:47,193
don't subscribe
to such a pessimistic view.

32
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,422
Because I know,
just as well as all of you do,

33
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:52,014
that love doesn't really work like that.

34
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:57,124
Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
and rational and easily predictable.

35
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,531
But I also know that that doesn't mean

36
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,835
that mathematics hasn't got something
that it can offer us

37
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:06,786
because, love, as with most of life,
is full of patterns

38
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:10,862
and mathematics is, ultimately,
all about the study of patterns.

39
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:15,165
Patterns from predicting the weather
to the fluctuations in the stock market,

40
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:18,570
to the movement of the planets
or the growth of cities.

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,274
And if we're being honest,
none of those things

42
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,670
are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either.

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,697
Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential

44
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:33,451
to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything.

45
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,007
Even something as mysterious as love.

46
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:38,495
And so, to try to persuade you

47
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:43,056
of how totally amazing, excellent
and relevant mathematics is,

48
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:51,040
I want to give you my top three
mathematically verifiable tips for love.

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,759
Okay, so Top Tip #1:

50
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,723
How to win at online dating.

51
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:01,979
So my favorite online dating 
website is OkCupid,

52
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,394
not least because it was started
by a group of mathematicians.

53
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,163
Now, because they're mathematicians,

54
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:08,903
they have been collecting data

55
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:11,756
on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade.

56
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:14,020
And they've been trying 
to search for patterns

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,887
in the way that we talk about ourselves

58
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:18,004
and the way that we 
interact with each other

59
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,696
on an online dating website.

60
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:22,645
And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings.

61
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,267
But my particular favorite

62
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,647
is that it turns out
that on an online dating website,

63
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:33,492
how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are,

64
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:37,211
and actually, having people
think that you're ugly

65
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,080
can work to your advantage.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,886
Let me show you how this works.

67
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:46,385
In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid,

68
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:49,385
you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are

69
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:51,842
on a scale between 1 and 5.

70
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:55,182
Now, if we compare this score, 
the average score,

71
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:58,036
to how many messages a
selection of people receive,

72
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,696
you can begin to get a sense

73
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:03,674
of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website.

74
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:06,997
This is the graph that the OkCupid guys
have come up with.

75
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,050
And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true

76
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,878
that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get.

77
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,752
But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here

78
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:21,386
who are so much more popular
than people down here,

79
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,990
even though they have the
same score of attractiveness?

80
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,519
And the reason why is that it's not just 
straightforward looks that are important.

81
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,297
So let me try to illustrate their
findings with an example.

82
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:35,427
So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example,

83
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:40,099
everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman.

84
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,760
Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,381
If you compare Portia de Rossi
to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,

86
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,666
now, a lot of people, 
myself included, I should say,

87
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,140
think that Sarah Jessica Parker
is seriously fabulous

88
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,810
and possibly one of the
most beautiful creatures

89
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,459
to have ever have walked 
on the face of the Earth.

90
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:07,480
But some other people, 
i.e., most of the Internet,

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,658
seem to think that she looks 
a bit like a horse. (Laughter)

92
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:16,918
Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought

93
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,080
Sarah Jessica Parker 
or Portia de Rossi were,

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,033
and you ask them to give 
them a score between 1 and 5,

95
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,038
I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score.

96
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,799
But the way that people would vote
would be very different.

97
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,342
So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the 4

98
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,802
because everybody agrees 
that she's very beautiful,

99
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,463
whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion.

100
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,887
There'd be a huge spread in her scores.

101
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,209
And actually it's this spread that counts.

102
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,685
It's this spread
that makes you more popular

103
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,885
on an online Internet dating website.

104
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,056
So what that means then

105
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,555
is that if some people
think that you're attractive,

106
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,503
you're actually better off

107
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:55,755
having some other people
think that you're a massive minger.

108
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,993
That's much better
than everybody just thinking

109
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:59,724
that you're the cute girl next door.

110
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,973
Now, I think this begins 
makes a bit more sense

111
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:05,207
when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages.

112
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,558
So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive,

113
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:11,812
but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested.

114
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,363
That means there's
less competition for you

115
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,799
and it's an extra incentive
for you to get in touch.

116
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,623
Whereas compare that 
to if you think somebody is attractive

117
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,880
but you suspect that everybody 
is going to think they're attractive.

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,444
Well, why would you bother 
humiliating yourself, let's be honest?

119
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,724
Here's where the really
interesting part comes.

120
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:33,198
Because when people choose the pictures
that they use on an online dating website,

121
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,490
they often try to minimize the things

122
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,980
that they think some people 
will find unattractive.

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,277
The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight

124
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,741
deliberately choosing 
a very cropped photo,

125
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,498
or bald men, for example,

126
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:51,297
deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats.

127
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,962
But actually this is the opposite 
of what you should do

128
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,356
if you want to be successful.

129
00:06:55,356 --> 00:07:00,167
You should really, instead, play up to 
whatever it is that makes you different,

130
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:04,120
even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive.

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,364
Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway,

132
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:12,305
and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage.

133
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,717
Okay, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner.

134
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,444
So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success

135
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,912
on the dating scene.

136
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:23,215
But the question arises 
of how do you then convert that success

137
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:26,999
into longer-term happiness
and in particular,

138
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:31,257
how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down?

139
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:34,089
Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in

140
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,112
and marry the first person
who comes along

141
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,325
and shows you any interest at all.

142
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,479
But, equally, you don't really 
want to leave it too long

143
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,481
if you want to maximize your 
chance of long-term happiness.

144
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,663
As my favorite author, 
Jane Austen, puts it,

145
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:49,881
"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty

146
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:53,546
can never hope to feel or
inspire affection again."

147
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,538
(Laughter)

148
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:59,092
Thanks a lot, Jane.
What do you know about love?

149
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,211
So the question is then,

150
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,816
how do you know when 
is the right time to settle down

151
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,495
given all the people 
that you can date in your lifetime?

152
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:10,170
Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use

153
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,694
to help us out here, called
optimal stopping theory.

154
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,594
So let's imagine then,

155
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,864
that you start dating when you're 15

156
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:20,948
and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35.

157
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,488
And there's a number of people

158
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:24,974
that you could potentially
date across your lifetime,

159
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:27,128
and they'll be at varying 
levels of goodness.

160
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:30,019
Now the rules are that once 
you cash in and get married,

161
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,722
you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had,

162
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,332
and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind.

163
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,902
In my experience at least,

164
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:39,724
I find that typically people don't
much like being recalled

165
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:45,140
years after being passed up 
for somebody else, or that's just me.

166
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,347
So the math says then
that what you should do

167
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:51,378
in the first 37 percent 
of your dating window,

168
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:55,819
you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential.

169
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,333
(Laughter)

170
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,139
And then, you should pick the 
next person that comes along

171
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,974
that is better than everybody 
that you've seen before.

172
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:05,296
So here's the example.

173
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,128
Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact,

174
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,795
that this is the best possible way

175
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:15,257
of maximizing your chances 
of finding the perfect partner.

176
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:19,729
Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks.

177
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:24,892
For instance, imagine if 
your perfect partner appeared

178
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:28,046
during your first 37 percent.

179
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:30,759
Now, unfortunately, 
you'd have to reject them.

180
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,472
(Laughter)

181
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,817
Now, if you're following the maths,

182
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,483
I'm afraid no one else comes along

183
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,610
that's better than anyone
you've seen before,

184
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,913
so you have to go on 
rejecting everyone and die alone.

185
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:45,596
(Laughter)

186
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:51,437
Probably surrounded by cats
nibbling at your remains.

187
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:55,242
Okay, another risk is, 
let's imagine, instead,

188
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:58,487
that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent

189
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:02,327
are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people.

190
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:05,052
Now, that's okay, because 
you're in your rejection phase,

191
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,893
so thats fine, 
you can reject them.

192
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:10,361
But then imagine, the next
person to come along

193
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:14,699
is just marginally less boring, 
dull and terrible

194
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,581
than everybody that you've seen before.

195
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:20,783
Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them

196
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:24,196
and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal.

197
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,279
Sorry about that.

198
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,479
But I do think that there's
an opportunity here

199
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,629
for Hallmark to cash in on
and really cater for this market.

200
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,719
A Valentine's Day card like this.
(Laughter)

201
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:36,744
"My darling husband, you
are marginally less terrible

202
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,789
than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."

203
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:45,276
It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage.

204
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:49,958
Okay, so this method doesn't give
you a 100 percent success rate,

205
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,261
but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better.

206
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,924
And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types

207
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:59,637
of fish which follow and
employ this exact strategy.

208
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,276
So they reject every possible 
suitor that turns up

209
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:05,233
in the first 37 percent 
of the mating season,

210
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,764
and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window

211
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:10,820
that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier

212
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,338
than all of the fish 
that they've seen before.

213
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:18,016
I also think that subconsciously,
humans, we do sort of do this anyway.

214
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:21,433
We give ourselves a little bit of time
to play the field,

215
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,935
get a feel for the marketplace 
or whatever when we're young.

216
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:29,843
And then we only start looking seriously
at potential marriage candidates

217
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,733
once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.

218
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,536
I think this is conclusive proof,
if ever it were needed,

219
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:39,042
that everybody's brains are prewired 
to be just a little bit mathematical.

220
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,297
Okay, so that was Top Tip #2.

221
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:44,550
Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.

222
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,688
Okay, so let's imagine then
that you picked your perfect partner

223
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:52,465
and you're settling into
a lifelong relationship with them.

224
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:56,539
Now, I like to think that everybody
would ideally like to avoid divorce,

225
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,905
apart from, I don't know, 
Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?

226
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,295
But it's a sad fact of modern life

227
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:08,104
that 1 in 2 marriages in the
States ends in divorce,

228
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:11,405
with the rest of the world
not being far behind.

229
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,504
Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps

230
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:17,164
for thinking that the arguments
that precede a marital breakup

231
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:20,697
are not an ideal candidate
for mathematical investigation.

232
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,597
For one thing, it's very hard to know

233
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:25,654
what you should be measuring 
or what you should be quantifying.

234
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:32,227
But this didn't stop a psychologist,
John Gottman, who did exactly that.

235
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:37,422
Gottman observed hundreds of couples
having a conversation

236
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,884
and recorded, well, 
everything you can think of.

237
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,371
So he recorded what was said 
in the conversation,

238
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:44,434
he recorded their skin conductivity,

239
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,354
he recorded their facial expressions,

240
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,694
their heart rates, their blood pressure,

241
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:55,144
basically everything apart from whether
or not the wife was actually always right,

242
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:58,168
which incidentally she totally is.

243
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,088
But what Gottman and his team found

244
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,592
was that one of the
most important predictors

245
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,742
for whether or not a couple
is going to get divorced

246
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:10,842
was how positive or negative each 
partner was being in the conversation.

247
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:13,454
Now, couples that were very low-risk

248
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:17,681
scored a lot more positive points
on Gottman's scale than negative.

249
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,821
Whereas bad relationships,

250
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,613
by which I mean, probably
going to get divorced,

251
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:27,225
they found themselves getting 
into a spiral of negativity.

252
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,578
Now just by using these very simple ideas,

253
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,080
Gottman and his group were able to predict

254
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,923
whether a given couple
was going to get divorced

255
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,578
with a 90 percent accuracy.

256
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:40,972
But it wasn't until he teamed up
with a mathematician, James Murray,

257
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,111
that they really started to understand

258
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:47,421
what causes these negativity spirals 
and how they occur.

259
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,128
And the results that they found

260
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:53,487
I think are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting.

261
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:57,825
So these equations, they predict how 
the wife or husband is going to respond

262
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,791
in their next turn of the conversation,

263
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,919
how positive or negative
they're going to be.

264
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,716
And these equations, they depend on

265
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:06,062
the mood of the person 
when they're on their own,

266
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,676
the mood of the person when
they're with their partner,

267
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:10,665
but most importantly, they depend on

268
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:13,644
how much the husband and wife
influence one another.

269
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,352
Now, I think it's important 
to point out at this stage,

270
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:19,672
that these exact equations 
have also been shown

271
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:22,318
to be perfectly able at describing

272
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:26,076
what happens between two
countries in an arms race.

273
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,214
(Laughter)

274
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,725
So that -- an arguing couple
spiraling into negativity

275
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,639
and teetering on the brink of divorce --

276
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,927
is actually mathematically equivalent to
the beginning of a nuclear war.

277
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,426
(Laughter)

278
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:44,979
But the really important term
in this equation

279
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,697
is the influence that people
have on one another,

280
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:50,720
and in particular, something called 
the negativity threshold.

281
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,399
Now, the negativity threshold,

282
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,892
you can think of as
how annoying the husband can be

283
00:14:56,892 --> 00:15:01,074
before the wife starts to get 
really pissed off, and vice versa.

284
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:06,228
Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding

285
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:09,081
and allowing the person to 
have the space to be themselves.

286
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:12,378
So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships

287
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,844
were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold.

288
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,512
Where couples let things go

289
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:20,307
and only brought things up if 
they really were a big deal.

290
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:23,843
But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team

291
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:27,138
have shown the exact opposite is true.

292
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,527
The best couples,
or the most successful couples,

293
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:33,339
are the ones with a really low 
negativity threshold.

294
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,198
These are the couples that don't
let anything go unnoticed

295
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,219
and allow each other 
some room to complain.

296
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:45,553
These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship,

297
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,238
that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage.

298
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,336
Couples that don't let things go

299
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:56,246
and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal.

300
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:01,843
Now of course, it takes bit more than 
just a low negativity threshold

301
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:05,982
and not compromising to
have a successful relationship.

302
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,470
But I think that it's quite interesting

303
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,873
to know that there is really
mathematical evidence

304
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:14,300
to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger.

305
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,008
So those are my top three tips

306
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,203
of how maths can help you
with love and relationships.

307
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,646
But I hope
that aside from their use as tips,

308
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:25,748
they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics.

309
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:30,113
Because for me, equations 
and symbols aren't just a thing.

310
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:34,939
They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature

311
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:36,749
and the startling simplicity

312
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:41,204
in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us,

313
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:44,007
from how the world works to how we behave.

314
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,305
So I hope that perhaps,
for just a couple of you,

315
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,746
a little bit of insight into
the mathematics of love

316
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,954
can persuade you to have 
a little bit more love for mathematics.

317
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,341
Thank you.

318
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,635
(Applause)
