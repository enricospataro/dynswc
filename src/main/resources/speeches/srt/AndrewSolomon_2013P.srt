1
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:16,424
"Even in purely non-religious terms,

2
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:22,479
homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.

3
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:27,105
It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality --

4
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,505
a pitiable flight from life.

5
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:33,328
As such, it deserves no compassion,

6
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:35,890
it deserves no treatment

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,657
as minority martyrdom,

8
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:45,335
and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."

9
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:50,557
That's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.

10
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:54,471
And last year, the president of the United States

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,054
came out in favor of gay marriage.

12
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:04,503
(Applause)

13
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:10,205
And my question is, how did we get from there to here?

14
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:14,945
How did an illness become an identity?

15
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:17,905
When I was perhaps six years old,

16
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,838
I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.

17
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:23,245
And at the end of buying our shoes,

18
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:27,037
the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.

19
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:32,703
My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.

20
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:37,618
My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.

21
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,754
But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.

22
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:46,173
And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.

23
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:50,963
The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay --

24
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:54,071
(Laughter) --

25
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,443
is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.

26
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:00,510
(Laughter)

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:07,377
(Applause)

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,918
When I was little, my mother used to say,

29
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:14,470
"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,815
And until you have children, you don't know what it's like."

31
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:21,009
And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world

32
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,829
that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.

33
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,457
And when I was an adolescent, I thought

34
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,821
that I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.

35
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,198
And when she said it, it made me anxious.

36
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,724
And after I came out of the closet,

37
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,924
when she continued to say it, it made me furious.

38
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:41,065
I said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.

39
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:44,110
And I want you to stop saying that."

40
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,890
About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine

41
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,331
to write a piece about deaf culture.

42
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,168
And I was rather taken aback.

43
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,363
I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.

44
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,089
Those poor people, they couldn't hear.

45
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,863
They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?

46
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,980
And then I went out into the deaf world.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,371
I went to deaf clubs.

48
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:11,291
I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.

49
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:17,502
I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee

50
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:21,346
where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.

51
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:25,602
(Laughter)

52
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:29,529
And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,

53
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:32,535
I become convinced that deafness was a culture

54
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,897
and that the people in the deaf world who said,

55
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:38,264
"We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"

56
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:40,841
were saying something that was viable.

57
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,346
It wasn't my culture,

58
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:45,064
and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,

59
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,895
but I appreciated that it was a culture

60
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,030
and that for the people who were members of it,

61
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,319
it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,319
It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.

63
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,733
Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.

64
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,212
And when her daughter was born,

65
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,528
she suddenly found herself confronting questions

66
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,330
that now began to seem quite resonant to me.

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,197
She was facing the question of what to do with this child.

68
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:18,657
Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"

69
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:21,872
Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,

70
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,419
get involved in the Little People of America,

71
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,212
become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?

72
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,813
And I suddenly thought,

73
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:31,032
most deaf children are born to hearing parents.

74
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:33,831
Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.

75
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:37,997
Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.

76
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:40,346
Most gay people are born to straight parents.

77
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,794
Those straight parents often want them to function

78
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,064
in what they think of as the mainstream world,

79
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:48,668
and those gay people have to discover identity later on.

80
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,284
And here was this friend of mine

81
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:53,613
looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.

82
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,389
And I thought, there it is again:

83
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,955
A family that perceives itself to be normal

84
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,325
with a child who seems to be extraordinary.

85
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:04,837
And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.

86
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,761
There are vertical identities,

87
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,743
which are passed down generationally from parent to child.

88
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:15,346
Those are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.

89
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:19,824
Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.

90
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:22,097
And while some of them can be difficult,

91
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,291
there's no attempt to cure them.

92
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,703
You can argue that it's harder in the United States --

93
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,677
our current presidency notwithstanding --

94
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,510
to be a person of color.

95
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,209
And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure

96
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,097
that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians

97
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,486
come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.

98
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:45,763
There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.

99
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,061
And I call them horizontal identities,

100
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:50,956
because the peer group is the horizontal experience.

101
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:53,524
These are identities that are alien to your parents

102
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:57,709
and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.

103
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:00,794
And those identities, those horizontal identities,

104
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,510
people have almost always tried to cure.

105
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,178
And I wanted to look at what the process is

106
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:09,395
through which people who have those identities

107
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:12,123
come to a good relationship with them.

108
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:16,376
And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance

109
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,815
that needed to take place.

110
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:23,364
There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.

111
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:25,311
And they don't always coincide.

112
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:29,447
And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry

113
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:32,511
because they feel as though their parents don't love them,

114
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,810
when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.

115
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,976
Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally

116
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:43,023
throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.

117
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:46,289
But acceptance is something that takes time.

118
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,524
It always takes time.

119
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:53,416
One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.

120
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,818
When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,

121
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,596
a very disabling condition,

122
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:02,002
and his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,

123
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,977
he would have no intellectual capacity,

124
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,676
and he would probably not even recognize them.

125
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,097
And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital

126
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,311
so that he could die there quietly.

127
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,275
And his mother said she wasn't going to do it.

128
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,042
And she took her son home.

129
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:19,676
And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,

130
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,624
she found the best doctor in the country

131
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,823
for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,

132
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,989
and she got Clinton enrolled with him.

133
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,070
And in the course of his childhood,

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,143
he had 30 major surgical procedures.

135
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,330
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital

136
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,023
while he was having those procedures,

137
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,431
as a result of which he now can walk.

138
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,781
And while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.

139
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,610
And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.

140
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,357
And he ended up achieving at a level

141
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:49,932
that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.

142
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:53,262
He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,

143
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:56,644
where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car

144
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,428
that accommodated his unusual body.

145
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,391
And his mother told me this story of coming home one day --

146
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,156
and he went to college nearby --

147
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:07,243
and she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,

148
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:11,666
in the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter)

149
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:16,276
"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.

150
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,576
Two beers for them is four beers for him."

151
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:21,189
She said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,

152
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,377
but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."

153
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:26,862
She said, "And then I thought,

154
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,962
if someone had said to me when he was born

155
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:34,575
that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- "

156
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:43,357
(Applause)

157
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,396
And I said to her, "What do you think you did

158
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:49,856
that helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"

159
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:54,543
And she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.

160
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:57,679
Clinton just always had that light in him.

161
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:04,092
And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."

162
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:07,130
I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.

163
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,824
This one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America --

164
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:15,628
written by an important bioethicist.

165
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:19,436
He said, "There is no reason to feel guilty

166
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:22,741
about putting a Down syndrome child away,

167
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:27,800
whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium

168
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,709
or in a more responsible, lethal sense.

169
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,657
It is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.

170
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:40,757
True guilt arises only from an offense against a person,

171
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:45,358
and a Down's is not a person."

172
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:49,299
There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made

173
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,426
in the treatment of gay people.

174
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:55,462
The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.

175
00:09:55,462 --> 00:10:00,158
But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,

176
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,296
how we used to see people who were disabled,

177
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:05,209
how inhuman we held people to be.

178
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,087
And the change that's been accomplished there,

179
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,913
which is almost equally radical,

180
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:11,789
is one that we pay not very much attention to.

181
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:15,741
One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,

182
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:19,469
were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,

183
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,924
their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.

184
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:27,010
They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,

185
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,863
and so they decided they would build a little center --

186
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,527
two classrooms that they started with a few other parents --

187
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,990
to educate kids with D.S.

188
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,890
And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,

189
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,047
where there are now thousands upon thousands

190
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:46,824
of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.

191
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:49,962
In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,

192
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:54,135
the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.

193
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:58,894
The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,

194
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:04,947
those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.

195
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,822
The Robards had a lot to do with that.

196
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,356
And I said, "Do you regret it?

197
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,959
Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?

198
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,808
Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"

199
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,175
And interestingly his father said,

200
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,762
"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,

201
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:21,142
because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,

202
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,890
and I'd like to give David an easier life.

203
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,990
But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."

204
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,421
And Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.

205
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:36,362
For David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.

206
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:41,798
But speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born

207
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,808
that I could come to such a point --

208
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:48,156
speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder

209
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:51,190
and so much more purposeful in my whole life,

210
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:57,599
that speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."

211
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,984
We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions

212
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,722
is on the up and up.

213
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,558
And yet we also live at the moment

214
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,449
when our ability to eliminate those conditions

215
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,057
has reached a height we never imagined before.

216
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:14,201
Most deaf infants born in the United States now

217
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,009
will receive Cochlear implants,

218
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:20,824
which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,

219
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:25,842
and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.

220
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:30,141
A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,

221
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:35,194
is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.

222
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:37,939
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,

223
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,906
and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,

224
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,824
grow to full size.

225
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:46,375
Testing in humans is around the corner.

226
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,631
There are blood tests which are making progress

227
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:54,126
that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,

228
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:59,355
making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,

229
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,690
or to terminate them.

230
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,357
And so we have both social progress and medical progress.

231
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:07,209
And I believe in both of them.

232
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,264
I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,

233
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:14,360
and I think the same thing about the medical progress.

234
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,723
But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.

235
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,794
And when I see the way they're intersecting

236
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,008
in conditions like the three I've just described,

237
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:26,658
I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera

238
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:29,262
when the hero realizes he loves the heroine

239
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:33,709
at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.

240
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,508
(Laughter)

241
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:40,390
We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.

242
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,256
And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,

243
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,108
what do we validate in our children,

244
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,860
and what do we cure in them?

245
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,031
Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,

246
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,685
"When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,'

247
00:13:55,685 --> 00:14:00,544
what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist

248
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:04,563
and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.'

249
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:09,355
Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.

250
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:12,557
This is what we hear when you pray for a cure --

251
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:14,462
that your fondest wish for us

252
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,841
is that someday we will cease to be

253
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:22,396
and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."

254
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,462
It's a very extreme point of view,

255
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:29,591
but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have

256
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:34,156
and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.

257
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:37,376
They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.

258
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,176
One of the families I interviewed for this project

259
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:46,430
was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.

260
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,225
It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,

261
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,989
and once they agreed, they were so full of their story

262
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,688
that they couldn't stop telling it.

263
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:56,305
And the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many --

264
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:59,426
I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.

265
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:01,689
And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.

266
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,575
We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.

267
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:07,096
And I said, "If Dylan were here now,

268
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,941
do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"

269
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,309
And his father said, "I sure do.

270
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,858
I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."

271
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:19,496
And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.

272
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,675
And then she looked back up and said,

273
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:25,738
"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother

274
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:30,162
and never knowing what was going on inside his head."

275
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,130
When I had dinner with her a couple of years later --

276
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,057
one of many dinners that we had together --

277
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:38,467
she said, "You know, when it first happened,

278
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:42,275
I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.

279
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,767
If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,

280
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:49,409
this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.

281
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:53,924
But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much

282
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:57,227
that I don't want to imagine a life without them.

283
00:15:57,227 --> 00:16:02,156
I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,

284
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,620
but the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.

285
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,412
"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world

286
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,922
if Dylan had never been born,

287
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:17,404
I've decided that it would not have been better for me."

288
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:23,888
I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,

289
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,921
problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,

290
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:30,740
and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.

291
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,941
And then I thought, all of us who have children

292
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:36,633
love the children we have, with their flaws.

293
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,889
If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling

294
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:43,099
and offered to take away the children I have

295
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:49,693
and give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --

296
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:54,798
I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.

297
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,790
And ultimately I feel

298
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,368
that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno

299
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:04,840
to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,

300
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,908
so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences

301
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,589
reflect on the universal experience of parenting,

302
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,723
which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,

303
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,912
where did you come from?

304
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,366
(Laughter)

305
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:25,341
It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --

306
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:27,886
there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,

307
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:30,523
there are only so many families of children who are transgender,

308
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,717
there are only so many families of prodigies --

309
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:35,001
who also face similar challenges in many ways --

310
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,691
there are only so many families in each of those categories --

311
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,123
but if you start to think

312
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:42,689
that the experience of negotiating difference within your family

313
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:44,719
is what people are addressing,

314
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:48,456
then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.

315
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:53,091
Ironically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,

316
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:55,519
that unite us.

317
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,833
I decided to have children while I was working on this project.

318
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,949
And many people were astonished and said,

319
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,797
"But how can you decide to have children

320
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:09,903
in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"

321
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:13,133
And I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.

322
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,224
What I'm studying is how much love there can be,

323
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:20,949
even when everything appears to be going wrong."

324
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:26,584
I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,

325
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:30,356
a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.

326
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,166
And when his ashes were interred, his mother said,

327
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:41,200
"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,

328
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,256
once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."

329
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:51,892
And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child

330
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:54,424
if they had the effective will to do so.

331
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:59,449
So my husband is the biological father of two children

332
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,210
with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.

333
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,034
I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.

334
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:09,932
And so she and I have a daughter,

335
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,143
and mother and daughter live in Texas.

336
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:15,382
And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time

337
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,766
of whom I am the biological father,

338
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:21,686
and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,

339
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,749
the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.

340
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:33,404
(Applause)

341
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:38,868
So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.

342
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:42,224
And there are people who think that the existence of my family

343
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,889
somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.

344
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,517
And there are people who think that families like mine

345
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,201
shouldn't be allowed to exist.

346
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:57,856
And I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.

347
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,382
And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity

348
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:03,633
to ensure that the planet can go on,

349
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:07,834
so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family

350
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:12,515
in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.

351
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,885
The day after our son was born,

352
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:19,457
the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.

353
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:22,590
He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.

354
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,499
She said that might mean that he had brain damage.

355
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:28,860
In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,

356
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,723
which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.

357
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:37,506
And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.

358
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,136
And as she told me all of these things,

359
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:43,131
I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.

360
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:45,474
And I thought, here I had been working for years

361
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:48,023
on a book about how much meaning people had found

362
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:51,556
in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,

363
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:55,456
and I didn't want to join their number.

364
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,151
Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.

365
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,401
And like all parents since the dawn of time,

366
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,747
I wanted to protect my child from illness.

367
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,958
And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.

368
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,518
And yet, I knew from the work I had done

369
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,625
that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,

370
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,698
that those would ultimately be his identity,

371
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:20,932
and if they were his identity they would become my identity,

372
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:25,089
that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.

373
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,120
We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,

374
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,118
we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.

375
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,312
We felt helpless.

376
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,790
And at the end of five hours,

377
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,014
they said that his brain was completely clear

378
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:40,024
and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.

379
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,956
And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,

380
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:47,291
she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.

381
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,856
(Laughter)

382
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:58,689
But I thought how my mother was right.

383
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:02,184
I thought, the love you have for your children

384
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:05,514
is unlike any other feeling in the world,

385
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:11,678
and until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.

386
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:13,999
I think children had ensnared me

387
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,525
the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.

388
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,457
But I'm not sure I would have noticed that

389
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:24,982
if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.

390
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:28,214
I'd encountered so much strange love,

391
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,999
and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.

392
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:38,726
And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.

393
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:42,532
During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned

394
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:46,024
the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,

395
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:49,556
and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.

396
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:53,857
And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,

397
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:58,807
enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children

398
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:01,756
and trying to breed identity out of misery,

399
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:06,392
I realized that day that my research had built me a plank

400
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,806
and that I was ready to join them on their ship.

401
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,623
Thank you.

402
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:17,274
(Applause)
