1
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,264
If I should have a daughter,

2
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:17,399
instead of "Mom,"

3
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:20,724
she's going to call me "Point B,"

4
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,375
because that way she knows
that no matter what happens,

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,796
at least she can always find
her way to me.

6
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:29,740
And I'm going to paint solar systems
on the backs of her hands

7
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,702
so she has to learn the entire universe

8
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:34,820
before she can say, "Oh, I know that
like the back of my hand."

9
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:36,796
And she's going to learn

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,796
that this life will hit you
hard in the face,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,115
wait for you to get back up just
so it can kick you in the stomach.

12
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:45,051
But getting the wind knocked out of you

13
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,921
is the only way to remind your lungs

14
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,796
how much they like the taste of air.

15
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,096
There is hurt, here,

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,460
that cannot be fixed
by Band-Aids or poetry.

17
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:56,796
So the first time she realizes
that Wonder Woman isn't coming,

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,334
I'll make sure she knows

19
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,757
she doesn't have to wear
the cape all by herself,

20
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,271
because no matter how wide
you stretch your fingers,

21
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:04,970
your hands will always be too small

22
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:07,511
to catch all the pain you want to heal.

23
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,514
Believe me, I've tried.

24
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:10,833
"And, baby," I'll tell her,

25
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:12,975
don't keep your nose up
in the air like that.

26
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,273
I know that trick;
I've done it a million times.

27
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,796
You're just smelling for smoke

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,796
so you can follow the trail
back to a burning house,

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,439
so you can find the boy
who lost everything in the fire

30
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,795
to see if you can save him.

31
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:27,796
Or else find the boy who lit
the fire in the first place,

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,297
to see if you can change him.

33
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:31,796
But I know she will anyway,

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,868
so instead I'll always keep
an extra supply

35
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:36,010
of chocolate and rain boots nearby,

36
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,923
because there is no heartbreak
that chocolate can't fix.

37
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:42,121
Okay, there's a few
that chocolate can't fix.

38
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,383
But that's what the rain boots are for,

39
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,796
because rain will wash away
everything, if you let it.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,796
I want her to look at the world

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,402
through the underside
of a glass-bottom boat,

42
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:53,796
to look through a microscope

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,796
at the galaxies that exist

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,995
on the pinpoint of a human mind,

45
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,027
because that's the way my mom taught me.

46
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,796
That there'll be days like this.

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,796
(Singing) There'll be days
like this, my momma said.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,796
When you open your hands to catch

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,367
and wind up with only
blisters and bruises;

50
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,796
when you step out of the phone
booth and try to fly

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,697
and the very people you want to save

52
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:15,460
are the ones standing on your cape;

53
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,388
when your boots will fill with rain,

54
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:19,796
and you'll be up to your knees
in disappointment.

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,322
And those are the very days you have
all the more reason to say thank you.

56
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:25,201
Because there's nothing more beautiful

57
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:28,086
than the way the ocean refuses
to stop kissing the shoreline,

58
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,352
no matter how many times it's sent away.

59
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:34,407
You will put the wind
in win some, lose some.

60
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,796
You will put the star
in starting over, and over.

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,796
And no matter how many land
mines erupt in a minute,

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,446
be sure your mind lands

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,827
on the beauty of this
funny place called life.

64
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,613
And yes, on a scale
from one to over-trusting,

65
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,796
I am pretty damn naive.

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,319
But I want her to know
that this world is made out of sugar.

67
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,796
It can crumble so easily,

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,796
but don't be afraid to stick
your tongue out and taste it.

69
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,796
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember,
your momma is a worrier,

70
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,654
and your poppa is a warrior,

71
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:05,040
and you are the girl
with small hands and big eyes

72
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:06,796
who never stops asking for more."

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,399
Remember that good things come in threes

74
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,842
and so do bad things.

75
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:14,208
Always apologize when
you've done something wrong,

76
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:15,613
but don't you ever apologize

77
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:17,796
for the way your eyes
refuse to stop shining.

78
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,796
Your voice is small,
but don't ever stop singing.

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,796
And when they finally hand you heartache,

80
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,796
when they slip war
and hatred under your door

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,796
and offer you handouts on street-corners

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,796
of cynicism and defeat,

83
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,948
you tell them that they really
ought to meet your mother.

84
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,391
(Applause)

85
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,796
Thank you. Thank you.

86
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,145
(Applause)

87
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,533
Thank you.

88
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,716
(Applause)

89
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,829
Thanks.

90
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,001
(Applause)

91
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:53,296
Thank you.

92
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,796
(Applause)

93
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,796
All right, so I want you to take a moment,

94
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,796
and I want you to think of three things
that you know to be true.

95
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,796
They can be about whatever you want --

96
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,378
technology, entertainment, design,

97
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,331
your family, what you had for breakfast.

98
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,323
The only rule is don't think too hard.

99
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,820
Okay, ready? Go.

100
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,550
Okay.

101
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:25,154
So here are three things
I know to be true.

102
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,209
I know that Jean-Luc Godard
was right when he said that,

103
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,257
"A good story has a beginning,
a middle and an end,

104
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:33,568
although not necessarily in that order."

105
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,796
I know that I'm incredibly nervous
and excited to be up here,

106
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,821
which is greatly inhibiting
my ability to keep it cool.

107
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,178
(Laughter)

108
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,796
And I know

109
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,544
that I have been waiting
all week to tell this joke.

110
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:47,712
(Laughter)

111
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,910
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?

112
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,101
Because he was out standing in his field.

113
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,593
(Laughter)

114
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,932
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,221
Okay, so these are three things
I know to be true.

116
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,428
But there are plenty of things
I have trouble understanding.

117
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:08,348
So I write poems to figure things out.

118
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,630
Sometimes the only way I know
how to work through something

119
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,107
is by writing a poem.

120
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,029
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,

121
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,580
look back and go,
"Oh, that's what this is all about,"

122
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,621
and sometimes I get to the end of the poem

123
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:20,980
and haven't solved anything,

124
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,178
but at least I have a new poem out of it.

125
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:25,901
Spoken-word poetry is the art
of performance poetry.

126
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,372
I tell people it involves creating poetry

127
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,284
that doesn't just want to sit on paper,

128
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:33,117
that something about it
demands it be heard out loud

129
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:34,514
or witnessed in person.

130
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,974
When I was a freshman in high school,

131
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:40,796
I was a live wire of nervous hormones.

132
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:44,796
And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,796
And despite my fear

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,986
of ever being looked at for too long,

135
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,231
I was fascinated by the idea
of spoken-word poetry.

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,895
I felt that my two secret loves,
poetry and theater,

137
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,848
had come together, had a baby,

138
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,537
a baby I needed to get to know.

139
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,506
So I decided to give it a try.

140
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,434
My first spoken-word poem,

141
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,796
packed with all the wisdom
of a 14-year-old,

142
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,796
was about the injustice

143
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,386
of being seen as unfeminine.

144
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:14,680
The poem was very indignant,

145
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:15,846
and mainly exaggerated,

146
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,098
but the only spoken-word poetry
that I had seen up until that point

147
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,796
was mainly indignant,

148
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,154
so I thought
that's what was expected of me.

149
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,796
The first time that I performed,

150
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,309
the audience of teenagers hooted
and hollered their sympathy,

151
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,796
and when I came off the stage,
I was shaking.

152
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,707
I felt this tap on my shoulder,

153
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,287
and I turned around to see

154
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,222
this giant girl in a hoodie
sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.

155
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,661
She was maybe eight feet tall

156
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,143
and looked like she could
beat me up with one hand,

157
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,244
but instead she just nodded
at me and said,

158
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,033
"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."

159
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,501
And lightning struck.

160
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,065
I was hooked.

161
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,559
I discovered this bar
on Manhattan's Lower East Side

162
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,796
that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,

163
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,796
and my bewildered,
but supportive, parents took me

164
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,796
to soak in every ounce
of spoken word that I could.

165
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,796
I was the youngest by at least a decade,

166
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,796
but somehow the poets
at the Bowery Poetry Club

167
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,041
didn't seem bothered
by the 14-year-old wandering about.

168
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,590
In fact, they welcomed me.

169
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,551
And it was here, listening to these poets
share their stories,

170
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:18,758
that I learned that spoken-word
poetry didn't have to be indignant,

171
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,102
it could be fun or painful

172
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,062
or serious or silly.

173
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,340
The Bowery Poetry Club became
my classroom and my home,

174
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,000
and the poets who performed

175
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,404
encouraged me to share my stories as well.

176
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,317
Never mind the fact that I was 14.

177
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,796
They told me, "Write about being 14."

178
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,539
So I did and stood amazed every week

179
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:39,796
when these brilliant, grown-up poets

180
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,821
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

181
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:45,148
and clapped and told me,
"Hey, I really felt that too."

182
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:49,223
Now I can divide my spoken-word journey

183
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,796
into three steps.

184
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,637
Step one was the moment I said,

185
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,796
"I can. I can do this."

186
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,007
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.

187
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,086
Step two was the moment I said,

188
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,194
"I will. I will continue.

189
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:04,182
I love spoken word. I will keep
coming back week after week."

190
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,796
And step three began

191
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,620
when I realized I didn't have
to write indignant poems,

192
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,042
if that's not what I was.

193
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,231
There were things
that were specific to me,

194
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,796
and the more that I focused
on those things,

195
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,796
the weirder my poetry got,

196
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,796
but the more that it felt like mine.

197
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,518
It's not just the adage
"Write what you know."

198
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,367
It's about gathering up
all of the knowledge and experience

199
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:27,002
you've collected up to now

200
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,765
to help you dive into the things
you don't know.

201
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,672
I use poetry to help me work
through what I don't understand,

202
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,641
but I show up to each new poem

203
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:37,796
with a backpack full
of everywhere else that I've been.

204
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,011
When I got to university,
I met a fellow poet

205
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:44,527
who shared my belief in the magic
of spoken-word poetry.

206
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,545
And actually, Phil Kaye and I

207
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,162
coincidentally also share
the same last name.

208
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,921
When I was in high school I had
created Project V.O.I.C.E.

209
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,796
as a way to encourage my friends
to do spoken word with me.

210
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,796
But Phil and I decided to reinvent
Project V.O.I.C.E.,

211
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,796
this time changing the mission

212
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,796
to using spoken-word poetry
as a way to entertain,

213
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,796
educate and inspire.

214
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,535
We stayed full-time students,
but in between we traveled,

215
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,387
performing and teaching

216
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:11,795
nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,

217
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,165
from California to Indiana to India

218
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,796
to a public high school
just up the street from campus.

219
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,797
And we saw over and over

220
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,796
the way that spoken-word poetry

221
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,235
cracks open locks.

222
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:28,040
But it turns out sometimes,
poetry can be really scary.

223
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,135
Turns out sometimes,

224
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,796
you have to trick teenagers
into writing poetry.

225
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,285
So I came up with lists.
Everyone can write lists.

226
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,335
And the first list that I assign

227
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,039
is "10 Things I Know to be True."

228
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,998
And here's what happens,
you would discover it too

229
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,141
if we all started sharing
our lists out loud.

230
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:51,495
At a certain point, you would realize
that someone has the exact same thing,

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,496
or one thing very similar,

232
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,796
to something on your list.

233
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,796
And then someone else

234
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,390
has something the complete
opposite of yours.

235
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Third, someone has something
you've never even heard of before.

236
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:06,289
Fourth, someone has something
you thought you knew everything about,

237
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,796
but they're introducing
a new angle of looking at it.

238
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,868
And I tell people that this is
where great stories start from --

239
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:14,020
these four intersections

240
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,796
of what you're passionate about

241
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,203
and what others might be invested in.

242
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,796
And most people respond
really well to this exercise.

243
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,941
But one of my students,
a freshman named Charlotte,

244
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,425
was not convinced.

245
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:29,487
Charlotte was very good at writing lists,
but she refused to write any poems.

246
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,799
"Miss," she'd say,
"I'm just not interesting.

247
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:34,250
I don't have anything interesting to say."

248
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,796
So I assigned her list after list,

249
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,471
and one day I assigned the list

250
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,471
"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."

251
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:43,023
Number three on Charlotte's list was,

252
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,064
"I should have learned
not to crush on guys

253
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:46,563
three times my age."

254
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,888
I asked her what that meant,

255
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:51,350
and she said, "Miss,
it's kind of a long story."

256
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:54,198
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds
pretty interesting to me."

257
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:55,976
And so she wrote her first poem,

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,577
a love poem unlike any
I had ever heard before.

259
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:02,022
And the poem began,

260
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,164
"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."

261
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:06,657
(Laughter)

262
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,298
"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,

263
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,102
racing Michael Phelps in a pool --

264
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:11,796
nothing but swim trunks on --

265
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,952
diving in the water, determined
to beat this swimming champion?

266
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,365
After the race, he tossed
his wet, cloud-white hair

267
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,648
and said, 'You're a god.'

268
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,796
No, Anderson, you're the god."

269
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,796
(Laughter)

270
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,693
(Applause)

271
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,612
Now, I know that the number one
rule to being cool

272
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,523
is to seem unfazed,

273
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:35,743
to never admit that anything scares you

274
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,376
or impresses you or excites you.

275
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,796
Somebody once told me

276
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,969
it's like walking through life like this.

277
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,367
You protect yourself

278
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:45,629
from all the unexpected miseries
or hurt that might show up.

279
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,283
But I try to walk through life like this.

280
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,174
And yes, that means catching
all of those miseries and hurt,

281
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:54,924
but it also means
that when beautiful, amazing things

282
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,365
just fall out of the sky,

283
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,796
I'm ready to catch them.

284
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,201
I use spoken word to help my students

285
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,796
rediscover wonder,

286
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,586
to fight their instincts
to be cool and unfazed

287
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,125
and, instead, actively pursue being
engaged with what goes on around them,

288
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,442
so that they can reinterpret
and create something from it.

289
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,759
It's not that I think
that spoken-word poetry

290
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,259
is the ideal art form.

291
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,418
I'm always trying to find
the best way to tell each story.

292
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:21,467
I write musicals; I make short films
alongside my poems.

293
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,665
But I teach spoken-word poetry

294
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,634
because it's accessible.

295
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:29,106
Not everyone can read music
or owns a camera,

296
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,495
but everyone can communicate in some way,

297
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,296
and everyone has stories
that the rest of us can learn from.

298
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,552
Plus, spoken-word poetry allows
for immediate connection.

299
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,771
It's not uncommon
to feel like you're alone

300
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,388
or that nobody understands you,

301
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,796
but spoken word teaches

302
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,551
that if you have the ability
to express yourself

303
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:49,392
and the courage to present
those stories and opinions,

304
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,796
you could be rewarded

305
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,796
with a room full of your peers,

306
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,106
or your community, who will listen.

307
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,425
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie

308
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,495
who will connect with what you've shared.

309
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,796
And that is an amazing
realization to have,

310
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,666
especially when you're 14.

311
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,796
Plus, now with YouTube,

312
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,462
that connection's not even limited
to the room we're in.

313
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,708
I'm so lucky that there's
this archive of performances

314
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,396
that I can share with my students.

315
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,865
It allows for even more opportunities

316
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,292
for them to find a poet or a poem
that they connect to.

317
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,154
Once you've figured this out,

318
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,321
it is tempting to keep
writing the same poem,

319
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,528
or keep telling the same story,
over and over,

320
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,131
once you've figured out
that it will gain you applause.

321
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:32,138
It's not enough to just teach
that you can express yourself.

322
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,796
You have to grow and explore

323
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,117
and take risks and challenge yourself.

324
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:38,796
And that is step three:

325
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,796
infusing the work you're doing

326
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,868
with the specific things
that make you you,

327
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,222
even while those things
are always changing.

328
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,960
Because step three never ends.

329
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,373
But you don't get to start on step three,

330
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,561
until you take step one first:

331
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:53,598
"I can."

332
00:13:53,622 --> 00:13:55,344
I travel a lot while I'm teaching,

333
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,870
and I don't always get to watch
all of my students reach their step three,

334
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:00,612
but I was very lucky with Charlotte,

335
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:03,276
that I got to watch her journey
unfold the way it did.

336
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,632
I watched her realize

337
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:08,432
that, by putting the things that she knows
to be true into the work she's doing,

338
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,896
she can create poems
that only Charlotte can write,

339
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,859
about eyeballs and elevators
and Dora the Explorer.

340
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,573
And I'm trying to tell
stories only I can tell --

341
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:17,796
like this story.

342
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,084
I spent a lot of time thinking
about the best way to tell this story,

343
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:22,550
and I wondered if the best way

344
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,677
was going to be
a PowerPoint, a short film --

345
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,478
And where exactly was the beginning,
the middle or the end?

346
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,875
I wondered whether I'd get
to the end of this talk

347
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,453
and finally have
figured it all out, or not.

348
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,392
And I always thought that my beginning
was at the Bowery Poetry Club,

349
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,492
but it's possible
that it was much earlier.

350
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:39,796
In preparing for TED,

351
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,059
I discovered this diary page
in an old journal.

352
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,265
I think December 54th
was probably supposed to be 24th.

353
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,796
It's clear that when I was a child,

354
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,073
I definitely walked
through life like this.

355
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,407
I think that we all did.

356
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,796
I would like to help others
rediscover that wonder --

357
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,285
to want to engage with it,
to want to learn,

358
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,196
to want to share what they've learned,

359
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,896
what they've figured out to be true

360
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,896
and what they're still figuring out.

361
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,082
So I'd like to close with this poem.

362
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,207
When they bombed Hiroshima,

363
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:12,286
the explosion formed a mini-supernova,

364
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,364
so every living animal, human or plant

365
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:19,066
that received direct contact
with the rays from that sun

366
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,686
was instantly turned to ash.

367
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:23,061
And what was left
of the city soon followed.

368
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,489
The long-lasting damage
of nuclear radiation

369
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,430
caused an entire city and its population

370
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,298
to turn into powder.

371
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:34,579
When I was born, my mom says
I looked around the whole hospital room

372
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:37,796
with a stare that said,
"This? I've done this before."

373
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,898
She says I have old eyes.

374
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,796
When my Grandpa Genji died,
I was only five years old,

375
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,969
but I took my mom
by the hand and told her,

376
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:47,533
"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."

377
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:51,268
And yet, for someone
who's apparently done this already,

378
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,796
I still haven't figured anything out yet.

379
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,796
My knees still buckle
every time I get on a stage.

380
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,796
My self-confidence can be measured out

381
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,796
in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,

382
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,796
and it still always
tastes funny in my mouth.

383
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:07,343
But in Hiroshima, some people
were wiped clean away,

384
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,121
leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.

385
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,577
So no matter that I have inhibitions
to fill all my pockets,

386
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:14,796
I keep trying,

387
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,796
hoping that one day I'll write a poem

388
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,963
I can be proud to let sit
in a museum exhibit

389
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:21,224
as the only proof I existed.

390
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:24,796
My parents named me Sarah,
which is a biblical name.

391
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,177
In the original story, God told Sarah
she could do something impossible, and --

392
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:30,899
she laughed,

393
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,500
because the first Sarah,

394
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,868
she didn't know what to do
with impossible.

395
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,092
And me?

396
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:37,796
Well, neither do I,

397
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,796
but I see the impossible every day.

398
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,725
Impossible is trying
to connect in this world,

399
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:45,853
trying to hold onto others while things
are blowing up around you,

400
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:47,553
knowing that while you're speaking,

401
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:50,635
they aren't just waiting for their turn
to talk -- they hear you.

402
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,150
They feel exactly what you feel

403
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:53,796
at the same time that you feel it.

404
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,297
It's what I strive for every time
I open my mouth --

405
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,401
that impossible connection.

406
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,796
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima

407
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,562
that was completely burnt
black by the radiation.

408
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,260
But on the front step,
a person who was sitting there

409
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,554
blocked the rays from hitting the stone.

410
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:09,796
The only thing left now

411
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,328
is a permanent shadow of positive light.

412
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,796
After the A-bomb,

413
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,408
specialists said it would take 75 years

414
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,796
for the radiation-damaged
soil of Hiroshima City

415
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,796
to ever grow anything again.

416
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,185
But that spring, there were
new buds popping up from the earth.

417
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,212
When I meet you, in that moment,

418
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,072
I'm no longer a part of your future.

419
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,335
I start quickly becoming
part of your past.

420
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,796
But in that instant,
I get to share your present.

421
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,796
And you, you get to share mine.

422
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,796
And that is the greatest present of all.

423
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,082
So if you tell me
I can do the impossible --

424
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:41,208
I'll probably laugh at you.

425
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't know if I can change
the world yet,

426
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:45,363
because I don't know that much about it --

427
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,977
and I don't know that much
about reincarnation either,

428
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,845
but if you make me laugh hard enough,

429
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,097
sometimes I forget what century I'm in.

430
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,580
This isn't my first time here.
This isn't my last time here.

431
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,516
These aren't the last words I'll share.

432
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,796
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest

433
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,231
to get it right this time around.

434
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:03,819
Thank you.

435
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,673
(Applause)

436
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,729
Thank you.

437
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,986
(Applause)

438
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,157
Thank you.

439
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:14,018
(Applause)

440
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,162
Thank you.

441
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,510
(Applause)
