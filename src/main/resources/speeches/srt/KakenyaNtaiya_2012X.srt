1
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:16,901
There's a group of people in Kenya.

2
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:20,905
People cross oceans to go see them.

3
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,939
These people are tall.

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,446
They jump high. They wear red.

5
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,558
And they kill lions.

6
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:32,615
You might be wondering, who are these people?

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,209
These are the Maasais.

8
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:41,111
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.

9
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:45,471
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.

10
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:48,718
The girls are brought up to be mothers.

11
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:51,246
When I was five years old,

12
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:53,814
I found out that I was engaged

13
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:56,900
to be married as soon as I reached puberty.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,886
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties,

15
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,064
they constantly reminded me that

16
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,784
your husband just passed by.

17
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:09,730
(Laughter) Cool, yeah?

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,895
And everything I had to do from that moment

19
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:17,526
was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.

20
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:21,103
My day started at 5 in the morning,

21
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,260
milking the cows, sweeping the house,

22
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,799
cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,041
I did everything that I needed to do

24
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,668
to become a perfect wife.

25
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,732
I went to school not because the Maasais'

26
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:40,373
women or girls were going to school.

27
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,530
It's because my mother was denied an education,

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,999
and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that

29
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,947
she never wanted us to live the life she was living.

30
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,476
Why did she say that?

31
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:56,804
My father worked as a policeman in the city.

32
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,434
He came home once a year.

33
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:01,791
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.

34
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,679
And whenever he came home, it was a different case.

35
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,684
My mother worked hard in the farm

36
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:09,550
to grow crops so that we can eat.

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,653
She reared the cows and the goats

38
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,668
so that she can care for us.

39
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:16,498
But when my father came, he would sell the cows,

40
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:18,881
he would sell the products we had,

41
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:23,076
and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.

42
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,469
Because my mother was a woman,

43
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:27,470
she was not allowed to own any property,

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,964
and by default, everything in my family anyway

45
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:32,636
belongs to my father, so he had the right.

46
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,925
And if my mother ever questioned him,

47
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:41,713
he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.

48
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:44,719
When I went to school, I had a dream.

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,124
I wanted to become a teacher.

50
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,930
Teachers looked nice.

51
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,183
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.

52
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:54,286
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.

53
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:57,541
(Laughter)

54
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,042
But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board --

55
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:04,116
not hard work, that's what I thought,

56
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,996
compared to what I was doing in the farm.

57
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,943
So I wanted to become a teacher.

58
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:12,846
I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,

59
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:15,250
it was a determining factor.

60
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,823
In our tradition, there is a ceremony

61
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,656
that girls have to undergo to become women,

62
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:23,237
and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.

63
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,805
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade,

64
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,356
and that was a transition for me to go to high school.

65
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,937
This was the crossroad.

66
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:36,459
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.

67
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,701
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.

68
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:43,216
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan

69
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,780
to figure these things out.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,916
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.

71
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,116
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony

72
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,696
if you let me go back to school."

73
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,284
The reason why, if I ran away,

74
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:01,730
my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him

75
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,771
the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.

76
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:08,790
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.

77
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,642
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,

78
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:14,975
you'll go to school after the ceremony."

79
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:17,595
I did. The ceremony happened.

80
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:21,176
It's a whole week long of excitement.

81
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,341
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.

82
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,309
And the day before the actual ceremony happens,

83
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,797
we were dancing, having excitement,

84
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:32,720
and through all the night we did not sleep.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,050
The actual day came, and we walked out of the house

86
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,204
that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.

87
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:42,073
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.

88
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,684
They were all in a circle.

89
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,343
And as we danced and danced,

90
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:49,188
and we approached this circle of women,

91
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,339
men, women, children, everybody was there.

92
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,907
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it,

93
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:59,445
and this woman was waiting to hold us.

94
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:03,120
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,114
and as I approached her,

96
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:08,833
she looked at me, and I sat down.

97
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,411
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.

98
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,879
As I opened my leg, another woman came,

99
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,235
and this woman was carrying a knife.

100
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,819
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me

101
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,208
and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.

102
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:32,471
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.

103
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:37,569
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.

104
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,692
It's something that so many girls --

105
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:43,590
I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.

106
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,001
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,

107
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,802
and it was difficult.

108
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,539
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something

109
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,536
that most women don't do.

110
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:01,363
Three days later, after everybody has left the home,

111
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:03,085
my mom went and brought a nurse.

112
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:04,939
We were taken care of.

113
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,532
Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.

114
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:13,003
I was so determined to be a teacher now

115
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:17,003
so that I could make a difference in my family.

116
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,770
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.

117
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,384
I met a young gentleman from our village

118
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,617
who had been to the University of Oregon.

119
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:31,493
This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,

120
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:34,789
white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.

121
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,716
There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.

122
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:42,179
They were sneakers, and this is in a village

123
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:46,249
that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.

124
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:51,236
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"

125
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:55,484
because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.

126
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,749
And he told me, "Well,

127
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,883
what do you mean, you want to go?

128
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,203
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"

129
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:04,008
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.

130
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:07,166
Just tell me how to get there."

131
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,768
This gentleman, he helped me.

132
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,615
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.

133
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,883
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,

134
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:19,203
so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.

135
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:22,894
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.

136
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:26,339
Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,

137
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,983
is my father by default --

138
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:32,166
my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.

139
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,299
So the news came, I applied to school

140
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:39,531
and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,

141
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,971
and I couldn't come without the support of the village,

142
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,963
because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.

143
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:49,243
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.

144
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,931
But I needed the support of the village,

145
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,513
and here again, when the men heard,

146
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:59,590
and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,

147
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,015
they said, "What a lost opportunity.

148
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,660
This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."

149
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,987
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.

150
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,305
There's a belief among our people

151
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:15,675
that morning brings good news.

152
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:18,537
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning,

153
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,939
because there's good news in the morning.

154
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,143
And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,

155
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:28,795
who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.

156
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,450
So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.

157
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,211
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.

158
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,760
"My child, what are you doing here?"

159
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,035
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"

160
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:45,267
I promised him that I would be the best girl,

161
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:48,501
I will come back, anything they wanted after that,

162
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,660
I will do it for them.

163
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,754
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."

164
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:56,301
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went --

165
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,838
16 more men -- every single morning

166
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,422
I went and visited them.

167
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,163
They all came together.

168
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:05,153
The village, the women, the men, everybody came together

169
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:08,472
to support me to come to get an education.

170
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:13,235
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?

171
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:16,444
I found snow!

172
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:19,602
I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,

173
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,678
and lots of food in the cafeteria.

174
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:25,331
I was in a land of plenty.

175
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:31,096
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,

176
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,728
I discovered a lot of things.

177
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,769
I learned that that ceremony that I went through

178
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,964
when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.

179
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:45,638
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.

180
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:49,590
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body

181
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,668
to get an education. I had a right.

182
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:57,107
And as we speak right now, three million girls

183
00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:02,448
in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.

184
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:05,623
I learned that my mom had a right to own property.

185
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:08,512
I learned that she did not have to be abused

186
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,955
because she is a woman.

187
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:14,042
Those things made me angry.

188
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,943
I wanted to do something.

189
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,512
As I went back, every time I went,

190
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:21,480
I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.

191
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,554
They were getting mutilated, and here,

192
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,090
after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,

193
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,613
I went back to school to get my graduate work,

194
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:33,723
the constant cry of these girls was in my face.

195
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:36,549
I had to do something.

196
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,469
As I went back, I started talking to the men,

197
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,056
to the village, and mothers, and I said,

198
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:43,076
"I want to give back the way I had promised you

199
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,788
that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"

200
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,906
As I spoke to the women, they told me,

201
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,882
"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."

202
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,638
Because there had not been any school for girls.

203
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,451
And the reason they wanted the school for girls

204
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:58,077
is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,

205
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,285
the mother is blamed for that.

206
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,697
If she got pregnant before she got married,

207
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,066
the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.

208
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,707
She's beaten.

209
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:11,442
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."

210
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,085
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,

211
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,458
the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:

212
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,861
"We want a school for boys."

213
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:22,165
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village

214
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,837
who have been out and they have gotten an education.

215
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:26,909
Why can't they build a school for boys,

216
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:29,206
and I'll build a school for girls?"

217
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:32,481
That made sense. And they agreed.

218
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:37,140
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.

219
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,932
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.

220
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,391
We have.

221
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:46,523
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.

222
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:49,163
Angeline came to apply for the school,

223
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:52,763
and she did not meet any criteria that we had.

224
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:55,506
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.

225
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,250
But she was older. She was 12 years old,

226
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,362
and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.

227
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,157
Angeline had been moving from one place --

228
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:05,498
because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father --

229
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:07,852
moving from one grandmother's house to another one,

230
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,486
from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.

231
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,074
And I looked at her, I remember that day,

232
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:18,606
and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.

233
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,502
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.

234
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:24,472
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.

235
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:27,699
Five months later, that is Angeline.

236
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:30,465
A transformation had begun in her life.

237
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:33,207
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world

238
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,940
and make a difference.

239
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,740
She was not the top student when we took her.

240
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,236
Now she's the best student, not just in our school,

241
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:42,385
but in the entire division that we are in.

242
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:46,706
That's Sharon. That's five years later.

243
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:53,875
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.

244
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,150
As a new dawn is happening in my school,

245
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,409
a new beginning is happening.

246
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:04,753
As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.

247
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:09,449
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.

248
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:15,417
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.

249
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,690
This is the thing that we are doing,

250
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,017
giving them opportunities where they can rise.

251
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:24,672
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten

252
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,218
because of the revolutions we've started in our community.

253
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:35,898
(Applause)

254
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,733
I want to challenge you today.

255
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,637
You are listening to me because you are here,

256
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:44,081
very optimistic.

257
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:47,595
You are somebody who is so passionate.

258
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:51,442
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.

259
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,948
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.

260
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,697
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.

261
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:02,263
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.

262
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:06,041
I want to challenge you today that to be the first,

263
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,538
because people will follow you.

264
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,762
Be the first. People will follow you.

265
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:16,045
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.

266
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:19,325
Move out, because as you change your world,

267
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,764
as you change your community,

268
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:26,564
as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,

269
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,884
one village, one country at a time.

270
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:32,749
We are making a difference, so if you change your world,

271
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,798
you are going to change your community,

272
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,590
you are going to change your country,

273
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,557
and think about that. If you do that, and I do that,

274
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:43,157
aren't we going to create a better future for our children,

275
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:45,392
for your children, for our grandchildren?

276
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:49,597
And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

277
00:14:49,597 --> 00:15:06,749
(Applause)
