1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,330
I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see

2
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,330
a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,330
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater,

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,330
and really I must thank Herbie Hancock

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,330
and his colleagues for such a great presentation. (Applause)

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,330
One of the interesting things,

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,330
of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:50,330
and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people.

9
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,330
Of course, my job is all about listening,

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,330
and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,330
That's my only real aim in life.

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,330
And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.

13
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,330
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example,

14
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:25,330
if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully,

15
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,330
a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.

16
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:39,330
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music.

17
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,330
So technically, I can actually read this.

18
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,330
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,330
I will do exactly as I'm told.

20
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,330
And so therefore, because time is short,

21
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:05,330
if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward.

22
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,330
There's nothing too difficult about the piece.

23
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,330
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,330
I'm being told where to play on the drum.

25
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,330
I'm being told which part of the stick to use.

26
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,330
And I'm being told the dynamic.

27
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,330
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.

28
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,330
Snares on, snares off.

29
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:38,330
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea. (Music)

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,330
And so on. My career would probably last about five years.

31
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:22,330
However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.

32
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,330
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher,

33
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,330
or to talk about, even, from a teacher.

34
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,330
But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument

35
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,330
that in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explore

36
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,330
through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.

37
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,330
So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation. (Music) (Applause)

38
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,330
Now my career may last a little longer!

39
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,330
But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see

40
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,330
a nice bright young lady with a pink top on.

41
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,330
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.

42
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,330
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like,

43
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,330
what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.

44
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,330
However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get

45
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,330
when we actually look, and we try to interpret,

46
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,330
but actually it's so unbelievably shallow.

47
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,330
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea;

48
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,330
I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.

49
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,330
Just the basic feeling.

50
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,330
However, that is simply not enough.

51
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,330
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen.

52
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,330
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.

53
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:51,330
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick --

54
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,330
you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.

55
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,330
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not --

56
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,330
detached from the instrument and from the stick,

57
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,330
even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.

58
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,330
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.

59
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,330
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system,

60
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:26,330
suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more.

61
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,330
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum.

62
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,330
And I'm doing far, far less.

63
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,330
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument,

64
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,330
I need time with people in order to interpret them.

65
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,330
Not just translate them, but interpret them.

66
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:52,330
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music

67
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,330
for which I think of myself as a technician --

68
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,330
that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ... (Music)

69
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,330
And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ... (Music)

70
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:47,330
And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause)

71
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,330
-- thinking about.

72
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,330
And I remember when I was 12 years old,

73
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,330
and I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said,

74
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,330
"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."

75
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,330
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what's the problem?"

76
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,330
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"

77
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,330
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"

78
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,330
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."

79
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,330
And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands,

80
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:31,330
through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."

81
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,330
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums --

82
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,330
in particular, the kettle drums, or tympani --

83
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:49,330
to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like ...

84
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:56,330
that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ...

85
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,330
and it's amazing that when you do open your body up,

86
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,330
and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,

87
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,330
that in fact the tiny, tiny difference ...

88
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,330
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.

89
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,330
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall

90
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:26,330
of the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments,

91
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,330
and really try to connect with those sounds

92
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,330
far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.

93
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,330
Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.

94
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,330
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument,

95
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:53,330
the type of sticks ... etc., etc.

96
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:01,330
They're all different.

97
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,330
Same amount of weight, but different sound colors.

98
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,330
And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings,

99
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,330
but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were,

100
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,330
that make up these extraordinary personalities

101
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,330
and characters and interests and things.

102
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,330
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London,

103
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,330
and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue,

104
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,330
you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician."

105
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,330
And I just couldn't quite accept that.

106
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:43,330
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse --

107
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,330
if you refuse me through those reasons,

108
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:55,330
as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love

109
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,330
the art of creating sound --

110
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:04,330
then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."

111
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,330
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice --

112
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,330
they accepted me. And not only that --

113
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,330
what had happened was that it changed the whole role

114
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,330
of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.

115
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:31,330
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of

116
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,330
whether someone had no arms, no legs --

117
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,330
they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.

118
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:44,330
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.

119
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,330
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then

120
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:57,330
based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.

121
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,330
So therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting

122
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,330
bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions.

123
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,330
And I have to say, many of them now

124
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,330
in the professional orchestras throughout the world.

125
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,330
The interesting thing about this as well, though --

126
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,330
(Applause) --

127
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,330
is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound --

128
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,330
which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.

129
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,330
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound."

130
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,330
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced

131
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,330
as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad

132
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,330
who has got the most incredible challenges,

133
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,330
who may not be able to control his movements,

134
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,330
who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. --

135
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:02,330
suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,

136
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,330
and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,

137
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:11,330
and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --

138
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,330
I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps --

139
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,330
but something like this. Let me change. (Music)

140
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,330
Something that's so unbelievably simple --

141
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,330
but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be,

142
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
because I'm on top of the sound.

143
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,330
I have the sound coming this way.

144
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,330
He would have the sound coming through the resonators.

145
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:33,330
If there were no resonators on here, we would have ... (Music)

146
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,330
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows

147
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,330
wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either.

148
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,330
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting,

149
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,330
will experience this sound quite, quite differently.

150
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,330
And of course, being the participator of the sound,

151
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:57,330
and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce --

152
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,330
for example, this sound.

153
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,330
Can you hear anything?

154
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,330
Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it.

155
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,330
But yet, we get the sensation of something happening.

156
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,330
In the same way that when I see tree moves,

157
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,330
then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.

158
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,330
Do you see what I mean?

159
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,330
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.

160
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,330
So there's always, always that huge --

161
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,330
I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.

162
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,330
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience,

163
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,330
and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it,

164
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,330
buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth.

165
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,330
Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic,

166
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,330
and something that I can fully experience the journey of.

167
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:15,330
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. (Music)

168
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,330
It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that

169
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,330
at all and so therefore, my level of soft,

170
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,330
gentle playing may have to be ... (Music)

171
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:05,330
Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound,

172
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,330
especially through the deaf community,

173
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,330
this has not only affected how music institutions,

174
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:18,330
how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy --

175
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,330
although of course, being a participator of music,

176
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,330
that definitely is the case as well.

177
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:31,330
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls

178
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,330
they put together. There are so few halls in this world

179
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,330
that actually have very good acoustics,

180
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,330
dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.

181
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,330
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad,

182
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,330
so huge, so incredible! There's always something --

183
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,330
it may sound good up there, may not be so good there.

184
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
May be great there, but terrible up there.

185
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,330
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.

186
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,330
So to find an actual hall is incredible

187
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,330
-- for which you can play exactly what you imagine,

188
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,330
without it being cosmetically enhanced.

189
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:23,330
And so therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are

190
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,330
hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound.

191
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,330
And this is quite interesting.

192
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:37,330
I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening

193
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,330
with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people

194
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,330
for whom so many years we've been saying,

195
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,330
"Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf."

196
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,330
We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about.

197
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,330
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.

198
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,330
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.

199
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:08,330
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.

200
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,330
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps.

201
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,330
In another year's time, three extra steps.

202
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,330
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.

203
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,330
So when we do listen to each other,

204
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:32,330
it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills,

205
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,330
to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment.

206
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,330
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music,

207
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,330
it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.

208
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,330
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on.

209
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,330
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.

210
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,330
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music,

211
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,330
but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.

212
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,330
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician,

213
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,330
is that it is so unbelievably fluid.

214
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,330
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.

215
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,330
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.

216
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,330
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."

217
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,330
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.

218
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,330
Now, I don't mean just the sound;

219
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,330
I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.

220
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,330
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try.

221
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:48,330
(Applause)

222
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:58,330
Very good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow?

223
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,330
Audience: No.

224
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:05,330
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. (Laughter) Try again.

225
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,330
Try again. Snow.

226
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,330
See, you're awake.

227
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:22,330
Rain. Not bad. Not bad.

228
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,330
You know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids

229
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,330
not so long ago exactly the same question.

230
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,330
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.

231
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,330
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think,

232
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,330
"Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ... (Claps)

233
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,330
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.

234
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,330
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."

235
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,330
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way

236
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,330
other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.

237
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,330
In the same way that when we listen to music,

238
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,330
we assume that it's all being fed through here.

239
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,330
This is how we experience music. Of course it's not.

240
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,330
We experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think.

241
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:19,330
Listen, listen, listen. Now -- what can we do with thunder?

242
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,330
I remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson,

243
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,330
I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.

244
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,330
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,

245
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:39,330
arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape,

246
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,330
keep this amount of space here, etc.

247
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,330
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." --

248
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,330
where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen,

249
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,330
and I would not be able to strike the drum,

250
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,330
because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said,

251
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,330
"Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week."

252
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:02,330
So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks;

253
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,330
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.

254
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,330
I had to basically look at this particular drum,

255
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,330
see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.

256
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,330
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.

257
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,330
Experimented with my body, experimented with jewelry,

258
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,330
experimented with all sorts of things.

259
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,330
And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that --

260
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,330
but nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience,

261
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,330
because then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?

262
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,330
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book?

263
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,330
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books.

264
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,330
So for example, one of the things that we learn

265
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,330
when we are dealing with being a percussion player, as opposed to a musician,

266
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,330
is basically straightforward single stroke rolls.

267
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:21,330
Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.

268
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,330
And so on and so forth. What does this piece require?

269
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:32,330
Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?

270
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,330
And that's exactly what he did.

271
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,330
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student

272
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,330
at a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.

273
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,330
We had to study from study books.

274
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,330
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?

275
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,330
I need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!"

276
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,330
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music.

277
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,330
You know. I need to say something.

278
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,330
"Why am I practicing paradiddles?

279
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,330
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?

280
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,330
I need to have the reason,

281
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,330
and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."

282
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,330
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound,

283
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,330
we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.

284
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,330
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.

285
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,330
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall.

286
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,330
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.

287
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:50,330
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play

288
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,330
certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily

289
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,330
wanting you to feel exactly the same thing.

290
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,330
So please, the next time you go to a concert,

291
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:06,330
just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber.

292
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,330
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.

293
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,330
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound,

294
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,330
because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum,

295
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,330
or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc.,

296
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,330
or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.

297
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,330
They're experiencing that rawness there.

298
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,330
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure,

299
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,330
which is before the sound is actually happening.

300
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,330
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike,

301
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:52,330
or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound

302
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,330
in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey

303
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,330
of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.

304
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,330
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.

305
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,330
But thank you very much for having me!

306
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:18,330
(Applause)
