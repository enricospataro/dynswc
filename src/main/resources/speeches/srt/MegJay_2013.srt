1
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,280
When I was in my 20s,

2
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:17,748
I saw my very first psychotherapy client.

3
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:21,704
I was a Ph.D. student
in clinical psychology at Berkeley.

4
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,294
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.

5
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:30,749
Now Alex walked into her first session
wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,

6
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,860
and she dropped
onto the couch in my office

7
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,553
and kicked off her flats

8
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,805
and told me she was there
to talk about guy problems.

9
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,368
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.

10
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,912
My classmate got an arsonist
for her first client.

11
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,782
(Laughter)

12
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:51,903
And I got a twentysomething
who wanted to talk about boys.

13
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,441
This I thought I could handle.

14
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:56,513
But I didn't handle it.

15
00:00:57,356 --> 00:01:00,023
With the funny stories
that Alex would bring to session,

16
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,022
it was easy for me just to nod my head

17
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,212
while we kicked the can down the road.

18
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:06,492
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,

19
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,078
and as far as I could tell, she was right.

20
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:11,772
Work happened later,
marriage happened later,

21
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:15,238
kids happened later,
even death happened later.

22
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:19,520
Twentysomethings like Alex and I
had nothing but time.

23
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:26,210
But before long, my supervisor pushed me
to push Alex about her love life.

24
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,379
I pushed back.

25
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,497
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,

26
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:32,832
she's sleeping with a knucklehead,

27
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,466
but it's not like she's going
to marry the guy."

28
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,071
And then my supervisor said,

29
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:41,921
"Not yet, but she might marry
the next one.

30
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:46,303
Besides, the best time
to work on Alex's marriage

31
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:49,061
is before she has one."

32
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,070
That's what psychologists
call an "Aha!" moment.

33
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:56,204
That was the moment I realized,
30 is not the new 20.

34
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,995
Yes, people settle down later
than they used to,

35
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,394
but that didn't make Alex's 20s
a developmental downtime.

36
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:06,906
That made Alex's 20s
a developmental sweet spot,

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,534
and we were sitting there, blowing it.

38
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:13,988
That was when I realized
that this sort of benign neglect

39
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:17,985
was a real problem,
and it had real consequences,

40
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,399
not just for Alex and her love life

41
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,550
but for the careers
and the families and the futures

42
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,638
of twentysomethings everywhere.

43
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:31,289
There are 50 million twentysomethings
in the United States right now.

44
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,526
We're talking about 15 percent
of the population,

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,818
or 100 percent if you consider

46
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:42,385
that no one's getting through adulthood
without going through their 20s first.

47
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,508
(Laughter)

48
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,578
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.

49
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,888
I really want to see
some twentysomethings here.

50
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:49,417
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.

51
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:53,362
If you work with twentysomethings,
you love a twentysomething,

52
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,230
you're losing sleep
over twentysomethings, I want to see —

53
00:02:56,254 --> 00:03:00,104
Okay. Awesome,
twentysomethings really matter.

54
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:04,409
So, I specialize in twentysomethings
because I believe

55
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:08,307
that every single one of those
50 million twentysomethings

56
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,536
deserves to know what psychologists,

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,256
sociologists, neurologists
and fertility specialists

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,074
already know:

59
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:20,264
that claiming your 20s
is one of the simplest,

60
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:23,043
yet most transformative, things you can do

61
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,738
for work, for love, for your happiness,

62
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,527
maybe even for the world.

63
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,273
This is not my opinion.

64
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,867
These are the facts.

65
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,236
We know that 80 percent
of life's most defining moments

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,641
take place by age 35.

67
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,835
That means that eight out of 10

68
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,154
of the decisions and experiences
and "Aha!" moments

69
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,298
that make your life what it is

70
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,612
will have happened by your mid-30s.

71
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:52,525
People who are over 40, don't panic.

72
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,810
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.

73
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,960
We know that the first
10 years of a career

74
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:02,592
has an exponential impact
on how much money you're going to earn.

75
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,728
We know that more than half of Americans

76
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:08,898
are married or are living with or dating
their future partner by 30.

77
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,542
We know that the brain caps off

78
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,566
its second and last
growth spurt in your 20s

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,436
as it rewires itself for adulthood,

80
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,513
which means that whatever it is you want
to change about yourself,

81
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,544
now is the time to change it.

82
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,578
We know that personality
changes more during your 20s

83
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,284
than at any other time in life,

84
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:34,150
and we know that female fertility
peaks at age 28,

85
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,346
and things get tricky after age 35.

86
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,658
So your 20s are the time
to educate yourself

87
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:43,673
about your body and your options.

88
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,522
So when we think about child development,

89
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:50,487
we all know that the first
five years are a critical period

90
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,334
for language and attachment in the brain.

91
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:57,023
It's a time when your ordinary,
day-to-day life

92
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,710
has an inordinate impact
on who you will become.

93
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,591
But what we hear less about
is that there's such a thing

94
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:05,772
as adult development,

95
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:10,110
and our 20s are that critical period
of adult development.

96
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,134
But this isn't what
twentysomethings are hearing.

97
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,412
Newspapers talk about the changing
timetable of adulthood.

98
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,141
Researchers call the 20s
an extended adolescence.

99
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:25,369
Journalists coin silly nicknames
for twentysomethings

100
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,378
like "twixters" and "kidults."

101
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,601
(Laughing) It's true!

102
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,070
As a culture, we have trivialized

103
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:37,606
what is actually
the defining decade of adulthood.

104
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,911
Leonard Bernstein said
that to achieve great things,

105
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:45,047
you need a plan and not quite enough time.

106
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,123
(Laughing) Isn't that true?

107
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,729
So what do you think happens

108
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:52,373
when you pat a twentysomething
on the head and you say,

109
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:54,654
"You have 10 extra years
to start your life"?

110
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,453
Nothing happens.

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,475
You have robbed that person
of his urgency and ambition,

112
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,723
and absolutely nothing happens.

113
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:08,065
And then every day, smart,
interesting twentysomethings

114
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,323
like you or like your sons and daughters

115
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:14,689
come into my office
and say things like this:

116
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,086
"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,360
but this relationship doesn't count.
I'm just killing time."

118
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,555
Or they say, "Everybody says
as long as I get started

119
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:28,007
on a career by the time
I'm 30, I'll be fine."

120
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,453
But then it starts to sound like this:

121
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,913
"My 20s are almost over,
and I have nothing to show for myself.

122
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:39,977
I had a better résumé the day
after I graduated from college."

123
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,268
And then it starts to sound like this:

124
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,772
"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.

125
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:49,641
Everybody was running around
and having fun,

126
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,521
but then sometime around 30
it was like the music turned off

127
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,428
and everybody started sitting down.

128
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:57,404
I didn't want to be
the only one left standing up,

129
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,445
so sometimes I think I married my husband

130
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,967
because he was the closest
chair to me at 30."

131
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,994
Where are the twentysomethings here?

132
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:07,097
Do not do that.

133
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,099
(Laughter)

134
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:12,338
Okay, now that sounds a little flip,
but make no mistake,

135
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:14,346
the stakes are very high.

136
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,981
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,

137
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,308
there is enormous thirtysomething pressure

138
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:23,078
to jump-start a career,
pick a city, partner up,

139
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:26,620
and have two or three kids
in a much shorter period of time.

140
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,686
Many of these things are incompatible,

141
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,259
and as research is just starting to show,

142
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:36,886
simply harder and more stressful to do
all at once in our 30s.

143
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:42,492
The post-millennial midlife crisis
isn't buying a red sports car.

144
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:47,460
It's realizing you can't have
that career you now want.

145
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,469
It's realizing you can't have
that child you now want,

146
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,683
or you can't give your child a sibling.

147
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,414
Too many thirtysomethings
and fortysomethings

148
00:07:57,438 --> 00:08:01,440
look at themselves, and at me,
sitting across the room,

149
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,534
and say about their 20s,

150
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:07,184
"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"

151
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,605
I want to change what twentysomethings
are doing and thinking.

152
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,146
Here's a story about how that can go.

153
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,925
It's a story about a woman named Emma.

154
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,694
At 25, Emma came to my office

155
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:26,170
because she was, in her words,
having an identity crisis.

156
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:30,402
She said she thought she might
like to work in art or entertainment,

157
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,987
but she hadn't decided yet,

158
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,755
so she'd spent the last few years
waiting tables instead.

159
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,295
Because it was cheaper,
she lived with a boyfriend

160
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,451
who displayed his temper
more than his ambition.

161
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,100
And as hard as her 20s were,

162
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,206
her early life had been even harder.

163
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,032
She often cried in our sessions,

164
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,257
but then would collect herself by saying,

165
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,425
"You can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends."

166
00:08:56,965 --> 00:09:00,210
Well one day, Emma comes in
and she hangs her head in her lap,

167
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:03,352
and she sobbed for most of the hour.

168
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,077
She'd just bought a new address book,

169
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:09,777
and she'd spent the morning
filling in her many contacts,

170
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,411
but then she'd been left
staring at that empty blank

171
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,125
that comes after the words

172
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,879
"In case of emergency, please call ..."

173
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:21,360
She was nearly hysterical
when she looked at me and said,

174
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:24,660
"Who's going to be there for me
if I get in a car wreck?

175
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:27,561
Who's going to take care of me
if I have cancer?"

176
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:31,443
Now in that moment,
it took everything I had

177
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,121
not to say, "I will."

178
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,815
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist
who really, really cared.

179
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:42,113
Emma needed a better life,
and I knew this was her chance.

180
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,453
I had learned too much
since I first worked with Alex

181
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:50,063
to just sit there
while Emma's defining decade

182
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,560
went parading by.

183
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,923
So over the next weeks and months,

184
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:57,470
I told Emma three things

185
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,629
that every twentysomething,
male or female,

186
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,301
deserves to hear.

187
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:07,802
First, I told Emma to forget
about having an identity crisis

188
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:10,173
and get some identity capital.

189
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,743
By "get identity capital,"

190
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:16,387
I mean do something
that adds value to who you are.

191
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,900
Do something that's an investment

192
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:21,240
in who you might want to be next.

193
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,726
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,

194
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,987
and no one knows the future of work,

195
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:28,680
but I do know this:

196
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:31,930
Identity capital begets identity capital.

197
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:35,210
So now is the time
for that cross-country job,

198
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,982
that internship, that startup
you want to try.

199
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:42,173
I'm not discounting
twentysomething exploration here,

200
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:47,147
but I am discounting exploration
that's not supposed to count,

201
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:49,782
which, by the way, is not exploration.

202
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,750
That's procrastination.

203
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,058
I told Emma to explore
work and make it count.

204
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:02,652
Second, I told Emma
that the urban tribe is overrated.

205
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,686
Best friends are great
for giving rides to the airport,

206
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,464
but twentysomethings who huddle together
with like-minded peers

207
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:11,969
limit who they know,

208
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:14,367
what they know, how they think,

209
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,791
how they speak, and where they work.

210
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,569
That new piece of capital,
that new person to date

211
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:24,272
almost always comes
from outside the inner circle.

212
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:27,794
New things come
from what are called our weak ties,

213
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,035
our friends of friends of friends.

214
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:34,829
So yes, half of twentysomethings
are un- or under-employed.

215
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,867
But half aren't,

216
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,850
and weak ties are how
you get yourself into that group.

217
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,220
Half of new jobs are never posted,

218
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,749
so reaching out to your neighbor's boss
is how you get that unposted job.

219
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:52,187
It's not cheating. It's the science
of how information spreads.

220
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,245
Last but not least, Emma believed

221
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,443
that you can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends.

222
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,004
Now this was true for her growing up,

223
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,292
but as a twentysomething,
soon Emma would pick her family

224
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:08,076
when she partnered with someone
and created a family of her own.

225
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:12,843
I told Emma the time
to start picking your family is now.

226
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:18,366
Now you may be thinking that 30
is actually a better time to settle down

227
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,517
than 20, or even 25,

228
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,867
and I agree with you.

229
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,423
But grabbing whoever you're living
with or sleeping with

230
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:29,534
when everyone on Facebook
starts walking down the aisle

231
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,516
is not progress.

232
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:36,304
The best time to work on your marriage
is before you have one,

233
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:39,111
and that means being
as intentional with love

234
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,743
as you are with work.

235
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,172
Picking your family
is about consciously choosing

236
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,446
who and what you want

237
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,022
rather than just making it work
or killing time

238
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,559
with whoever happens to be choosing you.

239
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:55,450
So what happened to Emma?

240
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,045
Well, we went through that address book,

241
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,962
and she found an old roommate's cousin

242
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,723
who worked at an art museum
in another state.

243
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,166
That weak tie helped her get a job there.

244
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,108
That job offer gave her the reason
to leave that live-in boyfriend.

245
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:14,818
Now, five years later, she's a special
events planner for museums.

246
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:18,195
She's married to a man
she mindfully chose.

247
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:21,271
She loves her new career,
she loves her new family,

248
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:23,418
and she sent me a card that said,

249
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,430
"Now the emergency contact blanks

250
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:27,293
don't seem big enough."

251
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,498
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,

252
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:34,332
but that's what I love about working
with twentysomethings.

253
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,981
They are so easy to help.

254
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:40,369
Twentysomethings are like airplanes
just leaving LAX,

255
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,356
bound for somewhere west.

256
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:46,033
Right after takeoff,
a slight change in course

257
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:50,113
is the difference between landing
in Alaska or Fiji.

258
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,691
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,

259
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,493
one good conversation, one good break,

260
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,800
one good TED Talk,
can have an enormous effect

261
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:06,193
across years and even generations to come.

262
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,408
So here's an idea worth spreading

263
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,573
to every twentysomething you know.

264
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,858
It's as simple as what I learned
to say to Alex.

265
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:17,099
It's what I now have the privilege

266
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,952
of saying to twentysomethings
like Emma every single day:

267
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:25,938
Thirty is not the new 20,
so claim your adulthood,

268
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:29,535
get some identity capital,
use your weak ties,

269
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,184
pick your family.

270
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:34,329
Don't be defined by what you didn't know

271
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:35,421
or didn't do.

272
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,504
You're deciding your life right now.

273
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,138
Thank you.

274
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:43,584
(Applause)
