1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Can I ask you to please recall a time

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
when you really loved something --

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
a movie, an album, a song or a book --

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
and you recommended it wholeheartedly

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
to someone you also really liked,

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and it came back, and the person hated it?

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
So, by way of introduction,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
that is the exact same state

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
I teach high school math.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
I sell a product to a market

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
a useful stereotype about you all.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
I could give you guys

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
an algebra-two final exam,

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
and I would expect no higher

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
than a 25 percent pass rate.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
And both of these facts say less about you or my students

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
than they do about what we call math education

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
in the U.S. today.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
For example, factoring quadratics with

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
leading coefficients greater than one.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
provided you have a really strong grounding

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
in reasoning. Math reasoning --

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
we'll call it the application

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
of math processes to the world around us --

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
this is hard to teach.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
This is what we would love students to retain,

35
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
all but ensures they won't retain it.

38
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,820
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
to be a math teacher.

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
So first, five symptoms

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
that you're doing math reasoning wrong

44
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
in your classroom.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
You finish your lecture block

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
and immediately you have five hands going up

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Students lack perseverance.

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
They lack retention; you find yourself

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
There's an aversion to word problems,

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
which describes 99 percent of my students.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And then the other one percent

55
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
is eagerly looking for the formula

56
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
to apply in that situation.

57
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
This is really destructive.

58
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,

59
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
has a really good description for this.

60
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
He swore off creating

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
contemporary drama,

62
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
shows set in the present day,

63
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
because he saw that when people fill their mind

64
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,

65
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,

66
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
in such a way that they expect simple problems.

67
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."

68
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.

69
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,

70
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
three commercial breaks and a laugh track.

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
And I'll put it to all of you,

72
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.

73
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
I am very concerned about this

74
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.

75
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I'm doing bad things

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
to my own future and well-being

77
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
when I teach this way.

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly

79
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning

80
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and patient problem solving,

81
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
(Laughter)

83
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
It applies equally to math.

85
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Notice, first of all here,

86
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
each of which will figure into a formula

88
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
somewhere, eventually,

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
which the student will then compute.

90
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
I believe in real life.

91
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

92
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
that was worth solving

93
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
where you knew all of the given information in advance;

94
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,

95
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
or you didn't have sufficient information

96
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and had to go find some.

97
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students

99
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.

100
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,

101
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
we have problems like this right here

102
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
it helpfully explains to you

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
You could literally, I mean this,

107
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,

108
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.

109
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.

110
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.

111
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
It's about defining steepness and slope

112
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
using a ski lift.

113
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,

114
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers

115
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

116
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
and presented to the student all at once,

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
how that creates this impatient problem solving.

118
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
I'll define them here: You have the visual.

119
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
You also have the mathematical structure,

120
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
talking about grids, measurements, labels,

121
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
points, axes, that sort of thing.

122
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:

123
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
which section is the steepest.

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
So I hope you can see.

125
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here

126
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,

127
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
but we're paving a smooth, straight path

128
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
from one to the other

129
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and congratulating our students for how well

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
they can step over the small cracks in the way.

131
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
That's all we're doing here.

132
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way

133
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
and build them up with students,

134
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.

135
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
So right here I start with the visual,

136
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
and I immediately ask the question:

137
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Which section is the steepest?

138
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
And this starts conversation

139
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.

140
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
So you get people arguing against each other,

141
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
friend versus friend,

142
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
in pairs, journaling, whatever.

143
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
And then eventually we realize

144
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
it's getting annoying to talk about

145
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen

146
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
or the skier just above the mid line.

147
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
And we realize how great would it be

148
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels

149
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
to talk about them more easily.

150
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,

151
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements

152
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.

153
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
And then and only then,

154
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
we throw down that mathematical structure.

155
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
The math serves the conversation,

156
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
the conversation doesn't serve the math.

157
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes

158
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.

159
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
But if you need to,

160
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
your students can then develop those substeps together.

161
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --

162
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?

163
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.

164
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,

165
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
who, I believe, has paid his dues.

166
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,

167
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,

168
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
we just give problems to students;

169
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.

170
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
So 90 percent of what I do

171
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
with my five hours of prep time per week

172
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
is to take fairly compelling elements

173
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
of problems like this from my textbook

174
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.

175
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And here's how it works.

176
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
I like this question. It's about a water tank.

177
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?

178
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.

179
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
Students have to develop those,

180
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
they have to formulate those.

181
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.

182
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

183
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Students need to decide, "All right, well,

184
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?

185
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"

186
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.

187
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
So now we have a water tank.

188
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.

189
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
And because this is the 21st century

190
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,

191
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
not in terms of line art or clip art

192
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
that you so often see in textbooks,

193
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
we go out and we take a picture of it.

194
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
So now we have the real deal.

195
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
How long will it take it to fill it up?

196
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
And then even better is we take a video,

197
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
a video of someone filling it up.

198
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.

199
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
It's tedious.

200
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,

201
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and they're all wondering at some point or another,

202
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"

203
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
(Laughter)

204
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?

205
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me

206
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
because, like the intro,

207
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --

208
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?

209
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math

210
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
because someone else has the formula;

211
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,

212
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
so I won't talk about it.

213
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.

214
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Everyone's filled something up with water before,

215
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"

216
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated

217
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
joining the conversation.

218
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,

219
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
and kids have bought in here.

220
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And then we follow the process I've described.

221
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
And the best part here, or one of the better parts

222
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key

223
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
in the back of the teacher's edition.

224
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.

225
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
(Laughter)

226
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
And that's terrifying,

227
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
because the theoretical models that always work out

228
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,

229
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
that's great, but

230
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
it's scary to talk about sources of error

231
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
But those conversations have been so valuable,

233
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
among the most valuable.

234
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So I'm here to report some really fun games

235
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
with students who come pre-installed

236
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
with these viruses day one of the class.

237
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
These are the kids who now, one semester in,

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
I can put something on the board,

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
totally new, totally foreign,

240
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more

241
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
than they would have at the start of the year,

242
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
which is just so fun.

243
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
We're no longer averse to word problems,

244
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
because we've redefined what a word problem is.

245
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
We're no longer intimidated by math,

246
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
because we're slowly redefining what math is.

247
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
This has been a lot of fun.

248
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,

249
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
because it brings the real world into your classroom

250
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
in high resolution and full color;

251
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;

252
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
to ask the shortest question you possibly can

253
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;

254
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
to let students build the problem,

255
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
because Einstein said so;

256
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,

257
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:

258
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
It's buying you out of your obligation,

259
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.

260
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now

261
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
is because we have the tools to create

262
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.

263
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,

264
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
and the tools to distribute it

265
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
freely under open licenses

266
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

267
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago

268
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.

269
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited

270
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.

271
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"

272
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
which, wow.

273
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I put this problem on my blog recently:

274
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,

275
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
the one that has one cart and 19 items

276
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.

277
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,

278
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,

279
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
which is just bizarre, right?

280
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And from all of this, I can only conclude

281
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
that people, not just students,

282
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
are really hungry for this.

283
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
Math makes sense of the world.

284
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Math is the vocabulary

285
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
for your own intuition.

286
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --

287
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --

288
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
insist on better math curriculum.

289
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)
