1
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,443
(Breathes in)

2
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:25,204
(Breathes out)

3
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,779
So, I didn't always make
my living from music.

4
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,683
For about the five years after graduating

5
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:38,812
from an upstanding
liberal arts university,

6
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:41,174
this was my day job.

7
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,899
(Laughter)

8
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:47,467
I was a self-employed living
statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,

9
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,207
and I love telling people
I did this for a job,

10
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,192
because everybody always wants to know,

11
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,171
who are these freaks in real life.

12
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,196
(Laughter)

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,235
Hello.

14
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,867
I painted myself white
one day, stood on a box,

15
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,275
put a hat or a can at my feet,

16
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,626
and when someone came by
and dropped in money,

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,311
I handed them a flower --

18
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:12,365
and some intense eye contact.

19
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,507
And if they didn't take the flower,

20
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,601
I threw in a gesture
of sadness and longing --

21
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:21,062
as they walked away.

22
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,192
(Laughter)

23
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:31,431
So I had the most profound
encounters with people,

24
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:32,766
especially lonely people

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,115
who looked like they hadn't talked
to anyone in weeks,

26
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:42,108
and we would get this beautiful moment
of prolonged eye contact

27
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:44,425
being allowed in a city street,

28
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:47,070
and we would sort of fall
in love a little bit.

29
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,380
And my eyes would say --

30
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:51,253
"Thank you.

31
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:52,848
I see you."

32
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,100
And their eyes would say --

33
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,648
"Nobody ever sees me.

34
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,721
Thank you."

35
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,213
I would get harassed sometimes.

36
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,301
People would yell at me from their cars.

37
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:07,387
"Get a job!"

38
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,007
(Laughing) And I'd be, like,

39
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,164
"This is my job."

40
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:15,570
But it hurt, because it made me fear

41
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,828
that I was somehow doing
something un-joblike

42
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,760
and unfair, shameful.

43
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:27,815
I had no idea how perfect
a real education I was getting

44
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,951
for the music business on this box.

45
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,147
And for the economists out there,

46
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,752
you may be interested to know I actually
made a pretty predictable income,

47
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:39,967
which was shocking to me,
given I had no regular customers,

48
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,255
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
90 bucks on a Friday.

49
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,540
It was consistent.

50
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,024
And meanwhile, I was touring locally
and playing in nightclubs

51
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,886
with my band, the Dresden Dolls.

52
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,984
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.

53
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,897
I wrote the songs, and eventually

54
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:58,283
we started making enough money
that I could quit being a statue,

55
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,544
and as we started touring,

56
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,918
I really didn't want to lose this sense

57
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:05,618
of direct connection with people,
because I loved it.

58
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:09,573
So after all of our shows,
we would sign autographs

59
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,485
and hug fans and hang out
and talk to people,

60
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:18,177
and we made an art out
of asking people to help us and join us,

61
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:21,323
and I would track down
local musicians and artists

62
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:24,515
and they would set up
outside of our shows,

63
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,003
and they would pass the hat,

64
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,503
and then they would come in
and join us onstage,

65
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:31,912
so we had this rotating smorgasbord
of weird, random circus guests.

66
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,016
And then Twitter came along,

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,072
and made things even more magic,

68
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,831
because I could ask instantly
for anything anywhere.

69
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,896
So I would need a piano to practice on,

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,189
and an hour later I would be
at a fan's house.

71
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,250
This is in London.

72
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,734
People would bring home-cooked food to us

73
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,473
all over the world backstage
and feed us and eat with us.

74
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,879
This is in Seattle.

75
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:55,506
Fans who worked in museums and stores

76
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,713
and any kind of public space
would wave their hands

77
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,977
if I would decide to do
a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.

78
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,613
This is a library in Auckland.

79
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:09,877
On Saturday I tweeted
for this crate and hat,

80
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,660
because I did not want to schlep them
from the East Coast,

81
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:15,707
and they showed up care of this dude,
Chris, from Newport Beach,

82
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,862
who says hello.

83
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:21,146
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne
can I buy a neti pot?"

84
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,676
And a nurse from a hospital drove one

85
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,947
right at that moment to the cafe I was in,

86
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:27,415
and I bought her a smoothie

87
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,979
and we sat there talking
about nursing and death.

88
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,034
And I love this kind of random closeness,

89
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:36,415
which is lucky, because I do
a lot of couchsurfing.

90
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:40,838
In mansions where everyone
in my crew gets their own room

91
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:42,115
but there's no wireless,

92
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,671
and in punk squats,

93
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:46,633
everyone on the floor
in one room with no toilets

94
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:49,652
but with wireless,
clearly making it the better option.

95
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,232
(Laughter)

96
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,885
My crew once pulled our van
up to a really poor Miami neighborhood

97
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,591
and we found out that our couchsurfing
host for the night

98
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:04,178
was an 18-year-old girl,
still living at home,

99
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:08,305
and her family were all undocumented
immigrants from Honduras.

100
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:12,202
And that night, her whole family

101
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:15,279
took the couches and she slept
together with her mom

102
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,033
so that we could take their beds.

103
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,675
And I lay there thinking,

104
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,398
these people have so little.

105
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,699
Is this fair?

106
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,906
And in the morning,

107
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,253
her mom taught us
how to try to make tortillas

108
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:31,254
and wanted to give me a Bible,

109
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:36,847
and she took me aside and she said
to me in her broken English,

110
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:41,325
"Your music has helped
my daughter so much.

111
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:45,040
Thank you for staying here.
We're all so grateful."

112
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:49,268
And I thought, this is fair.

113
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:52,127
This is this.

114
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,045
A couple of months later,
I was in Manhattan,

115
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,333
and I tweeted for a crash pad,
and at midnight,

116
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,135
I'm on the Lower East Side,

117
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,928
and it occurs to me I've never
actually done this alone.

118
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:04,905
I've always been with my band or my crew.

119
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,767
Is this what stupid people do?

120
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,234
(Laughter)

121
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,701
Is this how stupid people die?

122
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:13,689
And before I can change my mind,
the door busts open.

123
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:14,744
She's an artist.

124
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:17,088
He's a financial blogger for Reuters,

125
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,126
and they're pouring me a glass of red wine

126
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,297
and offering me a bath,

127
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:24,654
and I have had thousands of nights
like that and like that.

128
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,277
So I couchsurf a lot.
I also crowdsurf a lot.

129
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,605
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing

130
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,539
are basically the same thing.

131
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,358
You're falling into the audience

132
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:38,898
and you're trusting each other.

133
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,513
I once asked an opening band of mine

134
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:44,204
if they wanted to go out
into the crowd and pass the hat

135
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,918
to get some extra money,
something that I did a lot.

136
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,730
And as usual, the band was psyched,

137
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:50,928
but there was this one guy in the band

138
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,810
who told me he just couldn't
bring himself to go out there.

139
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,524
It felt too much like begging
to stand there with the hat.

140
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,648
And I recognized his fear

141
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,761
of "Is this fair?"

142
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,123
and "Get a job."

143
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:10,652
And meanwhile, my band
is becoming bigger and bigger.

144
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,205
We sign with a major label.

145
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,745
And our music is a cross
between punk and cabaret.

146
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,151
It's not for everybody.

147
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,602
Well, maybe it's for you.

148
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,710
(Laughter)

149
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,530
We sign, and there's all this hype
leading up to our next record.

150
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:29,223
And it comes out and it sells
about 25,000 copies

151
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,536
in the first few weeks,

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
and the label considers this a failure.

153
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,417
I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"

154
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,409
They said, "No, the sales are going down.

155
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,449
It's a failure."

156
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,488
And they walk off.

157
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:44,758
Right at this same time,
I'm signing and hugging after a gig,

158
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,549
and a guy comes up to me

159
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,751
and hands me a $10 bill,

160
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:50,432
and he says,

161
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,836
"I'm sorry, I burned
your CD from a friend."

162
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:57,181
(Laughter)

163
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,647
"But I read your blog,
I know you hate your label.

164
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,454
I just want you to have this money."

165
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,490
And this starts happening all the time.

166
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:10,486
I become the hat after my own gigs,

167
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,772
but I have to physically stand there
and take the help from people,

168
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:15,981
and unlike the guy in the opening band,

169
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,799
I've actually had a lot
of practice standing there.

170
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:21,672
Thank you.

171
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,278
And this is the moment I decide

172
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:27,170
I'm just going to give away
my music for free

173
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:28,902
online whenever possible,

174
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,388
so it's like Metallica
over here, Napster, bad;

175
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,078
Amanda Palmer over here,

176
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,377
and I'm going to encourage
torrenting, downloading, sharing,

177
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,499
but I'm going to ask for help,

178
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:42,226
because I saw it work on the street.

179
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,723
So I fought my way off my label,
and for my next project

180
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,427
with my new band,
the Grand Theft Orchestra,

181
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,161
I turned to crowdfunding.

182
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,323
And I fell into those thousands
of connections that I'd made,

183
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,454
and I asked my crowd to catch me.

184
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,454
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.

185
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:04,993
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,

186
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,899
which was the biggest music
crowdfunding project to date.

187
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,987
(Applause)

188
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:15,337
And you can see how many people it is.

189
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,170
It's about 25,000 people.

190
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,529
And the media asked,

191
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:25,007
"Amanda, the music business is tanking
and you encourage piracy.

192
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,365
How did you make
all these people pay for music?"

193
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,750
And the real answer is,
I didn't make them.

194
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:31,218
I asked them.

195
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,916
And through the very act of asking people,

196
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,632
I'd connected with them,

197
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:41,506
and when you connect with them,
people want to help you.

198
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,561
It's kind of counterintuitive
for a lot of artists.

199
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,251
They don't want to ask for things.

200
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,928
But it's not easy.

201
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,419
It's not easy to ask.

202
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:56,118
And a lot of artists have
a problem with this.

203
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,841
Asking makes you vulnerable.

204
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:02,957
And I got a lot of criticism online,

205
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,578
after my Kickstarter went big,

206
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,537
for continuing my crazy
crowdsourcing practices,

207
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,418
specifically for asking musicians

208
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,791
who are fans if they wanted
to join us on stage

209
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:17,106
for a few songs in exchange
for love and tickets and beer,

210
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,630
and this was a doctored image
that went up of me on a website.

211
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:25,045
And this hurt in a really familiar way.

212
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,478
And people saying,

213
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,531
"You're not allowed anymore
to ask for that kind of help,"

214
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:34,751
really reminded me of the people
in their cars yelling, "Get a job."

215
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,772
Because they weren't
with us on the sidewalk,

216
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:43,029
and they couldn't see the exchange

217
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,101
that was happening
between me and my crowd,

218
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,458
an exchange that was very fair
to us but alien to them.

219
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,791
So this is slightly not safe for work.

220
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,378
This is my Kickstarter
backer party in Berlin.

221
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:58,435
At the end of the night, I stripped
and let everyone draw on me.

222
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,452
Now let me tell you,
if you want to experience

223
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,947
the visceral feeling
of trusting strangers --

224
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,418
(Laughter)

225
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:06,633
I recommend this,

226
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:10,000
especially if those strangers
are drunk German people.

227
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,935
(Laughter)

228
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,779
This was a ninja
master-level fan connection,

229
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:18,299
because what I was really saying here was,

230
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:19,867
I trust you this much.

231
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:22,036
Should I?

232
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:23,804
Show me.

233
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,055
For most of human history,

234
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,134
musicians, artists, they've been
part of the community.

235
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:36,080
Connectors and openers,
not untouchable stars.

236
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,972
Celebrity is about a lot of people
loving you from a distance,

237
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,141
but the Internet

238
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:45,766
and the content that we're freely
able to share on it

239
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,067
are taking us back.

240
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:52,248
It's about a few people
loving you up close

241
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:55,522
and about those people being enough.

242
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:58,950
So a lot of people
are confused by the idea

243
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:00,265
of no hard sticker price.

244
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,487
They see it as an unpredictable risk,
but the things I've done,

245
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:05,899
the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,

246
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,753
I don't see these things as risk.

247
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,077
I see them as trust.

248
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,889
Now, the online tools

249
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:16,661
to make the exchange as easy
and as instinctive as the street,

250
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,883
they're getting there.

251
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:21,998
But the perfect tools
aren't going to help us

252
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,466
if we can't face each other

253
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,525
and give and receive fearlessly,

254
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,748
but, more important --

255
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:32,933
to ask without shame.

256
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,396
My music career has been spent

257
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,969
trying to encounter people on the Internet
the way I could on the box.

258
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:45,311
So blogging and tweeting
not just about my tour dates

259
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:48,902
and my new video
but about our work and our art

260
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:52,043
and our fears and our hangovers,

261
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,485
our mistakes,

262
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,970
and we see each other.

263
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,354
And I think when we really see each other,

264
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,234
we want to help each other.

265
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,722
I think people have been obsessed
with the wrong question,

266
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,634
which is, "How do we make
people pay for music?"

267
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:13,446
What if we started asking,

268
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,484
"How do we let people pay for music?"

269
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,496
Thank you.

270
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,520
(Applause)
