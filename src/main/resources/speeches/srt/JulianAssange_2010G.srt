1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
has, in the last few years

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
has released more classified documents

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
than the rest of the world's media combined.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
Can that possibly be true?

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
is doing such a bad job

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
that a little group of activists

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
is able to release more

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
of that type of information

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
than the rest of the world press combined.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
CA: How does it work?

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
How do people release the documents?

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
And how do you secure their privacy?

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
JA: So these are -- as far as we can tell --

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
classical whistleblowers,

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
and we have a number of ways for them

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
to get information to us.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
pass it through legal jurisdictions

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
like Sweden and Belgium

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
to enact those legal protections.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
We get information in the mail,

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
the regular postal mail,

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
encrypted or not,

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
vet it like a regular news organization, format it --

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
when you're talking about

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
giant databases of information --

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
release it to the public

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
and then defend ourselves

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
against the inevitable legal and political attacks.

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
CA: So you make an effort to ensure

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
the documents are legitimate,

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
but you actually

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
almost never know who the identity of the source is?

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and if we find out at some stage

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
then we destroy that information as soon as possible.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
(Phone ring) God damn it.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
(Laughter)

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
for a TED membership.

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
(Laughter)

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
So let's take [an] example, actually.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
This is something

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
you leaked a few years ago.

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
If we can have this document up ...

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.

53
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
JA: So this is the Kroll Report.

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
This was a secret intelligence report

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
commissioned by the Kenyan government

57
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
after its election in 2004.

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
by Daniel arap Moi

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
for about 18 years.

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
And when Kibaki got into power --

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
through a coalition of forces that were trying

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
to clean up corruption in Kenya --

65
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
they commissioned this report,

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
spent about two million pounds

67
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
on this and an associated report.

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And then the government sat on it

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
and used it for political leverage on Moi,

70
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
who was the richest man --

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
still is the richest man -- in Kenya.

72
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
So I went there in 2007,

74
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
and we managed to get hold of this

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
just prior to the election --

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
the national election, December 28.

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
When we released that report,

78
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
had decided to pal up with

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
the man that he was going to clean out,

81
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
Daniel arap Moi,

82
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
so this report then

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
became a dead albatross

84
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
around President Kibaki's neck.

85
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short --

86
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
word of the report leaked into Kenya,

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
not from the official media, but indirectly,

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.

89
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,

91
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
in Tanzanian and South African press.

92
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
And so it came in from the outside.

93
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
And that, after a couple of days,

94
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,

96
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
shifted the vote by 10 percent,

97
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
according to a Kenyan intelligence report,

98
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
which changed the result of the election.

99
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
CA: Wow, so your leak

100
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
really substantially changed the world?

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
JA: Yep.

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,820
(Applause)

103
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
CA: Here's -- We're going to just show

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
a short clip from this

105
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
Baghdad airstrike video.

106
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
The video itself is longer,

107
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
but here's a short clip.

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you.

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,820
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...

111
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
You're clear. All right. Firing.

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.

113
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Light 'em all up.

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
C'mon, fire!

115
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
(Machine gun fire)

116
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.

117
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
(Machine gun fire)

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Keep shoot 'n.

119
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,

120
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
we need to move, time now!

121
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.

122
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Roger. I got 'em.

124
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.

125
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?

126
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.

127
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
CA: So, what was the impact of that?

128
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
was severe.

130
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
to further research that story.

132
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
So this is just the first of three attacks

133
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
that occurred in that scene.

134
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,

135
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
including two Reuters employees?

136
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,

137
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
two young children were wounded.

138
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.

139
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
CA: And releasing this caused

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
widespread outrage.

141
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
What was the key element of this

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
that actually caused the outrage, do you think?

143
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
the gross disparity in force.

145
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer

147
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
firing 30-millimeter cannon shells

148
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
on everyone --

149
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
looking for any excuse to do so --

150
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
and killing people rescuing the wounded.

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents

152
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
because that's their full-time job.

153
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,

154
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Bradley Manning, arrested,

155
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room

156
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
to have leaked this video to you,

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
along with 280,000

158
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
classified U.S. embassy cables.

159
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
I mean, did he?

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
JA: We have denied receiving those cables.

161
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
He has been charged,

162
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
about five days ago,

163
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
with obtaining 150,000 cables

164
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
and releasing 50.

165
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Now, we had released,

166
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
early in the year,

167
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,

168
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
but this is not necessarily connected.

169
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.

170
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands

171
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...

172
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?)

173
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?)

174
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
JA: Well, because these sort of things

175
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
reveal what the true state

176
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
of, say,

177
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Arab governments are like,

178
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
the true human-rights abuses in those governments.

179
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
If you look at declassified cables,

180
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
that's the sort of material that's there.

181
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.

182
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?

183
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Why is it right

184
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
to encourage leaking of secret information?

185
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,

186
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
what sort of information

187
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
can achieve reform.

188
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And there's a lot of information.

189
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
So information that organizations

190
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
are spending economic effort into concealing,

191
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
that's a really good signal

192
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
that when the information gets out,

193
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
there's a hope of it doing some good --

194
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
because the organizations that know it best,

195
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
that know it from the inside out,

196
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
are spending work to conceal it.

197
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
And that's what we've found in practice,

198
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
and that's what the history of journalism is.

199
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
CA: But are there risks with that,

200
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
either to the individuals concerned

201
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
or indeed to society at large,

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
where leaking can actually have

203
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
an unintended consequence?

204
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.

205
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.

206
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
We have a way of dealing with information

207
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
that has sort of personal --

208
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
personally identifying information in it.

209
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
But there are legitimate secrets --

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
you know, your records with your doctor;

211
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
that's a legitimate secret --

212
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward

213
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
that are really sort of well-motivated.

214
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
CA: So they are well-motivated.

215
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And what would you say to, for example,

216
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
the, you know, the parent of someone

217
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
whose son is out serving the U.S. military,

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
and he says, "You know what,

219
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.

220
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing

221
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
at people dying.

222
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
That gives the impression, has given the impression,

223
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
to millions of people around the world

224
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.

225
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"

226
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
What would you say to that?

227
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.

228
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
But remember, the people in Baghdad,

229
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan --

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
they don't need to see the video;

231
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
they see it every day.

232
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.

233
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
That's what they see every day.

234
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
It will change the perception and opinion

235
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
of the people who are paying for it all,

236
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
and that's our hope.

237
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
CA: So you found a way to shine light

238
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
into what you see

239
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.

240
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Light is good.

241
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
But do you see any irony in the fact that,

242
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
in order for you to shine that light,

243
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
you have to, yourself,

244
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
create secrecy around your sources?

245
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have

246
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.

247
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.

248
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,

249
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
but we're presumably acting in such a way

250
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
that people feel

251
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
morally compelled

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
to continue our mission, not to screw it up.

253
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far --

254
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.

255
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
You know, there might be a couple of views

256
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
of WikiLeaks and of Julian.

257
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
You know, hero -- people's hero --

258
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
bringing this important light.

259
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Dangerous troublemaker.

260
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Who's got the hero view?

261
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?

262
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.

263
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.

264
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.

265
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked,

266
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
but I think for TED you are.

267
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?

268
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
What is this?

269
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
JA: So this is a sample of what we do

270
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
sort of every day.

271
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
So late last year -- in November last year --

272
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
there was a series of well blowouts

273
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
in Albania,

274
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,

275
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
but not quite as big.

276
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
And we got a report --

277
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
a sort of engineering analysis into what happened --

278
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
saying that, in fact, security guards

279
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
from some rival, various competing oil firms

280
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.

281
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.

282
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
And the engineering report

283
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
had nothing on the top of it,

284
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
so it was an extremely difficult document for us.

285
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know

286
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
who wrote it and knew what it was about.

287
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was

288
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.

289
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
So under that basis, we put it out and said,

290
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.

291
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
We don't know, but what can we do?

292
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
The material looks good, it feels right,

293
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
but we just can't verify it."

294
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
And we then got a letter

295
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
just this week

296
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
from the company who wrote it,

297
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
wanting to track down the source --

298
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
(Laughter)

299
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."

300
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.

301
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?

302
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?

303
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Is it really yours?"

304
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
So they sent us this screen shot

305
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
with the author

306
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
in the Microsoft Word ID.

307
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Yeah.

308
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,820
(Applause)

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
That's happened quite a lot though.

310
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
This is like one of our methods

311
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
of identifying, of verifying, what a material is,

312
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
is to try and get these guys to write letters.

313
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
CA: Yeah. Have you had information

314
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
from inside BP?

315
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,

316
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.

317
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
So our publication rate

318
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
over the past few months

319
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
has been sort of minimized

320
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
while we're re-engineering our back systems

321
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
for the phenomenal public interest that we have.

322
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
That's a problem.

323
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,

324
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
we are sort of overwhelmed

325
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
by our growth,

326
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
and that means we're getting enormous quantity

327
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
of whistleblower disclosures

328
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
of a very high caliber

329
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
but don't have enough people to actually

330
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
process and vet this information.

331
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
CA: So that's the key bottleneck,

332
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
basically journalistic volunteers

333
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
and/or the funding of journalistic salaries?

334
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.

335
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
I mean, we're an organization

336
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
that is hard to grow very quickly

337
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
because of the sort of material we deal with,

338
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
so we have to restructure

339
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
in order to have people

340
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
who will deal with the highest national security stuff,

341
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
and then lower security cases.

342
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally

343
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
and how you came to do this.

344
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And I think I read that as a kid

345
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
you went to 37 different schools.

346
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Can that be right?

347
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business

348
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
and then on the run from a cult,

349
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
so the combination between the two ...

350
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,820
(Laughter)

351
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
CA: I mean, a psychologist might say

352
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.

353
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
JA: What, the movie business?

354
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
(Laughter)

355
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
(Applause)

356
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
CA: And you were also -- I mean,

357
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
you were also a hacker at an early age

358
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
and ran into the authorities early on.

359
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
JA: Well, I was a journalist.

360
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.

361
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
I wrote a magazine,

362
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.

363
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
So you have to be careful with hacker.

364
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
I mean there's like -- there's a method

365
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
that can be deployed for various things.

366
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Unfortunately, at the moment,

367
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia

368
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.

369
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
So this phrase is not,

370
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
not as nice as it used to be.

371
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think

372
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,

373
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
but what about

374
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
your core values?

375
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Can you give us a sense of what they are

376
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
and maybe some incident in your life

377
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
that helped determine them?

378
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
JA: I'm not sure about the incident.

379
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
But the core values:

380
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
well, capable, generous men

381
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
do not create victims;

382
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
they nurture victims.

383
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
And that's something from my father

384
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
and something from other capable, generous men

385
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
that have been in my life.

386
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;

387
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
they nurture victims?

388
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
JA: Yeah. And you know,

389
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm a combative person,

390
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
so I'm not actually so big on the nurture,

391
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
but some way --

392
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
there is another way of nurturing victims,

393
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
which is to police perpetrators

394
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
of crime.

395
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
And so that is something

396
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
that has been in my character

397
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
for a long time.

398
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:

399
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
what happened in Iceland?

400
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
You basically published something there,

401
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
ran into trouble with a bank,

402
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
then the news service there

403
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
was injuncted from running the story.

404
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Instead, they publicized your side.

405
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?

406
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.

407
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Iceland went through this financial crisis.

408
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.

409
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP

410
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
of the rest of the economy.

411
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Anyway, so we release this report

412
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
in July last year.

413
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
And the national TV station was injuncted

414
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
five minutes before it went on air,

415
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,

416
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
and the news reader was like,

417
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
"This has never happened before. What do we do?"

418
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Well, we just show the website instead,

419
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,820
for all that time, as a filler,

420
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
and we became very famous in Iceland,

421
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.

422
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
And there was a feeling in the community

423
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
that that should never happen again,

424
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
and as a result,

425
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
working with Icelandic politicians

426
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
and some other international legal experts,

427
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
we put together a new sort of

428
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,820
package of legislation for Iceland

429
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
to sort of become an offshore haven

430
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
for the free press,

431
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,

432
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
with a new Nobel Prize

433
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
for freedom of speech.

434
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
Iceland's a Nordic country,

435
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.

436
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
And just a month ago,

437
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.

438
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
CA: Wow.

439
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,820
(Applause)

440
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Last question, Julian.

441
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
When you think of the future then,

442
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
do you think it's more likely to be

443
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
Big Brother exerting more control,

444
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
more secrecy,

445
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
or us watching

446
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Big Brother,

447
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,820
or it's just all to be played for either way?

448
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.

449
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
I mean, there's enormous pressures

450
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
to harmonize freedom of speech legislation

451
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
and transparency legislation around the world --

452
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
within the E.U.,

453
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
between China and the United States.

454
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.

455
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in --

456
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
because with just a little bit of effort,

457
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
we can shift it one way or the other.

458
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,820
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion

459
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
to say, Julian, be careful,

460
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
and all power to you.

461
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.)

462
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:22,820
(Applause)
