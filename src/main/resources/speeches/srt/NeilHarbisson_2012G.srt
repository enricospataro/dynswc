1
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:16,011
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

2
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:19,724
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

3
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,594
so I've never seen color,

4
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:24,117
and I don't know what color looks like,

5
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:27,092
because I come from a grayscale world.

6
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,752
To me, the sky is always gray,

7
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,604
flowers are always gray,

8
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,806
and television is still in black and white.

9
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:36,099
But, since the age of 21,

10
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:40,228
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

11
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:43,204
In 2003, I started a project

12
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:45,892
with computer scientist Adam Montandon,

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:49,059
and the result, with further collaborations

14
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,907
with Peter Kese from Slovenia

15
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,940
and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,305
is this electronic eye.

17
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:58,661
It's a color sensor that detects

18
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:02,244
the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —

19
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,596
and sends this frequency to a chip installed

20
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,587
at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me

21
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:10,483
through the bone, through bone conduction.

22
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:13,991
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —

23
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,511
This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)

24
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:27,929
For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)

25
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,054
This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)

26
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:34,423
This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)

27
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,300
Which is like yellow, this one.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,357
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,

29
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,992
since 2004, so I find it completely normal now

30
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,471
to hear color all the time.

31
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:49,845
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give

32
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,251
for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,

33
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,187
but after some time, all this information

34
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,180
became a perception.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,939
I didn't have to think about the notes.

36
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,564
And after some time, this perception became a feeling.

37
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,570
I started to have favorite colors,

38
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,344
and I started to dream in colors.

39
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:08,619
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt

40
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,506
that the software and my brain had united,

41
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,462
because in my dreams, it was my brain creating

42
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,823
electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,

43
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:20,342
so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.

44
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:23,392
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device

45
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,582
was no longer a device.

46
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,997
It had become a part of my body,

47
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:30,462
an extension of my senses,

48
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:33,088
and after some time, it even became a part

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,615
of my official image.

50
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,961
This is my passport from 2004.

51
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:42,046
You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports

52
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,858
with electronic equipment, but I insisted

53
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:47,259
to the passport office that what they were seeing

54
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,763
was actually a new part of my body,

55
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:53,283
an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me

56
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,794
to appear with the passport photo.

57
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:59,251
So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,

58
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,845
because color is almost everywhere,

59
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:04,722
so the biggest change for example is

60
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:09,260
going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,

61
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,114
for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,

62
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:14,325
because I can listen to the paintings.

63
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,786
And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,

64
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:19,736
it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.

65
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,224
It's like going to a nightclub.

66
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:24,480
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,555
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

68
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:29,906
It's just fabulous. (Laughter)

69
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,378
Also, the way I dress has changed.

70
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,786
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

71
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:39,363
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)

72
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:44,494
(Applause)

73
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:47,003
So today I'm dressed in C major,

74
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:50,312
so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)

75
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:52,186
If I had to go to a funeral, though,

76
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:54,753
I would dress in B minor, which would be

77
00:03:54,753 --> 00:04:03,512
turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)

78
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:07,857
Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,

79
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:11,313
because now I can display the food on a plate,

80
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:14,265
so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)

81
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,494
So depending on how I display it,

82
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:18,244
I can hear and I can compose music with food.

83
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,969
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,

84
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,953
Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,

85
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:26,970
this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.

86
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,409
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos

87
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,643
as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,

88
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:36,752
that would be a very exciting restaurant

89
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:39,512
where you can actually eat songs.

90
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:43,962
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,

91
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:48,642
because when I look at someone, I hear their face,

92
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:53,644
so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.

93
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,405
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,

94
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,653
the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,

95
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,382
sound portraits of people.

96
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,022
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,

97
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,453
I point at them with the eye and I write down

98
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,724
the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.

99
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,461
Here's some faces.

100
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:24,988
(Musical chords)

101
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:28,421
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)

102
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,470
Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.

103
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,268
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.

104
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,405
They have similar sound of eyes.

105
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,453
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,

106
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,966
and you can actually also create concerts

107
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,606
by looking at the audience faces.

108
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:47,702
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.

109
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,206
The good thing about this is,

110
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:52,173
if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.

111
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:54,444
It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)

112
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:58,751
And so another thing that happens is that

113
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,628
I started having this secondary effect

114
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,958
that normal sounds started to become color.

115
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,719
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green

116
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,045
because it sounded just like the color green.

117
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,343
The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,

118
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:17,470
and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,

119
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,230
so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,

120
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,173
because people's voices have frequencies

121
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,716
that I relate to color.

122
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:30,835
And here's some music translated into color.

123
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:36,035
For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.

124
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,847
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,

125
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,037
because there's many different frequencies.

126
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,947
(Music)

127
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:46,277
And this is a completely different song.

128
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:50,208
(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)

129
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,939
(Music)

130
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,509
It is very pink and very yellow.

131
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:02,676
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,

132
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:06,220
for example, these are two very well-known speeches.

133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,957
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"

134
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,409
and the other one is Hitler.

135
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,885
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls

136
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,461
without labels, and then I ask people,

137
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,308
"Which one do you prefer?"

138
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,573
And most people change their preference

139
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,484
when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler

140
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:27,604
and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.

141
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:33,343
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,

142
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,928
just like human vision.

143
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,523
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

144
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,605
But then, I just thought that

145
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:43,844
this human vision wasn't good enough.

146
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,055
There's many, many more colors around us

147
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,892
that we cannot perceive,

148
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,648
but that electronic eyes can perceive.

149
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:53,377
So I decided to continue extending my color senses,

150
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:57,627
and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet

151
00:07:57,627 --> 00:08:00,985
to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors

152
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,209
that the human eye cannot perceive.

153
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,656
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can

154
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:10,724
actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.

155
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,177
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.

156
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,327
And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that

157
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:22,292
you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,

158
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,449
because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,

159
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,433
a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish

160
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:31,394
to perceive things that we cannot perceive.

161
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,129
That's why, two years ago,

162
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,810
I created the Cyborg Foundation,

163
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,252
which is a foundation that tries to help people

164
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:39,949
become a cyborg, tries to encourage people

165
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,326
to extend their senses

166
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:44,397
by using technology as part of the body.

167
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:48,300
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,

168
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,276
so if we extend our senses,

169
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:53,364
we will consequently extend our knowledge.

170
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:56,157
I think life will be much more exciting

171
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:59,381
when we stop creating applications for mobile phones

172
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:02,782
and we start creating applications for our own body.

173
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:04,598
I think this will be a big, big change

174
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,676
that we will see during this century.

175
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:10,591
So I do encourage you all to think about which senses

176
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,010
you'd like to extend.

177
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,183
