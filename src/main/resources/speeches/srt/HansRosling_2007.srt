1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I told you three things last year.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I told you that the statistics of the world

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
have not been made properly available.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
Because of that, we still have the old mindset

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
And that animated graphics can make a difference.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
Things are changing

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,820
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
(Applause)

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
So three things have happened.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
U.N. opened their statistic databases,

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,820
and we have a new version of the software

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
up working as a beta on the net,

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
so you don't have to download it any longer.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
And let me repeat what you saw last year.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
The bubbles are the countries.

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,820
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
and there you have the length of life in years.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,820
those were developing countries.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
At that time there was a "we" and "them."

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
There was a huge difference in the world.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,820
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,820
And this is what happens.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,820
The blue there is India.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
a little more serious this year in showing you

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
how things really changed.

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?

33
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic

34
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
brought down the countries like this.

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
This is more or less what we saw last year,

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
and this is how it will go on into the future.

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
And I will talk on, is this possible?

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Because this is where we are.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Will it be possible that this will happen?

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
I cover my lifetime here, you know?

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
I expect to live 100 years.

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
And this is where we are today.

44
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?

45
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,820
And I would like to show that against child survival.

46
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
We'll swap the axis.

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
four kids dying there, 200 dying there.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
And this was 2007.

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,820
And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --

52
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,820
here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
Some countries still had statistics.

54
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
We are looking down in the archive,

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
and when we are down into 1820,

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,820
there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
(Laughter)

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.

60
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
How they got slowly richer and richer,

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,820
and they add statistics.

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?

64
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
You see the importance of that?

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
And here, children don't live longer.

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
because most of this statistics is Europe.

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
It was only by the turn of the century

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.

71
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,820
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.

73
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
not getting so rich.

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
It moves this way over here.

77
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
And the bubbles keep moving up there,

78
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and this is what the world looks like today.

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,820
(Applause)

80
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Let us have a look at the United States.

81
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --

83
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
And we can see that the United States

85
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
goes to the right of the mainstream.

86
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
They are on the money side all the time.

87
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,820
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
present, contemporary India.

89
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
And that means United States was richer,

90
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,820
but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy

93
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
as the United States during the First World War.

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,820
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while

95
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
to find the same health of the United States

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
as we have in the Philippines.

97
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
About 1957 here, the health of the United States

98
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
is the same as the Philippines.

99
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,

100
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,

101
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,820
are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
having human resources than they are economically.

103
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
There's a discrepancy in what's happening today

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
in the emerging economies.

105
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,820
There now, social benefits, social progress,

106
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
are going ahead of economical progress.

107
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,820
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.

108
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
And how long do we have to bring United States

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
to get the same health as Chile has today?

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --

111
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
the United States has the same health as Chile.

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
Chile's catching up!

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Within some years Chile may have better child survival

114
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
than the United States.

115
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
This is really a change, that you have this lag

116
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,820
of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.

117
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
And behind the health is the educational level.

118
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And there's a lot of infrastructure things,

119
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
and general human resources are there.

120
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Now we can take away this --

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and I would like to show you the rate of speed,

122
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
the rate of change, how fast they have gone.

123
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:31,820
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.

124
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.

125
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
And I'm going to stage a race here

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
between this sort of yellowish Ford here

127
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
and the red Toyota down there,

128
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
and the brownish Volvo.

129
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
(Laughter)

130
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And here we go. Here we go.

131
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,

132
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
and the United States Ford is going off-road there.

133
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.

134
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now

135
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --

136
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
can you see that?

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And they are taking over Sweden,

138
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
and they are now healthier than Sweden.

139
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.

140
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
(Laughter)

141
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,820
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.

142
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
They really caught up.

143
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
And this changes gradually.

144
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
We have to look over generations to understand it.

145
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,820
And let me show you my own sort of family history --

146
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
we made these graphs here.

147
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,820
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?

148
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
And this is my family.

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,820
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.

150
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.

151
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.

152
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And Sweden was like Mozambique.

153
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.

154
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
She took care of me as a child,

155
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
so I'm not talking about statistic now --

156
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
now it's oral history in my family.

157
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
That's when I believe statistics,

158
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
when it's grandma-verified statistics.

159
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
(Laughter)

160
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.

161
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Sweden was like Ghana.

162
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity

163
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
within sub-Saharan Africa.

164
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I told you last year, I'll tell you again,

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?

166
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I'm the Mexican in the family.

167
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
And my daughter, she was born in Chile,

168
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,

169
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
now the healthiest country on this Earth.

170
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,

171
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
with better child survival.

172
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
But they're very small, you know?

173
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
They're so close to the hospital we can never

174
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
beat them out in these forests.

175
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
(Laughter)

176
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
But homage to Singapore.

177
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Singapore is the best one.

178
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Now this looks also like a very good story.

179
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,820
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.

181
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,820
We can also make the color here represent the variable --

182
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
and what am I choosing here?

183
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.

184
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,820
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.

185
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
And China was emitting 0.6,

186
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,820
and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.

187
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
And what happens when we moved on?

188
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer

189
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
and getting healthier --

190
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,820
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.

191
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
There is no one who has done it so far.

192
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
And we don't have all the updated data

193
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
any longer, because this is really hot data today.

194
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
And there we are, 2001.

195
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,820
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,

196
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,820
many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,

197
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.

198
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
The Minister of the Environment of India said,

199
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."

200
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --

201
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
they were the ones who caused the climate change.

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.

203
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
But from now on, we count per capita.

204
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
From now on we count per capita.

205
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."

206
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
This really shows you, we have not seen good economic

207
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
and health progress anywhere in the world

208
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
without destroying the climate.

209
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And this is really what has to be changed.

210
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,

211
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
but I don't think it's like this.

212
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
The world is quite a messy place.

213
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
This we can call Dollar Street.

214
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Everyone lives on this street here.

215
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
What they earn here -- what number they live on --

216
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
is how much they earn per day.

217
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
This family earns about one dollar per day.

218
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
We drive up the street here,

219
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.

220
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,

221
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.

222
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
And how do they live?

223
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
If we look at the bed here, we can see

224
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
that they sleep on a rug on the floor.

225
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
This is what poverty line is --

226
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,

227
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
the food for the day.

228
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.

229
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.

230
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see

231
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
the sofa immediately here.

232
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
(Laughter)

233
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.

234
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,

235
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
you see the family still sitting on the floor there.

236
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Although there is a sofa,

237
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that

238
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,820
the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.

239
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
It comes beyond here, when you really can get

240
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
good working conditions in the family.

241
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
And if you really want to see the difference,

242
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
you look at the toilet over here.

243
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
This can change. This can change.

244
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
These are all pictures and images from Africa,

245
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
and it can become much better.

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
We can get out of poverty.

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.

248
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers

249
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
who were on the verge of famine.

250
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.

251
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
The nice thing here is that you can't see

252
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
who are the researchers in this picture.

253
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
That's when research functions in poor societies --

254
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
you must really live with the people.

255
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.

256
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
It's about having food.

257
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
And these two young farmers, they are girls now --

258
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --

259
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
they discuss with a trained agronomist.

260
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,

261
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --

262
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,820
the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.

263
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,

264
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
and that's to survive in poverty.

265
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,820
That's one context.

266
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Getting out of poverty.

267
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.

268
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.

269
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,

270
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."

271
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Technology will bring you out of poverty,

272
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.

273
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.

274
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling

275
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.

276
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market

277
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
and doesn't have to stay home.

278
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.

279
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
It's also good with credit.

280
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.

281
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.

282
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
You can do this.

283
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that

284
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
the seemingly impossible is possible.

285
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Africa has not done bad.

286
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation

287
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,

288
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
with a functioning nation and state.

289
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world

290
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
during the last 50 years.

291
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
Because we don't consider where they came from.

292
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
It's this stupid concept of developing countries

293
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,

294
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
and says that Mozambique did worse.

295
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
We have to know a little more about the world.

296
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.

297
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
He knows everything.

298
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.

299
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.

300
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
(Laughter)

301
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --

302
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
industrialized and developing.

303
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And I know 200, I know about the small data.

304
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
But you can do that.

305
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,820
(Applause)

306
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?

307
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
You make a PowerPoint, you know?

308
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,820
(Laughter)

309
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Homage to the Office package, no?

310
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?

311
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Everyone wants your pet thing.

313
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.

314
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,

315
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
you love equity between gender.

316
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.

317
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.

318
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
We need everything.

319
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
All these things are important for development,

320
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
especially when you just get out of poverty

321
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
and you should go towards welfare.

322
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Now, what we need to think about

323
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
is, what is a goal for development,

324
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
and what are the means for development?

325
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Let me first grade what are the most important means.

326
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,

327
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,820
is the most important thing for development

328
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
because it explains 80 percent of survival.

329
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Governance. To have a government which functions --

330
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,820
that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.

331
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
It was the government that made law function finally.

332
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Education, human resources are important.

333
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.

334
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Environment is important.

335
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.

336
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?

337
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
We are not interested in money.

338
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Money is not a goal.

339
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.

340
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,

341
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
but it's not a goal.

342
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.

343
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy

344
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.

345
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
And that's good, it gets two plusses.

346
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Environment is very, very crucial.

347
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.

348
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
But where are the important goals?

349
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Of course, it's human rights.

350
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Human rights is the goal,

351
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.

352
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,820
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,

353
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
because that's what brings joy to life.

354
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
That's the value of living.

355
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
So the seemingly impossible is possible.

356
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Even African countries can achieve this.

357
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,820
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.

358
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,820
And remember, please remember my main message,

359
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.

360
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
We can have a good world.

361
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,

362
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:11,820
and I think I will convince you also by culture.

363
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,820
(Laughter)

364
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
(Applause)

365
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Bring me my sword!

366
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.

367
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,820
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years

368
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,820
has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.

369
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
(Laughter)

370
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,820
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible

371
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --

372
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,820
this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,

373
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
in the last year we had war.

374
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.

375
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,820
And I'm going to take this blade of steel,

376
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,820
and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,

377
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,820
and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.

378
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?

379
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:51,820
(Applause)
