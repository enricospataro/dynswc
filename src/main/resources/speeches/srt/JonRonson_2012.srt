1
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:16,138
The story starts:
I was at a friend's house,

2
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:20,200
and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,436
which is the manual of mental disorders.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,730
It lists every known mental disorder.

5
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,787
And it used to be, back in the '50s,
a very slim pamphlet.

6
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,436
And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,542
and now it's 886 pages long.

8
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,910
And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.

9
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:40,652
So I was leafing through it,

10
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,593
wondering if I had any mental disorders,

11
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:45,278
and it turns out I've got 12.

12
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:46,453
(Laughter)

13
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:49,175
I've got generalized anxiety disorder,

14
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,445
which is a given.

15
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,485
I've got nightmare disorder,

16
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,874
which is categorized

17
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:57,938
if you have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure,

18
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:01,637
and all my dreams involve people
chasing me down the street

19
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,285
going, "You're a failure!"

20
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,092
(Laughter)

21
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:08,218
I've got parent-child relational problems,

22
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,187
which I blame my parents for.

23
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,106
(Laughter)

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,488
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.

25
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:15,662
I'm kidding.

26
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:17,684
And I've got malingering.

27
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,444
And I think it's actually quite rare

28
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:22,484
to have both malingering
and generalized anxiety disorder,

29
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:25,219
because malingering tends
to make me feel very anxious.

30
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:27,231
Anyway, I was looking through this book,

31
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,856
wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,413
or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder

33
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,563
if you're not a trained professional,

34
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:40,460
or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire

35
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:44,850
to label what's essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.

36
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:48,652
I didn't know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,

37
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,536
and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,944
to get their view,

39
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:56,306
which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.

40
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,566
(Laughter)

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,088
It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,380
who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.

43
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,393
They're called the CCHR.

44
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,368
And I said to him, "Can you prove to me

45
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:14,869
that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
that can't be trusted?"

46
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,659
And he said, "Yes,
we can prove it to you."

47
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,096
And I said, "How?"

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,905
And he said, "We're going
to introduce you to Tony."

49
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:24,164
And I said, "Who's Tony?"

50
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:28,103
And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."

51
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,437
Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.

52
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:35,095
It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

53
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,555
It's where they send the serial killers,

54
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,635
and the people who can't help themselves.

55
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,816
And I said to Brian,
"Well, what did Tony do?"

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,289
And he said, "Hardly anything.

57
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:48,926
He beat someone up or something,

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,045
and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.

59
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,582
But he faked it too well,
and now he's stuck in Broadmoor

60
00:02:58,606 --> 00:03:01,067
and nobody will believe he's sane.

61
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,828
Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"

62
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,064
So I said, "Yes, please."

63
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,730
So I got the train to Broadmoor.

64
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:12,849
I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,

65
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:15,255
which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,

66
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,532
they yawn uncontrollably.

67
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,832
And we got to Broadmoor.

68
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:23,731
And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate

69
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:27,252
into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.

70
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:30,714
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.

71
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:34,649
It's all peach and pine
and calming colors.

72
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:39,865
And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.

73
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,734
And the patients started drifting in.

74
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:47,549
And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,

75
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,232
and quite docile-looking.

76
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,995
And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,

77
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,929
"They're medicated,"

78
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:57,172
which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,

79
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,777
but I'm thinking
it's probably a good idea.

80
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,397
(Laughter)

81
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,980
And then Brian said, "Here's Tony."

82
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,498
And a man was walking in.

83
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:10,089
And he wasn't overweight,
he was in very good physical shape.

84
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,416
And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,

85
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,830
he was wearing a pinstripe suit.

86
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,850
And he had his arm outstretched

87
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,934
like someone out of The Apprentice.

88
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,240
He looked like a man
who wanted to wear an outfit

89
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:26,035
that would convince me
that he was very sane.

90
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:27,974
And he sat down.

91
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,903
And I said, "So is it true
that you faked your way in here?"

92
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:34,767
And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
I beat someone up when I was 17.

93
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,873
And I was in prison awaiting trial,

94
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,212
and my cellmate said to me,

95
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,720
'You know what you have to do?

96
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,119
Fake madness.

97
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:45,343
Tell them you're mad, you'll get
sent to some cushy hospital.

98
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:49,198
Nurses will bring you pizzas,
you'll have your own PlayStation.'"

99
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,914
I said, "Well, how did you do it?"

100
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:53,681
He said, "Well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.

101
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,992
And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'

102
00:04:56,016 --> 00:05:00,119
in which people get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.

103
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,092
So I said to the psychiatrist,

104
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:05,881
'I get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.'"

105
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,330
And I said, "What else?"

106
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,007
He said, "Oh, yeah.
I told the psychiatrist

107
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,315
that I wanted to watch women as they died,

108
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,504
because it would make
me feel more normal."

109
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:17,250
I said, "Where'd you get that from?"

110
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:20,058
He said, "Oh, from a biography
of Ted Bundy that they had

111
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:21,275
at the prison library."

112
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,536
Anyway, he faked madness
too well, he said.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,030
And they didn't send him
to some cushy hospital.

114
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:29,635
They sent him to Broadmoor.

115
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,696
And the minute he got there,

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,826
said he took one look at the place,
asked to see the psychiatrist,

117
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,368
said, "There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

118
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,801
I'm not mentally ill."

119
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:41,858
I said, "How long have you been here for?"

120
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:44,228
He said, "Well, if I'd just
done my time in prison

121
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:46,955
for the original crime,
I'd have got five years.

122
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,847
I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."

123
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:56,760
Tony said that it's a lot harder
to convince people you're sane

124
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,268
than it is to convince them you're crazy.

125
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,515
He said, "I thought
the best way to seem normal

126
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,159
would be to talk to people
normally about normal things

127
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,061
like football or what's on TV.

128
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:07,823
I subscribe to New Scientist,

129
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,514
and recently they had an article

130
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,898
about how the U.S. Army was training
bumblebees to sniff out explosives.

131
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,341
So I said to a nurse,

132
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,964
'Did you know that the U.S. Army
is training bumblebees

133
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,316
to sniff out explosives?'

134
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,862
When I read my medical notes,
I saw they'd written:

135
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:26,218
'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"

136
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:27,796
(Laughter)

137
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,927
He said, "You know, they're always
looking out for nonverbal clues

138
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,691
to my mental state.

139
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,352
But how do you sit in a sane way?

140
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,648
How do you cross your legs in a sane way?

141
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,180
It's just impossible."

142
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,753
When Tony said that to me,

143
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:44,286
I thought to myself,
"Am I sitting like a journalist?

144
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,976
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"

145
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:52,964
He said, "You know, I've got
the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,

146
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:55,377
and I've got the 'Tiptoe
Through the Tulips' rapist

147
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,768
on the other side of me.

148
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,241
So I tend to stay in my room a lot
because I find them quite frightening.

149
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:02,526
And they take that as a sign of madness.

150
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,065
They say it proves
that I'm aloof and grandiose."

151
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:10,309
So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
to hang out with serial killers

152
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,920
be a sign of madness.

153
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:15,020
Anyway, he seemed completely normal
to me, but what did I know?

154
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,554
And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.

155
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,152
I said, "What's the story?"

156
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,687
And he said, "Yep.
We accept that Tony faked madness

157
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:27,477
to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations --

158
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,652
that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with --

159
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:32,294
just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.

160
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,523
However, we have assessed him,

161
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,960
and we've determined that what he is

162
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,372
is a psychopath."

163
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,611
And in fact, faking madness

164
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:45,001
is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.

165
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,443
It's on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.

166
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,547
So, faking your brain going wrong

167
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:52,803
is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.

168
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:54,399
And I spoke to other experts,

169
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:58,362
and they said the pinstripe
suit -- classic psychopath --

170
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,664
speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:

171
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,032
glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.

172
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,141
And I said, "Well, but why didn't
he hang out with the other patients?"

173
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:12,095
Classic psychopath -- it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.

174
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,002
So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony

175
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:19,051
was evidence, according to his clinician,

176
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,899
that he was mad in this new way.

177
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,653
He was a psychopath.

178
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:26,202
And his clinician said to me, "If you
want to know more about psychopaths,

179
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:29,431
you can go on a psychopath-spotting course

180
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,342
run by Robert Hare, who invented
the psychopath checklist."

181
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:33,526
So I did.

182
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,593
I went on a psychopath-spotting course,

183
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:39,794
and I am now a certified --

184
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:44,077
and I have to say, extremely adept --
psychopath spotter.

185
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:47,999
So, here's the statistics:

186
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:52,145
One in a hundred regular people
is a psychopath.

187
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:56,648
So there's 1,500 people in his room.

188
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:59,715
Fifteen of you are psychopaths.

189
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:06,633
Although that figure rises to four percent
of CEOs and business leaders,

190
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:09,392
so I think there's a very good chance

191
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:14,530
there's about 30 or 40
psychopaths in this room.

192
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,988
It could be carnage
by the end of the night.

193
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:21,468
(Laughter)

194
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:26,388
Hare said the reason why
is because capitalism at its most ruthless

195
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:29,056
rewards psychopathic behavior --

196
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,017
the lack of empathy, the glibness,

197
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,399
cunning, manipulative.

198
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:39,388
In fact, capitalism, perhaps
at its most remorseless,

199
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,191
is a physical manifestation
of psychopathy.

200
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:48,790
It's like a form of psychopathy
that's come down to affect us all.

201
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,998
Hare said, "You know what?
Forget about some guy at Broadmoor

202
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,837
who may or may not have faked madness.

203
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,482
Who cares? That's not a big story.

204
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,399
The big story," he said,
"is corporate psychopathy.

205
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:02,254
You want to go and interview yourself
some corporate psychopaths."

206
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,959
So I gave it a try.
I wrote to the Enron people.

207
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:08,329
I said, "Could I come
and interview you in prison,

208
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,123
to find out it you're psychopaths?"

209
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,377
(Laughter)

210
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,677
And they didn't reply.

211
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,251
(Laughter)

212
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,172
So I changed tack.

213
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:19,472
I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,

214
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:23,035
the asset stripper from the 1990s.

215
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,266
He would come into failing businesses

216
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,325
and close down 30 percent
of the workforce,

217
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:30,493
just turn American towns into ghost towns.

218
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:31,970
And I emailed him and I said,

219
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:34,788
"I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly

220
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,823
that makes you ... special,

221
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:41,208
and interested in the predatory
spirit, and fearless.

222
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:44,684
Can I come and interview you
about your special brain anomaly?"

223
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,526
And he said, "Come on over!"

224
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,911
(Laughter)

225
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,987
So I went to Al Dunlap's
grand Florida mansion.

226
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:55,719
It was filled with sculptures
of predatory animals.

227
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:59,721
There were lions and tigers --
he was taking me through the garden --

228
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,437
there were falcons and eagles,

229
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,965
he was saying, "Over there
you've got sharks and --"

230
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,202
he was saying this
in a less effeminate way --

231
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:11,428
"You've got more sharks
and you've got tigers."

232
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,626
It was like Narnia.

233
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,128
(Laughter)

234
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,798
And then we went into his kitchen.

235
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:24,744
Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
to save failing companies,

236
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,191
he'd close down 30 percent
of the workforce.

237
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:30,394
And he'd quite often
fire people with a joke.

238
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,763
Like, for instance,
one famous story about him,

239
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:36,239
somebody came up to him and said,
"I've just bought myself a new car."

240
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,271
And he said, "Well,
you may have a new car,

241
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:41,800
but I'll tell you what you
don't have -- a job."

242
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:44,518
So in his kitchen --

243
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,500
he was in there with his wife, Judy,
and his bodyguard, Sean --

244
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,580
and I said, "You know
how I said in my email

245
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:53,240
that you might have a special brain
anomaly that makes you special?"

246
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:56,166
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing
theory, it's like Star Trek.

247
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,402
You're going where
no man has gone before."

248
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,530
And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)

249
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,883
(Laughter)

250
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,070
Some psychologists might say

251
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:08,772
that this makes you --"
(Mumbles)

252
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,423
(Laughter)

253
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,921
And he said, "What?"

254
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:13,965
And I said, "A psychopath."

255
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:18,368
And I said, "I've got a list
of psychopathic traits in my pocket.

256
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,551
Can I go through them with you?"

257
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:23,306
And he looked intrigued despite himself,

258
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,705
and he said, "Okay, go on."

259
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:28,112
And I said, "Okay.
Grandiose sense of self-worth."

260
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,912
Which I have to say, would
have been hard for him to deny,

261
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:34,320
because he was standing
under a giant oil painting of himself.

262
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:38,495
(Laughter)

263
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,552
He said, "Well, you've
got to believe in you!"

264
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:44,464
And I said, "Manipulative."

265
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,181
He said, "That's leadership."

266
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,206
(Laughter)

267
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,636
And I said, "Shallow affect,

268
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,932
an inability to experience
a range of emotions."

269
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:55,562
He said, "Who wants to be weighed
down by some nonsense emotions?"

270
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,757
So he was going down
the psychopath checklist,

271
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:00,982
basically turning it
into "Who Moved My Cheese?"

272
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,098
(Laughter)

273
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:07,542
But I did notice something happening
to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.

274
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:10,463
Whenever he said anything to me
that was kind of normal --

275
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:13,430
like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,

276
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,360
he said he got accepted into West Point,

277
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,239
and they don't let
delinquents in West Point.

278
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,979
He said "no" to many short-term
marital relationships.

279
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,663
He's only ever been married twice.

280
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:25,634
Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers

281
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,098
that he once threatened her with a knife

282
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:30,839
and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,

283
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,905
but people say stupid things to each other

284
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,984
in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,

285
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:38,029
and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.

286
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:41,751
So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,

287
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,918
I thought to myself, well I'm not
going to put that in my book.

288
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:48,732
And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter

289
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:52,232
had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.

290
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:57,200
Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked "Psychopath."

291
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:01,934
I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.

292
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,160
And I realized, my God --

293
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,187
this is what I've been doing for 20 years.

294
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,833
It's what all journalists do.

295
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:10,317
We travel across the world
with our notepads in our hands,

296
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,136
and we wait for the gems.

297
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:17,135
And the gems are always
the outermost aspects

298
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,788
of our interviewee's personality.

299
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:22,286
And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,

300
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,837
and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.

301
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,766
And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses

302
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,067
certain mental disorders hugely.

303
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,433
Childhood bipolar --

304
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,012
children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar

305
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,466
because they have temper tantrums,

306
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,204
which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.

307
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,056
When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.

308
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:52,030
He said, "Why haven't you
been returning my calls?"

309
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:55,403
I said, "Well, they say
that you're a psychopath."

310
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,381
And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."

311
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:58,564
He said, "You know what?

312
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:01,260
One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,

313
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:04,145
but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.

314
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,535
So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,

315
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,299
they say, 'Typical of the psychopath

316
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,700
to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn't.'

317
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:14,792
It's like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down."

318
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:18,376
He said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.

319
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
Will you come to it?"

320
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,717
So I said okay.

321
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:23,827
So I went to his tribunal.

322
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,603
And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.

323
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:32,466
They decided that he shouldn't
be held indefinitely

324
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,180
because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean

325
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:40,735
that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.

326
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,950
So they let him go.

327
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,995
And outside in the corridor he said to me,

328
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,174
"You know what, Jon?

329
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,624
Everyone's a bit psychopathic."

330
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,707
He said, "You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am."

331
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,848
I said, "What are you going to do now?"

332
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,055
He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.

333
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,757
There's a woman there that I fancy.

334
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,736
But she's married, so I'm going to have
to get her split up from her husband."

335
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,517
(Laughter)

336
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,928
Anyway, that was two years ago,

337
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,530
and that's where my book ended.

338
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,116
And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.

339
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,181
Nothing bad happened.

340
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:21,344
He was living with a girl outside London.

341
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,466
He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,

342
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,516
making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,

343
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,096
but isn't necessarily ominous.

344
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:30,679
Unfortunately, after 20 months,

345
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:33,413
he did go back to jail for a month.

346
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:37,593
He got into a "fracas"
in a bar, he called it.

347
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,565
Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,

348
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,477
but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,

349
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,106
it wasn't too bad.

350
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,450
And then he phoned me.

351
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,858
And you know what, I think
it's right that Tony is out.

352
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,873
Because you shouldn't define
people by their maddest edges.

353
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,733
And what Tony is,
is he's a semi-psychopath.

354
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:06,882
He's a gray area in a world
that doesn't like gray areas.

355
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:11,613
But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.

356
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:15,033
It's where you find the humanity,

357
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,931
and it's where you find the truth.

358
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,049
And Tony said to me,

359
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,945
"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?

360
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:27,269
I just want to thank you
for everything you've done for me."

361
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:28,584
And I didn't go.

362
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,314
What would you have done?

363
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,673
Thank you.

364
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:40,344
(Applause)
