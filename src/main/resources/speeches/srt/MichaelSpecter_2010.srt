1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
and it's a time machine.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
And everyone in this room has to get into it.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
you cannot stay where you are.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
or Twitter or "American Idol."

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I don't know.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
And I understand that.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
It's because possibilities on this planet,

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
they don't go back, they go forward.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
by any measure that you wish to choose:

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
health, wealth,

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
mobility, opportunity,

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
declining rates of disease ...

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
There's never been a time like this.

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
My great-grandparents died, all of them,

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
by the time they were 60.

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
My parents are closing in on 80.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
So there better be

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
a nine at the beginning of my death number.

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
But it's not even about people like us,

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
because this is a bigger deal than that.

34
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
A kid born in New Delhi today

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
can expect to live as long as

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.

38
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
And why is it true?

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
of people on this planet.

41
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
It reshaped the demography of the globe

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
in a way that no war ever has.

43
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
It's gone. It's vanished.

44
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
We vanquished it. Puff.

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
In the rich world,

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
no longer exist, hardly.

48
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
does anyone even know what those things are?

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Vaccines, modern medicine,

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
our ability to feed billions of people,

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
those are triumphs of the scientific method.

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
And to my mind, the scientific method --

54
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
trying stuff out,

55
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --

56
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.

57
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
So that's the good news.

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Unfortunately, that's all the good news

59
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.

60
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
And one of them is that

61
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
despite all our accomplishments,

62
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
a billion people go to bed hungry

63
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
in this world every day.

64
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And not only that, we've used our imagination

66
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
to thoroughly trash this globe.

67
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
Potable water, arable land,

68
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
rainforests, oil, gas:

69
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
they're going away, and they're going away soon,

70
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,

71
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
we're going away too.

72
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.

73
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
I think it's clear that we can make food

74
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.

75
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
I think we can power this world with energy

76
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
that doesn't also destroy it.

77
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.

78
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --

79
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
one of the things that keeps me up at night:

80
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.

81
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
And we've also never been in a position

82
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.

83
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events

84
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
in many fields,

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back

86
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,

87
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
to find a time when we battled progress,

88
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
when we fought about these things

89
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.

90
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
People wrap themselves in their beliefs,

91
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Not even the truth will set them free.

93
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.

95
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
But you know what you're not entitled to?

96
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.

97
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
And this took me awhile to figure out.

98
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines

99
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
for The New Yorker. A little story.

100
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And I was amazed to find opposition:

101
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
opposition to what is, after all,

102
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
the most effective public health measure in human history.

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I didn't know what to do,

104
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And soon after that,

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.

107
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Same thing, only bigger.

108
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
People were going crazy.

109
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
So I wrote a story about that too,

110
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
and I couldn't understand why

111
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"

112
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
why they thought moving molecules around

113
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
was trespassing on nature's ground.

115
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
I mean, I'm a journalist.

117
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.

118
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
(Laughter)

119
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
But these stories bothered me,

120
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.

121
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
weren't actually fanatics at all.

123
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.

124
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
They were exactly like the people in this room.

125
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
And it just disturbed me so much.

126
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.

127
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
We're at a point in this world

128
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.

129
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
We talk about it ambivalently.

130
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:

131
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
"progress."

132
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.

133
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
We've lost faith in institutions,

134
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
in authority,

135
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
and sometimes in science itself,

136
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
and there's no reason we shouldn't have.

137
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
You can just say a few names

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
and people will understand.

139
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,

140
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,

141
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
hanging chads.

142
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
You know, you can choose your list.

143
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
There are questions and problems

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
with the people we used to believe were always right,

145
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
so be skeptical.

146
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.

147
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Don't take anything for granted.

148
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
But here's the thing: When you get proof,

149
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.

150
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
And the reason that I can say that is because

151
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
we're now in an epidemic of fear

152
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.

153
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
About 12 years ago, there was a story published,

154
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
a horrible story,

155
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
that linked the epidemic of autism

156
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.

157
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
Very scary.

158
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.

159
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.

160
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
The data came back.

161
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
The data came back from the United States, from England,

162
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
from Sweden, from Canada,

163
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and it was all the same: no correlation,

164
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
no connection, none at all.

165
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter

166
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
because we believe anecdotes,

167
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
we believe what we see, what we think we see,

168
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
what makes us feel real.

169
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We don't believe a bunch of documents

170
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
from a government official giving us data,

171
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and I do understand that, I think we all do.

172
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
But you know what?

173
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
The result of that has been disastrous.

174
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Disastrous because here's a fact:

175
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
The United States is one of the only countries in the world

176
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.

177
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
That is disgraceful,

178
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
and we should be ashamed of ourselves.

179
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
It's horrible.

180
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
What kind of a thing happened

181
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
that we could do that?

182
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.

183
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
Because, did anyone have measles here?

184
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?

185
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Doesn't happen very much.

186
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Doesn't happen in this country at all,

187
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.

188
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
That's a lot of death of measles --

189
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
20 an hour.

190
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,

191
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
and people like Jenny McCarthy

192
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
can go around preaching messages

193
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
of fear and illiteracy from platforms

194
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."

195
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And they can do it because

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
they don't link causation and correlation.

197
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
They don't understand that these things seem the same,

198
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
but they're almost never the same.

199
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.

200
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.

201
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.

202
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.

203
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
That guy in the middle, not so much.

204
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
His name is Paul Offit.

205
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.

206
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids

207
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
in the developing world every year.

208
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Pretty good, right?

209
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines

210
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and says how valuable they are

211
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
and that people ought to just stop the whining.

212
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
And he actually says it that way.

213
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
So, Paul's a terrorist.

214
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
When Paul speaks in a public hearing,

215
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
he can't testify without armed guards.

216
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
He gets called at home

217
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
because people like to tell him

218
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
that they remember where his kids go to school.

219
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.

220
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
You take them away, disease comes back,

222
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
horrible diseases. And that's happening.

223
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
We have measles in this country now.

224
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids

225
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.

226
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And they're not just going to die of measles.

227
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?

228
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said

229
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
she thought I was a little strident.

230
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
No one's ever said that before.

231
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
no way.

233
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Fine.

234
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?

235
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.

236
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,

237
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.

238
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,

239
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
and he's going to come to Long Beach,

240
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.

241
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,

242
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
and we don't either because that's the way the world works.

243
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.

244
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.

245
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?

246
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Echinacea, a little antioxidant

247
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
to get you going.

248
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.

249
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,

250
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
and it doesn't matter how often

251
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
we find out that they're useless.

252
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
The data says it all the time.

253
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.

254
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
(Laughter)

255
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?

256
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I'm totally with you.

257
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
(Laughter)

258
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Dark urine. Dark.

259
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?

260
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.

261
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.

262
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.

263
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
It's cruel to millions of people.

264
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
It's absolutely astonishingly cold

265
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.

266
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
So we run away from it, and where do we run?

267
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.

268
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
(Laughter)

269
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.

270
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,820
(Applause)

271
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
But, you know, it's really a serious thing

272
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
because this stuff is crap,

273
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
and we spend billions of dollars on it.

274
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
And I have all sorts of little props here.

275
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;

276
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
echinacea, fraud;

277
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
acai -- I don't even know what that is

278
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.

279
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,

280
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.

281
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
It makes them feel good."

282
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
And you know what? You're wrong.

283
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Because I don't care

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
if it's the secretary of HHS

285
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence

286
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
of my experts on mammograms,"

287
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient

288
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
with coffee enemas.

289
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
When you start down the road

290
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
where belief and magic replace evidence and science,

291
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
you end up in a place you don't want to be.

292
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.

293
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
He killed 400,000 of his people

294
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
by insisting that beetroot,

295
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
garlic and lemon oil

296
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs

297
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
we know can slow the course of AIDS.

298
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths

299
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
in a country that has been plagued

300
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
worse than any other by this disease.

301
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Please, don't tell me

302
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
there are no consequences to these things.

303
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
There are. There always are.

304
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Now, the most mindless epidemic

305
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
we're in the middle of right now

306
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
is this absurd battle

307
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
between proponents of genetically engineered food

308
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
and the organic elite.

309
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.

310
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.

311
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
It's ideology, it's not science.

312
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,

313
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
every sprig of parsley,

314
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
every Brussels sprout

315
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
has been modified by man.

316
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.

317
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)

318
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.

319
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
We made it over the last 11,000 years.

320
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.

321
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.

322
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Now we can do it in a more precise way --

323
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
and there are risks, absolutely --

324
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,

325
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
and that stuff can help millions of people,

326
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
millions of people, prolong their lives.

327
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
You don't want to do that?

328
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I have to say, I don't understand it.

329
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
We object to genetically engineered food.

330
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Why do we do that?

331
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Well, the things I constantly hear are:

332
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Too many chemicals,

333
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
pesticides, hormones,

334
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
monoculture, we don't want giant fields

335
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
of the same thing, that's wrong.

336
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
We don't companies patenting life.

337
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
We don't want companies owning seeds.

338
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
And you know what my response to all of that is?

339
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.

340
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
It's true, we've got a huge food problem,

341
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
but this isn't science.

342
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
This has nothing to do with science.

343
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.

344
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
You know science isn't a company.

345
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
It's not a country.

346
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
It's not even an idea; it's a process.

347
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,

348
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
but the idea that we should not allow

349
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
science to do its job

350
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
because we're afraid,

351
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
is really very deadening,

352
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
and it's preventing millions of people

353
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
from prospering.

354
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
You know, in the next 50 years

355
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,

356
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
70 percent.

357
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.

358
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.

359
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.

360
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And why? Genetically engineered food.

361
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
We don't want to encourage people

362
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.

363
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.

364
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
It's kind of like a potato.

365
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.

366
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,

367
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and scientists are engineering

368
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
all of that into it right now.

369
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.

370
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
They wouldn't starve, and you know what?

371
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,

372
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
but it would be nice.

373
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
And all I can say about this is:

374
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Why are we fighting it?

375
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?

376
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Because we don't want to move genes around?

377
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.

378
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,

379
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
our insistence on having bigger food,

380
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
better food, singular food.

381
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
This isn't about Rice Krispies,

382
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
this is about keeping people alive,

383
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.

384
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Because, you know something?

385
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,

386
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:

387
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
high-tech colonialism.

388
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.

389
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
It's selfish, it's ugly,

390
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
it's beneath us,

391
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
and we really have to stop it.

392
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
So after this amazingly fun conversation,

393
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
(Laughter)

394
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this

395
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
ridiculous time machine and go forward?"

396
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.

397
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
It's stuck in the present right now,

398
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
but we have an amazing opportunity.

399
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
We can set that time machine on anything we want.

400
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
We can move it where we want to move it,

401
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
and we're going to move it where we want to move it.

402
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
We have to have these conversations and we have to think,

403
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,

404
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
we're going to be happy we do.

405
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I know that we can,

406
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
and as far as I'm concerned,

407
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
that's something the world needs right now.

408
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
(Applause)

409
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Thank you.

410
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Thank you.

411
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Thank you. Thank you.
