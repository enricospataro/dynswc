1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,556
"When the crisis came,

2
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,676
the serious limitations of existing economic

3
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:22,728
and financial models immediately became apparent."

4
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:27,710
"There is also a strong belief, which I share,

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,709
that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics

6
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,110
helped create the crisis."

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,377
Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticism

8
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:40,719
coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism.

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,396
But this is different.

10
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:46,264
This is coming from the heart of finance.

11
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:49,125
The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:53,000
when he was governor of the European Central Bank.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,239
The second quote is from the head

14
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,604
of the U.K. Financial Services Authority.

15
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,134
Are these people implying

16
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:02,929
that we don't understand the economic systems

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,069
that drive our modern societies?

18
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,991
It gets worse.

19
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,146
"We spend billions of dollars

20
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:13,370
trying to understand the origins of the universe

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,232
while we still don't understand the conditions

22
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:25,958
for a stable society, a functioning economy, or peace."

23
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,793
What's happening here? How can this be possible?

24
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,749
Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality

25
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,412
than we do about the fabric

26
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:36,550
which emerges from our human interactions?

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,077
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

28
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:42,486
But there's an intriguing solution which is coming

29
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:46,974
from what is known as the science of complexity.

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,817
To explain what this means and what this thing is,

31
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:53,396
please let me quickly take a couple of steps back.

32
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:55,786
I ended up in physics by accident.

33
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:58,877
It was a random encounter when I was young,

34
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,982
and since then, I've often wondered

35
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:03,061
about the amazing success of physics

36
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:07,428
in describing the reality we wake up in every day.

37
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:10,724
In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.

38
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:13,757
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand

39
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:17,526
and you translate it into mathematics.

40
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:20,962
You encode it into equations.

41
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:24,789
Then predictions can be made and tested.

42
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,353
We're actually really lucky that this works,

43
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:30,368
because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads

44
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:35,945
should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe.

45
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:39,507
Despite the success, physics has its limits.

46
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:42,229
As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote,

47
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,723
we don't really understand the complexity

48
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:47,901
that relates to us, that surrounds us.

49
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,549
This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems.

50
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,453
So these are systems which are made up

51
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,933
of many interconnected or interacting parts:

52
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:01,747
swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies,

53
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:05,181
ecosystems, brains, financial markets.

54
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:09,507
These are just a few examples.

55
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:14,750
Interestingly, complex systems are very hard to map

56
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,610
into mathematical equations,

57
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,103
so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.

58
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:23,296
So what do we know about complex systems?

59
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:27,238
Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior

60
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,257
from the outside is actually the result

61
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:34,454
of a few simple rules of interaction.

62
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:38,679
This means you can forget about the equations

63
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,542
and just start to understand the system

64
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,246
by looking at the interactions,

65
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:45,566
so you can actually forget about the equations

66
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,039
and you just start to look at the interactions.

67
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,276
And it gets even better, because most complex systems

68
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,344
have this amazing property called emergence.

69
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,750
So this means that the system as a whole

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,485
suddenly starts to show a behavior

71
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,629
which cannot be understood or predicted

72
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,206
by looking at the components of the system.

73
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:08,125
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts.

74
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,471
And all of this also means that you can forget about

75
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:15,820
the individual parts of the system, how complex they are.

76
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,733
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,

77
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:25,082
you just focus on the rules of interaction.

78
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:29,528
As a result, networks are ideal representations

79
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:32,182
of complex systems.

80
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:34,953
The nodes in the network

81
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,712
are the system's components

82
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:41,912
and the links are given by the interactions.

83
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:44,737
So what equations are for physics,

84
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:49,352
complex networks are for the study of complex systems.

85
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:52,576
This approach has been very successfully applied

86
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:55,839
to many complex systems in physics, biology,

87
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,080
computer science, the social sciences,

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,377
but what about economics?

89
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,795
Where are economic networks?

90
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:08,392
This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.

91
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,946
The study we published last year called

92
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:14,272
"The Network of Global Corporate Control"

93
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:20,202
was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.

94
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,896
The study went viral on the Internet

95
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:27,968
and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.

96
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,679
This is quite remarkable, because, again,

97
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,100
why did no one look at this before?

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,392
Similar data has been around for quite some time.

99
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:39,032
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks.

100
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:44,472
So here the nodes are companies, people, governments,

101
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:48,024
foundations, etc.

102
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:50,852
And the links represent the shareholding relations,

103
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:56,040
so Shareholder A has x percent of the shares in Company B.

104
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,312
And we also assign a value to the company

105
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:01,349
given by the operating revenue.

106
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,448
So ownership networks reveal the patterns

107
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,969
of shareholding relations.

108
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,152
In this little example, you can see

109
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,272
a few financial institutions

110
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:15,665
with some of the many links highlighted.

111
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,345
Now you may think that no one's looked at this before

112
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,681
because ownership networks are

113
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,808
really, really boring to study.

114
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:27,672
Well, as ownership is related to control,

115
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:29,268
as I shall explain later,

116
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,626
looking at ownership networks

117
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,184
actually can give you answers to questions like,

118
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,024
who are the key players?

119
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:37,216
How are they organized? Are they isolated?

120
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,704
Are they interconnected?

121
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:42,579
And what is the overall distribution of control?

122
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,055
In other words, who controls the world?

123
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,424
I think this is an interesting question.

124
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:52,512
And it has implications for systemic risk.

125
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:57,522
This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall.

126
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:00,385
A high degree of interconnectivity

127
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,252
can be bad for stability,

128
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,696
because then the stress can spread through the system

129
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,648
like an epidemic.

130
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:12,464
Scientists have sometimes criticized economists

131
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,792
who believe ideas and concepts

132
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,803
are more important than empirical data,

133
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:20,952
because a foundational guideline in science is:

134
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:24,288
Let the data speak. Okay. Let's do that.

135
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,882
So we started with a database containing

136
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:31,025
13 million ownership relations from 2007.

137
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,882
This is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out

138
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,440
who rules the world,

139
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,272
we decided to focus on transnational corporations,

140
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,620
or TNCs for short.

141
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,216
These are companies that operate in more than one country,

142
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,824
and we found 43,000.

143
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:51,776
In the next step, we built the network around these companies,

144
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:54,224
so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,

145
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,316
and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,

146
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:59,192
all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream,

147
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:03,233
and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes

148
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,662
and one million links.

149
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:08,512
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.

150
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:11,040
And it turns out to be structured as follows.

151
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,755
So you have a periphery and a center

152
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:18,232
which contains about 75 percent of all the players,

153
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,760
and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core

154
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,584
which is made up of highly interconnected companies.

155
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:29,019
To give you a better picture,

156
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,630
think about a metropolitan area.

157
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,921
So you have the suburbs and the periphery,

158
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:35,618
you have a center like a financial district,

159
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,361
then the core will be something like

160
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,800
the tallest high rise building in the center.

161
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,675
And we already see signs of organization going on here.

162
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:51,408
Thirty-six percent of the TNCs are in the core only,

163
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:55,779
but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue

164
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,360
of all TNCs.

165
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Okay, so now we analyzed the structure,

166
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,762
so how does this relate to the control?

167
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:08,689
Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders.

168
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:11,408
This is the normal notion of control.

169
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:14,615
And there are different models which allow you to compute

170
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,396
the control you get from ownership.

171
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:20,176
If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company,

172
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:21,800
you get control,

173
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,976
but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares.

174
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:29,865
And the network really matters.

175
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,496
About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera

176
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:35,900
had ownership and control in a small company,

177
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,352
which had ownership and control in a bigger company.

178
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,831
You get the idea.

179
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,094
This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia

180
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:47,727
with a leverage of 26.

181
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:51,670
So this means that, with each euro he invested,

182
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,355
he was able to move 26 euros of market value

183
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,731
through the chain of ownership relations.

184
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,811
Now what we actually computed in our study

185
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,510
was the control over the TNCs' value.

186
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,362
This allowed us to assign a degree of influence

187
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:10,669
to each shareholder.

188
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,251
This is very much in the sense of

189
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:16,363
Max Weber's idea of potential power,

190
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:20,175
which is the probability of imposing one's own will

191
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:24,170
despite the opposition of others.

192
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,813
If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network,

193
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,061
this is what you have to do.

194
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:32,606
It's actually not that hard to understand.

195
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,374
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.

196
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,229
So think about water flowing in pipes

197
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,411
where the pipes have different thickness.

198
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:46,155
So similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks

199
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:50,574
and is accumulating at the nodes.

200
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:54,522
So what did we find after computing all this network control?

201
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:59,909
Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders

202
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,701
have the potential to collectively control

203
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:06,961
80 percent of the TNCs' value.

204
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:10,277
Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes,

205
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:14,054
so these 737 top players

206
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:17,877
make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.

207
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:22,833
They're mostly financial institutions in the U.S. and the U.K.

208
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,381
And it gets even more extreme.

209
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,678
There are 146 top players in the core,

210
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:33,898
and they together have the potential to collectively control

211
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:39,253
40 percent of the TNCs' value.

212
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:42,049
What should you take home from all of this?

213
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:45,637
Well, the high degree of control you saw

214
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:50,527
is very extreme by any standard.

215
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:53,077
The high degree of interconnectivity

216
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:55,389
of the top players in the core

217
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,566
could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy

218
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:04,286
and we could easily reproduce the TNC network

219
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:06,237
with a few simple rules.

220
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,717
This means that its structure is probably the result

221
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,357
of self-organization.

222
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:13,673
It's an emergent property which depends

223
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:16,517
on the rules of interaction in the system,

224
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:19,963
so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach

225
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:23,389
like a global conspiracy.

226
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,322
Our study "is an impression of the moon's surface.

227
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:27,651
It's not a street map."

228
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,290
So you should take the exact numbers in our study

229
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,730
with a grain of salt,

230
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,122
yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse

231
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:39,466
of a brave new world of finance."

232
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:43,906
We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction,

233
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:48,643
so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future.

234
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,088
And this is slowly starting.

235
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:53,080
We're seeing the emergence of long-term

236
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,650
and highly-funded programs which aim at understanding

237
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,340
our networked world from a complexity point of view.

238
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,378
But this journey has only just begun,

239
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:08,816
so we will have to wait before we see the first results.

240
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:12,434
Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion.

241
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:17,586
Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics,

242
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:20,866
society, are very often tainted

243
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,682
by people's personal ideologies.

244
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:28,820
I really hope that this complexity perspective

245
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,963
allows for some common ground to be found.

246
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:36,882
It would be really great if it has the power

247
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:41,945
to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas,

248
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:47,075
which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.

249
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:51,741
Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma.

250
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:54,627
But this is just my own personal ideology.

251
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,662
Thank you.

252
00:13:56,662 --> 00:14:01,339
