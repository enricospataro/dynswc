1
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,478
I need to make a confession
at the outset here.

2
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:20,255
A little over 20 years ago,
I did something that I regret,

3
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,002
something that I'm not
particularly proud of.

4
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:28,076
Something that, in many ways,
I wish no one would ever know,

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,359
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.

6
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:32,403
(Laughter)

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,684
In the late 1980s,

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,103
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,

9
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,628
I went to law school.

10
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:42,590
(Laughter)

11
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,763
In America, law is a professional degree:

12
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:50,492
after your university degree,
you go on to law school.

13
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:51,956
When I got to law school,

14
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,090
I didn't do very well.

15
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,324
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.

16
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,355
I, in fact, graduated in the part
of my law school class

17
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,796
that made the top 90% possible.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,042
(Laughter)

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,868
Thank you.

20
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:14,200
I never practiced law a day in my life;

21
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:16,208
I pretty much wasn't allowed to.

22
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:17,829
(Laughter)

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,451
But today, against my better judgment,

24
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:24,796
against the advice of my own wife,

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,796
I want to try to dust off
some of those legal skills --

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,179
what's left of those legal skills.

27
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,949
I don't want to tell you a story.

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,184
I want to make a case.

29
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,574
I want to make a hard-headed,

30
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,796
evidence-based,

31
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,994
dare I say lawyerly case,

32
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:45,767
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

33
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,598
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

34
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:51,065
take a look at this.

35
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,396
This is called the candle problem.

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,094
Some of you might know it.

37
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,796
It's created in 1945

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,796
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,796
He created this experiment

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,951
that is used in many other experiments
in behavioral science.

41
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,796
And here's how it works.
Suppose I'm the experimenter.

42
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,440
I bring you into a room.

43
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:12,688
I give you a candle,
some thumbtacks and some matches.

44
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:13,783
And I say to you,

45
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,796
"Your job is to attach
the candle to the wall

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,946
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."

47
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,505
Now what would you do?

48
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:25,124
Many people begin trying
to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

49
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,486
Doesn't work.

50
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,240
I saw somebody
kind of make the motion over here --

51
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,368
some people have a great idea
where they light the match,

52
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:37,321
melt the side of the candle,
try to adhere it to the wall.

53
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:39,440
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.

54
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,796
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,796
most people figure out the solution,

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,565
which you can see here.

57
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:50,379
The key is to overcome
what's called functional fixedness.

58
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,367
You look at that box and you see it
only as a receptacle for the tacks.

59
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,397
But it can also have this other function,

60
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,683
as a platform for the candle.

61
00:02:58,707 --> 00:02:59,796
The candle problem.

62
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,791
I want to tell you about an experiment
using the candle problem,

63
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,274
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

64
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,419
who is now at Princeton University, US,

65
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:11,796
This shows the power of incentives.

66
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,796
He gathered his participants and said:

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,645
"I'm going to time you, how quickly
you can solve this problem."

68
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,145
To one group he said,

69
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,796
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,361
averages for how long it typically takes
someone to solve this sort of problem."

71
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:28,796
To the second group he offered rewards.

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,543
He said, "If you're in the top 25%
of the fastest times,

73
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,575
you get five dollars.

74
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:39,287
If you're the fastest of everyone
we're testing here today,

75
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,796
you get 20 dollars."

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,703
Now this is several years ago,
adjusted for inflation,

77
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,272
it's a decent sum of money
for a few minutes of work.

78
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,796
It's a nice motivator.

79
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,963
Question:

80
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:52,304
How much faster did this group
solve the problem?

81
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:54,443
Answer:

82
00:03:54,467 --> 00:04:00,109
It took them, on average,
three and a half minutes longer.

83
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,348
3.5 min longer.

84
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,194
This makes no sense, right?

85
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:06,321
I mean, I'm an American.
I believe in free markets.

86
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,796
That's not how it's supposed
to work, right?

87
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,004
(Laughter)

88
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:13,943
If you want people to perform better,
you reward them. Right?

89
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,796
Bonuses, commissions,
their own reality show.

90
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,838
Incentivize them.

91
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:21,065
That's how business works.

92
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,102
But that's not happening here.

93
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:24,796
You've got an incentive designed

94
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,616
to sharpen thinking
and accelerate creativity,

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,796
and it does just the opposite.

96
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,796
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

97
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,751
What's interesting about this experiment

98
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,345
is that it's not an aberration.

99
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,454
This has been replicated
over and over again

100
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,496
for nearly 40 years.

101
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,796
These contingent motivators --

102
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,194
if you do this, then you get that --

103
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,796
work in some circumstances.

104
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,632
But for a lot of tasks,
they actually either don't work

105
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:55,552
or, often, they do harm.

106
00:04:56,508 --> 00:05:01,397
This is one of the most robust findings
in social science,

107
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,954
and also one of the most ignored.

108
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,568
I spent the last couple of years

109
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,663
looking at the science
of human motivation,

110
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,049
particularly the dynamics
of extrinsic motivators

111
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:12,796
and intrinsic motivators.

112
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,232
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.

113
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,594
If you look at the science,
there is a mismatch

114
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,471
between what science knows

115
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,906
and what business does.

116
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,176
What's alarming here
is that our business operating system --

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,508
think of the set of assumptions
and protocols beneath our businesses,

118
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:31,241
how we motivate people,
how we apply our human resources--

119
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,520
it's built entirely
around these extrinsic motivators,

120
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,115
around carrots and sticks.

121
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,328
That's actually fine for many kinds
of 20th century tasks.

122
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:43,463
But for 21st century tasks,

123
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:47,018
that mechanistic,
reward-and-punishment approach

124
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,710
doesn't work,

125
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:50,216
often doesn't work,

126
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,411
and often does harm.

127
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,618
Let me show you.

128
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:55,719
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

129
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:58,356
he presented the problem
in a slightly different way,

130
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,400
like this up here.

131
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:03,599
Attach the candle to the wall
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.

132
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:06,099
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.

133
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:08,565
You: we're incentivizing.

134
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,040
What happened this time?

135
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,224
This time, the incentivized group
kicked the other group's butt.

136
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:18,263
Why?

137
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,581
Because when the tacks are out of the box,

138
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,237
it's pretty easy isn't it?

139
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,531
(Laughter)

140
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:32,533
If-then rewards work really well
for those sorts of tasks,

141
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,273
where there is a simple set of rules

142
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,796
and a clear destination to go to.

143
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,796
Rewards, by their very nature,

144
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,796
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;

145
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,155
that's why they work in so many cases.

146
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,258
So, for tasks like this,

147
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,635
a narrow focus, where you just see
the goal right there,

148
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,039
zoom straight ahead to it,

149
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,692
they work really well.

150
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:54,436
But for the real candle problem,

151
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,452
you don't want to be looking like this.

152
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,606
The solution is on the periphery.
You want to be looking around.

153
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,257
That reward actually narrows our focus

154
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:03,796
and restricts our possibility.

155
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,790
Let me tell you why this is so important.

156
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:10,099
In western Europe,

157
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:11,208
in many parts of Asia,

158
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:14,007
in North America, in Australia,

159
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,597
white-collar workers are doing
less of this kind of work,

160
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,001
and more of this kind of work.

161
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,656
That routine, rule-based,
left-brain work --

162
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,396
certain kinds of accounting,
financial analysis,

163
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,115
computer programming--

164
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,334
has become fairly easy to outsource,

165
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,389
fairly easy to automate.

166
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:35,589
Software can do it faster.

167
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,938
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

168
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,930
So what really matters

169
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:45,582
are the more right-brained
creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

170
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:47,987
Think about your own work.

171
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,756
Think about your own work.

172
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,275
Are the problems that you face,

173
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,796
or even the problems
we've been talking about here,

174
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,708
do they have a clear set of rules,

175
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:59,319
and a single solution?

176
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:01,796
No. The rules are mystifying.

177
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,066
The solution, if it exists at all,

178
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,796
is surprising and not obvious.

179
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,574
Everybody in this room

180
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,796
is dealing with their own version
of the candle problem.

181
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,957
And for candle problems of any kind,

182
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,651
in any field,

183
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:21,668
those if-then rewards,

184
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:25,934
the things around which we've built
so many of our businesses,

185
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,791
don't work!

186
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,271
It makes me crazy.

187
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:32,231
And here's the thing.

188
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,311
This is not a feeling.

189
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,610
Okay? I'm a lawyer;
I don't believe in feelings.

190
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:42,277
This is not a philosophy.

191
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,563
I'm an American;
I don't believe in philosophy.

192
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,274
(Laughter)

193
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,153
This is a fact --

194
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,621
or, as we say in my hometown
of Washington, D.C.,

195
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,235
a true fact.

196
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:56,703
(Laughter)

197
00:08:56,727 --> 00:09:00,521
(Applause)

198
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:02,187
Let me give you an example.

199
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:03,796
Let me marshal the evidence here.

200
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,933
I'm not telling a story,
I'm making a case.

201
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,228
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, some evidence:

202
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:11,627
Dan Ariely, one of the great
economists of our time,

203
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,122
he and three colleagues
did a study of some MIT students.

204
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,796
They gave these MIT
students a bunch of games,

205
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,796
games that involved creativity,

206
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,098
and motor skills, and concentration.

207
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,203
And the offered them, for performance,

208
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:26,241
three levels of rewards:

209
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,511
small reward, medium reward,
large reward.

210
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:34,672
If you do really well
you get the large reward, on down.

211
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,030
What happened?

212
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,796
As long as the task
involved only mechanical skill

213
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,796
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

214
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,517
the higher the pay,
the better the performance.

215
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,692
Okay?

216
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:50,796
But once the task called
for even rudimentary cognitive skill,

217
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,892
a larger reward led to poorer performance.

218
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,066
Then they said,

219
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,225
"Let's see if there's any
cultural bias here.

220
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,202
Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."

221
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,796
Standard of living is lower.

222
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,297
In Madurai, a reward that is modest
in North American standards,

223
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,662
is more meaningful there.

224
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,921
Same deal. A bunch of games,
three levels of rewards.

225
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,034
What happens?

226
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,961
People offered the medium level of rewards

227
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,565
did no better than people
offered the small rewards.

228
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,068
But this time,
people offered the highest rewards,

229
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,588
they did the worst of all.

230
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:32,010
In eight of the nine tasks we examined
across three experiments,

231
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:35,503
higher incentives led
to worse performance.

232
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:43,270
Is this some kind of touchy-feely
socialist conspiracy going on here?

233
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:46,070
No, these are economists from MIT,

234
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,796
from Carnegie Mellon,
from the University of Chicago.

235
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,441
Do you know who sponsored this research?

236
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:55,585
The Federal Reserve Bank
of the United States.

237
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,429
That's the American experience.

238
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:00,228
Let's go across the pond
to the London School of Economics,

239
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,796
LSE, London School of Economics,

240
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,264
alma mater of eleven
Nobel Laureates in economics.

241
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,796
Training ground for great
economic thinkers

242
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,796
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

243
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,107
and Mick Jagger.

244
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,430
(Laughter)

245
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,224
Last month,

246
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,747
just last month,

247
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:20,796
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,796
of pay-for-performance plans,
inside of companies.

249
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,271
Here's what they said:

250
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,091
"We find that financial incentives

251
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:31,168
can result in a negative impact
on overall performance."

252
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:36,295
There is a mismatch
between what science knows

253
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,796
and what business does.

254
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,097
And what worries me,
as we stand here in the rubble

255
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,796
of the economic collapse,

256
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,796
is that too many organizations
are making their decisions,

257
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,192
their policies about talent and people,

258
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:53,343
based on assumptions that are outdated,

259
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,557
unexamined,

260
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,343
and rooted more in folklore
than in science.

261
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:00,796
And if we really want to get
out of this economic mess,

262
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,913
if we really want high performance

263
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:05,384
on those definitional tasks
of the 21st century,

264
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:11,348
the solution is not to do
more of the wrong things,

265
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,695
to entice people with a sweeter carrot,

266
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,118
or threaten them with a sharper stick.

267
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,796
We need a whole new approach.

268
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,796
The good news is that the scientists

269
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,008
who've been studying motivation
have given us this new approach.

270
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,127
It's built much more
around intrinsic motivation.

271
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,606
Around the desire to do things
because they matter,

272
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,193
because we like it, they're interesting,
or part of something important.

273
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,796
And to my mind, that new operating
system for our businesses

274
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,521
revolves around three elements:

275
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:40,796
autonomy, mastery and purpose.

276
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,796
Autonomy: the urge
to direct our own lives.

277
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,065
Mastery: the desire to get better
and better at something that matters.

278
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,796
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

279
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,013
in the service of something
larger than ourselves.

280
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:57,331
These are the building blocks
of an entirely new operating system

281
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,796
for our businesses.

282
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,381
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

283
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,796
In the 20th century, we came up
with this idea of management.

284
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,114
Management did not emanate from nature.

285
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:11,796
Management is not a tree,
it's a television set.

286
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,044
Somebody invented it.

287
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:16,068
It doesn't mean
it's going to work forever.

288
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:18,099
Management is great.

289
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,177
Traditional notions
of management are great

290
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,796
if you want compliance.

291
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,003
But if you want engagement,
self-direction works better.

292
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:29,067
Some examples of some kind
of radical notions of self-direction.

293
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:32,027
You don't see a lot of it,

294
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:35,527
but you see the first stirrings
of something really interesting going on,

295
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:39,194
what it means is paying people adequately
and fairly, absolutely --

296
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,503
getting the issue of money off the table,

297
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,502
and then giving people lots of autonomy.

298
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:44,796
Some examples.

299
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,765
How many of you have heard
of the company Atlassian?

300
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,796
It looks like less than half.

301
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,225
(Laughter)

302
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,796
Atlassian is an Australian
software company.

303
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,791
And they do something incredibly cool.

304
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,559
A few times a year
they tell their engineers,

305
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,589
"Go for the next 24 hours
and work on anything you want,

306
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,723
as long as it's not part
of your regular job.

307
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,137
Work on anything you want."

308
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,924
Engineers use this time to come up
with a cool patch for code,

309
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,390
come up with an elegant hack.

310
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:17,380
Then they present all of the stuff
that they've developed

311
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,124
to their teammates,
to the rest of the company,

312
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:24,100
in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting
at the end of the day.

313
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,319
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.

314
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,363
They call them FedEx Days.

315
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:30,301
Why?

316
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,723
Because you have to deliver
something overnight.

317
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,204
It's pretty; not bad.

318
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,896
It's a huge trademark violation,
but it's pretty clever.

319
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,257
(Laughter)

320
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:41,959
That one day of intense autonomy

321
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,035
has produced a whole array
of software fixes

322
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,796
that might never have existed.

323
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,888
It's worked so well that Atlassian
has taken it to the next level

324
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:49,970
with 20% time --

325
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,162
done, famously, at Google --

326
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,248
where engineers can spend
20% of their time

327
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,217
working on anything they want.

328
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,908
They have autonomy over their time,

329
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,145
their task, their team, their technique.

330
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,123
Radical amounts of autonomy.

331
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:06,073
And at Google, as many of you know,

332
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,430
about half of the new products
in a typical year

333
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,930
are birthed during that 20% time:

334
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,796
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

335
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,740
Let me give you an even more
radical example of it:

336
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:20,637
something called the Results Only
Work Environment (the ROWE),

337
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:22,727
created by two American consultants,

338
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,430
in place at a dozen companies
around North America.

339
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:28,059
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.

340
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,035
They show up when they want.

341
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,113
They don't have to be in the office
at a certain time, or any time.

342
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,082
They just have to get their work done.

343
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:41,265
How they do it, when they do it,
where they do it, is totally up to them.

344
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:45,635
Meetings in these kinds
of environments are optional.

345
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,160
What happens?

346
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:49,895
Almost across the board,

347
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,129
productivity goes up,
worker engagement goes up,

348
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,796
worker satisfaction goes up,
turnover goes down.

349
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,796
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

350
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,432
the building blocks
of a new way of doing things.

351
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,796
Some of you might look at this and say,

352
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,280
"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."

353
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,658
And I say, "Nope.

354
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,753
I have proof."

355
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:15,796
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started
an encyclopedia called Encarta.

356
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,137
They had deployed
all the right incentives,

357
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:23,010
They paid professionals
to write and edit thousands of articles.

358
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,623
Well-compensated managers
oversaw the whole thing

359
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,905
to make sure it came in
on budget and on time.

360
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,324
A few years later,
another encyclopedia got started.

361
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,745
Different model, right?

362
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,826
Do it for fun.

363
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,417
No one gets paid a cent,
or a euro or a yen.

364
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,840
Do it because you like to do it.

365
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:44,796
Just 10 years ago,

366
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,069
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,

367
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,668
"Hey, I've got these two different
models for creating an encyclopedia.

368
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,613
If they went head to head, who would win?"

369
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,203
10 years ago you could not
have found a single sober economist

370
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,447
anywhere on planet Earth

371
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,343
who would have predicted
the Wikipedia model.

372
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:05,066
This is the titanic battle
between these two approaches.

373
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,158
This is the Ali-Frazier
of motivation, right?

374
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,021
This is the Thrilla in Manila.

375
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,214
Intrinsic motivators
versus extrinsic motivators.

376
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:14,796
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

377
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,377
versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?

378
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,931
Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery
and purpose, in a knockout.

379
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:21,955
Let me wrap up.

380
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,646
There is a mismatch between
what science knows and what business does.

381
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,257
Here is what science knows.

382
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,964
One: Those 20th century rewards,

383
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,968
those motivators we think
are a natural part of business,

384
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,693
do work, but only in a surprisingly
narrow band of circumstances.

385
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:42,510
Two: Those if-then rewards
often destroy creativity.

386
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:46,334
Three: The secret to high performance
isn't rewards and punishments,

387
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,968
but that unseen intrinsic drive--

388
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:50,796
the drive to do things for their own sake.

389
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,796
The drive to do things cause they matter.

390
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,796
And here's the best part.

391
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,040
We already know this.

392
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,614
The science confirms
what we know in our hearts.

393
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:03,468
So, if we repair this mismatch
between science and business,

394
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:06,425
if we bring our motivation,
notions of motivation

395
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,176
into the 21st century,

396
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,214
if we get past this lazy,
dangerous, ideology

397
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,270
of carrots and sticks,

398
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,023
we can strengthen our businesses,

399
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:19,629
we can solve a lot
of those candle problems,

400
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,385
and maybe, maybe --

401
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,573
we can change the world.

402
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:26,902
I rest my case.

403
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,926
(Applause)
