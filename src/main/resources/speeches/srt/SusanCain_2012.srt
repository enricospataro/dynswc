1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,796
When I was nine years old,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,963
I went off to summer camp
for the first time.

3
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:19,796
And my mother packed me a suitcase
full of books,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,487
which to me seemed like
a perfectly natural thing to do.

5
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:26,796
Because in my family,
reading was the primary group activity.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,796
And this might sound antisocial to you,

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,796
but for us it was really just
a different way of being social.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,796
You have the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you,

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,678
but you are also free to go
roaming around the adventureland

10
00:00:38,702 --> 00:00:39,796
inside your own mind.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,796
And I had this idea

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,344
that camp was going to be
just like this, but better.

13
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:46,796
(Laughter)

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,796
I had a vision of 10 girls
sitting in a cabin

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,201
cozily reading books
in their matching nightgowns.

16
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,796
(Laughter)

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,796
Camp was more like a keg party
without any alcohol.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,796
And on the very first day,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,796
our counselor gathered us all together

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,496
and she taught us a cheer
that she said we would be doing

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,796
every day for the rest of the summer
to instill camp spirit.

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,796
And it went like this:

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,796
"R-O-W-D-I-E,

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,796
that's the way we spell rowdie.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,213
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."

26
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,237
(Laughter)

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,796
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,868
So I couldn't figure out
for the life of me

29
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:24,796
why we were supposed to be so rowdy,

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,796
or why we had to spell
this word incorrectly.

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,796
(Laughter)

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,011
But I recited a cheer. I recited
a cheer along with everybody else.

33
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,796
I did my best.

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,899
And I just waited for the time
that I could go off and read my books.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,180
But the first time that I took
my book out of my suitcase,

36
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:49,220
the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me

37
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:51,696
and she asked me, "Why
are you being so mellow?" --

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,768
mellow, of course,
being the exact opposite

39
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:54,996
of R-O-W-D-I-E.

40
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,596
And then the second time I tried it,

41
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,796
the counselor came up to me
with a concerned expression on her face

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,916
and she repeated the point
about camp spirit

43
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,150
and said we should all work very hard
to be outgoing.

44
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,796
And so I put my books away,

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,796
back in their suitcase,

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,796
and I put them under my bed,

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,196
and there they stayed
for the rest of the summer.

48
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,996
And I felt kind of guilty about this.

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,996
I felt as if the books needed me somehow,

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,796
and they were calling out to me
and I was forsaking them.

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,696
But I did forsake them
and I didn't open that suitcase again

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,796
until I was back home with my family
at the end of the summer.

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,796
Now, I tell you this story
about summer camp.

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,796
I could have told you
50 others just like it --

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,796
all the times that I got the message

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,796
that somehow my quiet
and introverted style of being

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,796
was not necessarily the right way to go,

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,796
that I should be trying to pass
as more of an extrovert.

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,796
And I always sensed deep down
that this was wrong

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,678
and that introverts were
pretty excellent just as they were.

61
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:55,796
But for years I denied this intuition,

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,796
and so I became a Wall Street
lawyer, of all things,

63
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,796
instead of the writer
that I had always longed to be --

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,796
partly because I needed to prove to myself
that I could be bold and assertive too.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,897
And I was always going off to crowded bars

66
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,493
when I really would have preferred
to just have a nice dinner with friends.

67
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:15,796
And I made these
self-negating choices so reflexively,

68
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,523
that I wasn't even aware
that I was making them.

69
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:21,096
Now this is what many introverts do,

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,796
and it's our loss for sure,

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,796
but it is also our colleagues' loss

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,796
and our communities' loss.

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,796
And at the risk of sounding grandiose,
it is the world's loss.

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,796
Because when it comes
to creativity and to leadership,

75
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,796
we need introverts doing
what they do best.

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,344
A third to a half of the population
are introverts --

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,796
a third to a half.

78
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,796
So that's one out of every two
or three people you know.

79
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,796
So even if you're an extrovert yourself,

80
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,796
I'm talking about your coworkers

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,796
and your spouses and your children

82
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,796
and the person sitting
next to you right now --

83
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,796
all of them subject to this bias

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,916
that is pretty deep
and real in our society.

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,796
We all internalize it
from a very early age

86
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,796
without even having a language
for what we're doing.

87
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,796
Now, to see the bias clearly,

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,796
you need to understand
what introversion is.

89
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,796
It's different from being shy.

90
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,796
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,796
Introversion is more about,

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,796
how do you respond to stimulation,

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,796
including social stimulation.

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,796
So extroverts really crave
large amounts of stimulation,

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,897
whereas introverts feel
at their most alive

96
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,297
and their most switched-on
and their most capable

97
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,726
when they're in quieter,
more low-key environments.

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,179
Not all the time --
these things aren't absolute --

99
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,396
but a lot of the time.

100
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,796
So the key then to maximizing our talents

101
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,796
is for us all to put ourselves

102
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,796
in the zone of stimulation
that is right for us.

103
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,796
But now here's where the bias comes in.

104
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,796
Our most important institutions,

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,796
our schools and our workplaces,

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,796
they are designed mostly for extroverts

107
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,796
and for extroverts' need
for lots of stimulation.

108
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,796
And also we have
this belief system right now

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,796
that I call the new groupthink,

110
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,796
which holds that all creativity
and all productivity

111
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,820
comes from a very oddly gregarious place.

112
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,154
So if you picture the typical
classroom nowadays:

113
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,796
When I was going to school,
we sat in rows.

114
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,796
We sat in rows of desks like this,

115
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,083
and we did most of our work
pretty autonomously.

116
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,796
But nowadays, your typical classroom
has pods of desks --

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,796
four or five or six or seven kids
all facing each other.

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,297
And kids are working
in countless group assignments.

119
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,796
Even in subjects like math
and creative writing,

120
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,796
which you think would depend
on solo flights of thought,

121
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,796
kids are now expected to act
as committee members.

122
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,011
And for the kids who prefer to go off
by themselves or just to work alone,

123
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,896
those kids are seen as outliers often

124
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,820
or, worse, as problem cases.

125
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,442
And the vast majority of teachers

126
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,196
reports believing that
the ideal student is an extrovert

127
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,796
as opposed to an introvert,

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,154
even though introverts
actually get better grades

129
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:55,796
and are more knowledgeable,

130
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,796
according to research.

131
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,796
(Laughter)

132
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,796
Okay, same thing is true
in our workplaces.

133
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,796
Now, most of us work in open plan offices,

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,796
without walls,

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,106
where we are subject to the constant
noise and gaze of our coworkers.

136
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,796
And when it comes to leadership,

137
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,796
introverts are routinely passed over
for leadership positions,

138
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,036
even though introverts
tend to be very careful,

139
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,036
much less likely to take outsize risks --

140
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,796
which is something
we might all favor nowadays.

141
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,796
And interesting research
by Adam Grant at the Wharton School

142
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,796
has found that introverted leaders

143
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,154
often deliver better outcomes
than extroverts do,

144
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,796
because when they are managing
proactive employees,

145
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,083
they're much more likely to let
those employees run with their ideas,

146
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:39,203
whereas an extrovert
can, quite unwittingly,

147
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:40,796
get so excited about things

148
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,036
that they're putting
their own stamp on things,

149
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,796
and other people's ideas might not
as easily then bubble up to the surface.

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,596
Now in fact, some of our transformative
leaders in history have been introverts.

151
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,996
I'll give you some examples.

152
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,796
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --

153
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,796
all these peopled described themselves
as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.

154
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,796
And they all took the spotlight,

155
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,820
even though every bone in their bodies
was telling them not to.

156
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,696
And this turns out to have
a special power all its own,

157
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,696
because people could feel
that these leaders were at the helm

158
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,696
not because they enjoyed directing others

159
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,996
and not out of the pleasure
of being looked at;

160
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,068
they were there
because they had no choice,

161
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:23,264
because they were driven to do
what they thought was right.

162
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,896
Now I think at this point
it's important for me to say

163
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,796
that I actually love extroverts.

164
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,796
I always like to say some of my best
friends are extroverts,

165
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
including my beloved husband.

166
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,059
And we all fall
at different points, of course,

167
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,796
along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,226
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist
who first popularized these terms,

169
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,641
said that there's no such thing
as a pure introvert

170
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:47,996
or a pure extrovert.

171
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,544
He said that such a man
would be in a lunatic asylum,

172
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,796
if he existed at all.

173
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,796
And some people fall smack in the middle
of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,

174
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,796
and we call these people ambiverts.

175
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
And I often think that they have
the best of all worlds.

176
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,796
But many of us do recognize
ourselves as one type or the other.

177
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,106
And what I'm saying is that culturally,
we need a much better balance.

178
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,796
We need more of a yin and yang
between these two types.

179
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,796
This is especially important

180
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,106
when it comes to creativity
and to productivity,

181
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,796
because when psychologists look
at the lives of the most creative people,

182
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,796
what they find

183
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,106
are people who are very good
at exchanging ideas

184
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,796
and advancing ideas,

185
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,796
but who also have a serious
streak of introversion in them.

186
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,049
And this is because solitude

187
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,196
is a crucial ingredient
often to creativity.

188
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,796
So Darwin,

189
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,796
he took long walks alone in the woods

190
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,796
and emphatically turned down
dinner-party invitations.

191
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,796
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,845
he dreamed up many
of his amazing creations

193
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,845
in a lonely bell tower office that he had

194
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,796
in the back of his house
in La Jolla, California.

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,796
And he was actually afraid to meet
the young children who read his books

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,820
for fear that they were expecting him
this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure

197
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:02,796
and would be disappointed
with his more reserved persona.

198
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,059
Steve Wozniak invented
the first Apple computer

199
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,080
sitting alone in his cubicle
in Hewlett-Packard

200
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,741
where he was working at the time.

201
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,440
And he says that he never would have
become such an expert in the first place

202
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:15,896
had he not been too introverted
to leave the house

203
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,196
when he was growing up.

204
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:19,796
Now, of course,

205
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,796
this does not mean that we should
all stop collaborating --

206
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,440
and case in point, is Steve Wozniak
famously coming together with Steve Jobs

207
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,796
to start Apple Computer --

208
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,796
but it does mean that solitude matters

209
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,796
and that for some people
it is the air that they breathe.

210
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,796
And in fact, we have known for centuries
about the transcendent power of solitude.

211
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,796
It's only recently that
we've strangely begun to forget it.

212
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,796
If you look at most
of the world's major religions,

213
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,796
you will find seekers --

214
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,796
Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --

215
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,796
seekers who are going off by themselves
alone to the wilderness,

216
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,496
where they then have profound
epiphanies and revelations

217
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,196
that they then bring back
to the rest of the community.

218
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,796
So, no wilderness, no revelations.

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,796
This is no surprise, though,

220
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,796
if you look at the insights
of contemporary psychology.

221
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,796
It turns out that we can't
even be in a group of people

222
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,796
without instinctively mirroring,
mimicking their opinions.

223
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,154
Even about seemingly
personal and visceral things

224
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,796
like who you're attracted to,

225
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,796
you will start aping the beliefs
of the people around you

226
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,344
without even realizing
that that's what you're doing.

227
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,796
And groups famously follow the opinions

228
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,496
of the most dominant
or charismatic person in the room,

229
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,296
even though there's zero correlation

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,096
between being the best talker
and having the best ideas --

231
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,796
I mean zero.

232
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,796
So --

233
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,796
(Laughter)

234
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,796
You might be following the person
with the best ideas,

235
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,796
but you might not.

236
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,796
And do you really want
to leave it up to chance?

237
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,201
Much better for everybody
to go off by themselves,

238
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,796
generate their own ideas

239
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,963
freed from the distortions
of group dynamics,

240
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,796
and then come together as a team

241
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,796
to talk them through
in a well-managed environment

242
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,796
and take it from there.

243
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,796
Now if all this is true,

244
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,796
then why are we getting it so wrong?

245
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,796
Why are we setting up our schools
this way, and our workplaces?

246
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,344
And why are we making
these introverts feel so guilty

247
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,296
about wanting to just go off
by themselves some of the time?

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,796
One answer lies deep
in our cultural history.

249
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,796
Western societies,

250
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,796
and in particular the U.S.,

251
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,925
have always favored the man of action
over the "man" of contemplation.

252
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,796
But in America's early days,

253
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,796
we lived in what historians
call a culture of character,

254
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,916
where we still,
at that point, valued people

255
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,796
for their inner selves
and their moral rectitude.

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,396
And if you look at the self-help
books from this era,

257
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,196
they all had titles with things like

258
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,796
"Character, the Grandest
Thing in the World."

259
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,796
And they featured role models
like Abraham Lincoln,

260
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,106
who was praised for being
modest and unassuming.

261
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,796
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him

262
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,796
"A man who does not
offend by superiority."

263
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,796
But then we hit the 20th century,

264
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,796
and we entered a new culture

265
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,083
that historians call
the culture of personality.

266
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:08,783
What happened is we had evolved
an agricultural economy

267
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,196
to a world of big business.

268
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,796
And so suddenly people are moving
from small towns to the cities.

269
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,131
And instead of working alongside people
they've known all their lives,

270
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:20,796
now they are having to prove themselves
in a crowd of strangers.

271
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,796
So, quite understandably,

272
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,796
qualities like magnetism and charisma
suddenly come to seem really important.

273
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,011
And sure enough, the self-help books
change to meet these new needs

274
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,796
and they start to have names

275
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,036
like "How to Win Friends
and Influence People."

276
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,796
And they feature as their role models
really great salesmen.

277
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
So that's the world we're living in today.

278
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,796
That's our cultural inheritance.

279
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,796
Now none of this is to say
that social skills are unimportant,

280
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,796
and I'm also not calling
for the abolishing of teamwork at all.

281
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,011
The same religions who send their sages
off to lonely mountain tops

282
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,796
also teach us love and trust.

283
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,796
And the problems that we are facing today

284
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,796
in fields like science and in economics

285
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,796
are so vast and so complex

286
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,596
that we are going to need armies
of people coming together

287
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,196
to solve them working together.

288
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,996
But I am saying that the more freedom
that we give introverts to be themselves,

289
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,496
the more likely that they are

290
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
to come up with their own unique
solutions to these problems.

291
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,820
So now I'd like to share with you
what's in my suitcase today.

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,796
Guess what?

293
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,796
Books.

294
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,796
I have a suitcase full of books.

295
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,796
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."

296
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,796
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.

297
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,796
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed"
by Maimonides.

298
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,796
But these are not exactly my books.

299
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,796
I brought these books with me

300
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,796
because they were written
by my grandfather's favorite authors.

301
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,796
My grandfather was a rabbi

302
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,796
and he was a widower

303
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,796
who lived alone in a small
apartment in Brooklyn

304
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,796
that was my favorite place
in the world when I was growing up,

305
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,249
partly because it was filled with
his very gentle, very courtly presence

306
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,796
and partly because
it was filled with books.

307
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,796
I mean literally every table,
every chair in this apartment

308
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,796
had yielded its original function

309
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,796
to now serve as a surface
for swaying stacks of books.

310
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,796
Just like the rest of my family,

311
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,106
my grandfather's favorite thing to do
in the whole world was to read.

312
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,796
But he also loved his congregation,

313
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,796
and you could feel this love
in the sermons that he gave

314
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,796
every week for the 62 years
that he was a rabbi.

315
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,796
He would takes the fruits
of each week's reading

316
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,132
and he would weave

317
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,997
these intricate tapestries
of ancient and humanist thought.

318
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:43,659
And people would come from all over
to hear him speak.

319
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:46,796
But here's the thing about my grandfather.

320
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,496
Underneath this ceremonial role,

321
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,796
he was really modest
and really introverted --

322
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,796
so much so that when
he delivered these sermons,

323
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,796
he had trouble making eye contact

324
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,820
with the very same congregation
that he had been speaking to for 62 years.

325
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,796
And even away from the podium,

326
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,796
when you called him to say hello,

327
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,059
he would often end
the conversation prematurely

328
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,796
for fear that he was taking up
too much of your time.

329
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,796
But when he died at the age of 94,

330
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,796
the police had to close down
the streets of his neighborhood

331
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,730
to accommodate the crowd of people
who came out to mourn him.

332
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,696
And so these days I try to learn
from my grandfather's example

333
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,096
in my own way.

334
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,796
So I just published a book
about introversion,

335
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
and it took me about seven years to write.

336
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,796
And for me, that seven years
was like total bliss,

337
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,796
because I was reading, I was writing,

338
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,796
I was thinking, I was researching.

339
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,796
It was my version

340
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,796
of my grandfather's hours
of the day alone in his library.

341
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,796
But now all of a sudden
my job is very different,

342
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,796
and my job is to be
out here talking about it,

343
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,796
talking about introversion.

344
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,796
(Laughter)

345
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,796
And that's a lot harder for me,

346
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,796
because as honored as I am
to be here with all of you right now,

347
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,796
this is not my natural milieu.

348
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,796
So I prepared for moments
like these as best I could.

349
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,106
I spent the last year
practicing public speaking

350
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,796
every chance I could get.

351
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,796
And I call this my "year
of speaking dangerously."

352
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,796
(Laughter)

353
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,796
And that actually helped a lot.

354
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,796
But I'll tell you, what helps even more

355
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,796
is my sense, my belief, my hope
that when it comes to our attitudes

356
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,940
to introversion and to quiet
and to solitude,

357
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:34,441
we truly are poised on the brink
on dramatic change.

358
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:35,796
I mean, we are.

359
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,796
And so I am going to leave you now

360
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,796
with three calls for action
for those who share this vision.

361
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,796
Number one:

362
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,796
Stop the madness for constant group work.

363
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,796
Just stop it.

364
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,796
(Laughter)

365
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,796
Thank you.

366
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,796
(Applause)

367
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,963
And I want to be clear
about what I'm saying,

368
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,796
because I deeply believe our offices

369
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,796
should be encouraging casual, chatty
cafe-style types of interactions --

370
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,940
you know, the kind
where people come together

371
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,155
and serendipitously have
an exchange of ideas.

372
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,796
That is great.

373
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,496
It's great for introverts
and it's great for extroverts.

374
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,949
But we need much more privacy
and much more freedom

375
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:15,496
and much more autonomy at work.

376
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,796
School, same thing.

377
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,796
We need to be teaching kids
to work together, for sure,

378
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,796
but we also need to be teaching them
how to work on their own.

379
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,596
This is especially important
for extroverted children too.

380
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,096
They need to work on their own

381
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,692
because that is where deep thought
comes from in part.

382
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,796
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.

383
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,796
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.

384
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,796
I'm not saying

385
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,059
that we all have to now go off and build
our own cabins in the woods

386
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,796
and never talk to each other again,

387
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,154
but I am saying that we could
all stand to unplug

388
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:49,820
and get inside our own heads
a little more often.

389
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,796
Number three:

390
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,249
Take a good look
at what's inside your own suitcase

391
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,796
and why you put it there.

392
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,796
So extroverts,

393
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,893
maybe your suitcases
are also full of books.

394
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:06,796
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses
or skydiving equipment.

395
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,796
Whatever it is, I hope you take
these things out every chance you get

396
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,796
and grace us with your energy
and your joy.

397
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,796
But introverts, you being you,

398
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,374
you probably have the impulse
to guard very carefully

399
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,274
what's inside your own suitcase.

400
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,796
And that's okay.

401
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,796
But occasionally, just occasionally,

402
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
I hope you will open up your suitcases
for other people to see,

403
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:30,844
because the world needs you and it
needs the things you carry.

404
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,059
So I wish you the best
of all possible journeys

405
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,796
and the courage to speak softly.

406
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,796
Thank you very much.

407
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,796
(Applause)

408
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,796
Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,820
(Applause)
