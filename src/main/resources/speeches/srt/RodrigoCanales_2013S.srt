1
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:17,113
In December of 2010,

2
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:18,930
the city of Apatzingán

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,082
in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,

4
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:24,452
awoke to gunfire.

5
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:26,028
For two straight days,

6
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,446
the city became an open battlefield

7
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,230
between the federal forces

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,899
and a well-organized group,

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,682
presumably from the local criminal organization,

10
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:38,054
La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.

11
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:41,204
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire

12
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,624
but also explosions

13
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,895
and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,

14
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,912
so truly like a battlefield.

15
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,442
After these two days,

16
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,247
and during a particularly intense encounter,

17
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,814
it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,

18
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:58,319
Nazario Moreno, was killed.

19
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,330
In response to this terrifying violence,

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,329
the mayor of Apatzingán

21
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,629
decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,976
The idea was to ask for a softer approach

23
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:10,394
to criminal activity in the state.

24
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,588
And so, the day of the scheduled procession,

25
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,442
thousands of people showed up.

26
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,136
As the mayor was preparing to deliver

27
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,247
the speech starting the march,

28
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,749
his team noticed

29
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,907
that, while half of the participants

30
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,582
were appropriately dressed in white,

31
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:28,422
and bearing banners asking for peace,

32
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,591
the other half was actually marching

33
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,682
in support of the criminal organization

34
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,866
and its now-presumed-defunct leader.

35
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,935
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside

36
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,946
rather than participate or lead a procession

37
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:45,331
that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.

38
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,573
And so his team stepped aside.

39
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,649
The two marches joined together,

40
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,654
and they continued their path

41
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,264
towards the state capital.

42
00:01:55,264 --> 00:02:00,075
This story of horrific violence

43
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:02,272
followed by a fumbled approach

44
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,467
by federal and local authorities as they tried

45
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,890
to engage civil society,

46
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,246
who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,

47
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:12,710
is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,

48
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,059
where we see that our current understanding

49
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,427
of drug violence and what leads to it

50
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:21,029
is probably at the very least incomplete.

51
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,032
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying

52
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,062
to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico

53
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,701
by, say, just researching online,

54
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,542
the first thing you would find out is that

55
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:33,509
while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,

56
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:34,628
there are some that are more

57
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:37,987
and there are some that are much less equal than others,

58
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,238
because you will quickly find out

59
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:40,942
that in the past six years

60
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:43,090
anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,648
have lost their lives in drug-related violence.

62
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:48,395
To put these numbers in perspective,

63
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,211
this is eight times larger than the number of casualties

64
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:55,732
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.

65
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:58,236
It's also shockingly close to the number of people

66
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:00,762
who have died in the Syrian civil war,

67
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,975
which is an active civil war.

68
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,171
This is happening just south of the border.

69
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,775
Now as you're reading, however,

70
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,458
you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly

71
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,494
become numb to the numbers of deaths,

72
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:15,180
because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,773
of faceless, nameless dead people.

74
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:21,497
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative

75
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,332
that all the people who are dying

76
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:26,188
were somehow involved in the drug trade,

77
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:29,784
and we infer this because they were either tortured

78
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,945
or executed in a professional manner,

79
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,597
or, most likely, both.

80
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,578
And so clearly they were criminals

81
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:38,193
because of the way they died.

82
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,756
And so the narrative is that somehow these people

83
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:41,999
got what they were deserved.

84
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,450
They were part of the bad guys.

85
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,998
And that creates some form of comfort

86
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,630
for a lot of people.

87
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,594
However, while it's easier to think

88
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:55,579
of us, the citizens, the police, the army,

89
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,151
as the good guys, and them, the narcos,

90
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:02,445
the carteles, as the bad guys,

91
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:03,611
if you think about it,

92
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,419
the latter are only providing a service to the former.

93
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,534
Whether we like it or not,

94
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:12,195
the U.S. is the largest market

95
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:13,813
for illegal substances in the world,

96
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,867
accounting for more than half of global demand.

97
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:20,127
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico

98
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,245
that is its only route of access from the South,

99
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,300
and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,029
used to say, "Poor Mexico,

101
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:35,221
so far from God and so close to the United States."

102
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,070
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users

103
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,537
of illegal drugs in the United States.

104
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:42,963
Using very, very conservative assumptions,

105
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:46,060
this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side

106
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,843
of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.

107
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:51,512
If we assume that the narcos only have access

108
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:54,236
to the wholesale part, which we know is false,

109
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,577
that still leaves you with yearly revenues

110
00:04:56,577 --> 00:05:01,095
of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.

111
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:03,011
To put these numbers in perspective,

112
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,804
Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.

113
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,310
And it so happens that this is a product that,

114
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,285
because of its nature, a business model

115
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:16,039
to address this market requires you

116
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,168
to guarantee to your producers

117
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,786
that their product will be reliably placed

118
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,903
in the markets where it is consumed.

119
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:26,460
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,

120
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,470
is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors

121
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,769
that are used to transport drugs.

122
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,286
Hence the violence.

123
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:37,318
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,

124
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,438
you will see that it almost perfectly aligns

125
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,222
with the most efficient routes of transportation

126
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,117
from the south to the north.

127
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:44,273
The only thing that the cartels are doing

128
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:47,024
is that they're trying to protect their business.

129
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,449
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,

130
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,544
but it's also a complex one.

131
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:54,253
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant

132
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,584
that can only grow in certain latitudes,

133
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,320
and so it means that a business model

134
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,055
to address this market requires you to have

135
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,576
decentralized, international production,

136
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:05,120
that by the way needs to have good quality control,

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,621
because people need a good high

138
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,206
that is not going to kill them

139
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:12,068
and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.

140
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,061
And so that means they need to secure

141
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,963
production and quality control in the south,

142
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,970
and you need to ensure that you have

143
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,462
efficient and effective distribution channels

144
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,901
in the markets where these drugs are consumed.

145
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,492
I urge you, but only a little bit,

146
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:28,703
because I don't want to get you in trouble,

147
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:31,989
to just ask around and see how difficult it would be

148
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:34,846
to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,

149
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:37,791
whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,

150
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,604
and some of you may be surprised to know

151
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,618
that there are many dealers that offer a service

152
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,442
where if you send them a text message,

153
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,147
they guarantee delivery of the drug

154
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:49,029
in 30 minutes or less.

155
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,450
Think about this for a second.

156
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,181
Think about the complexity

157
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:56,581
of the distribution network that I just described.

158
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,079
It's very difficult to reconcile this

159
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,201
with the image of faceless, ignorant goons

160
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,806
that are just shooting each other,

161
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,494
very difficult to reconcile.

162
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,823
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,

163
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:13,498
an effective organization requires

164
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,407
an integrated strategy that includes

165
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:18,280
a good organizational structure, good incentives,

166
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,272
a solid identity and good brand management.

167
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,407
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn

168
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:26,307
in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.

169
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,869
Because you would quickly realize,

170
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,532
and maybe be confused by the fact,

171
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,769
that there are three organizations

172
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,304
that are constantly named in the articles.

173
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,378
You will hear about Los Zetas,

174
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:38,349
the Knights Templar, which is the new brand

175
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,207
for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,

176
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,581
and the Sinaloa Federation.

177
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:46,372
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment

178
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:50,727
of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter

179
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,853
and they silence the press,

180
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:56,227
and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.

181
00:07:56,227 --> 00:08:00,306
But this is the result of a very careful branding

182
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,107
and business strategy.

183
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,276
You see, Los Zetas is not just

184
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,076
this random assortment of individuals,

185
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:09,731
but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,

186
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:12,743
that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.

187
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,157
When that corridor became contested, they decided

188
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:16,947
that they wanted to recruit

189
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,778
a professional enforcement arm.

190
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,387
So they recruited Los Zetas:

191
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,145
an entire unit of elite paratroopers

192
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:29,162
from the Mexican Army.

193
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:32,868
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,

194
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,756
so much so that at some point, they decided

195
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:37,249
to just take over the operations,

196
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:41,043
which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,

197
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:43,684
because they grow up.

198
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:47,380
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,

199
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,316
they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution

200
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,523
in the most profitable markets like cocaine,

201
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:53,813
but what they did have,

202
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,273
and this is again based on their military origin,

203
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:59,120
was a perfectly structured chain of command

204
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,745
with a very clear hierarchy

205
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:05,809
and a very clear promotion path that allowed them

206
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:09,631
to supervise and operate across many, many markets

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,273
very effectively,

208
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:15,072
which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.

209
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,361
And so because they didn't have access

210
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,696
to the more profitable drug markets,

211
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,369
this pushed them and gave them the opportunity

212
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:23,867
to diversify into other forms of crime.

213
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,922
That includes kidnapping, prostitution,

214
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:30,103
local drug dealing and human trafficking,

215
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:34,059
including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.

216
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,307
So what they currently run is truly

217
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:41,879
and quite literally a franchise business.

218
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,710
They focus most of their recruiting on the army,

219
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,787
and they very openly advertise for better salaries,

220
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,485
better benefits, better promotion paths,

221
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,133
not to mention much better food,

222
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,840
than what the army can deliver.

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,709
The way they operate is that

224
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:59,614
when they arrive in a locality,

225
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,365
they let people know that they are there,

226
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,435
and they go to the most powerful local gang

227
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,675
and they say, "I offer you

228
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,864
to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."

229
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,737
If they agree -- and you don't want to know

230
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,480
what happens if they don't --

231
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,167
they train them and they supervise them

232
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,494
on how to run the most efficient criminal operation

233
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,995
for that town, in exchange for royalties.

234
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,901
This kind of business model obviously depends

235
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,298
entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,

236
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,671
and so Los Zetas

237
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,964
carefully stage acts of violence

238
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,897
that are spectacular in nature,

239
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:35,697
especially when they arrive first in a city,

240
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:38,931
but again, that's just a brand strategy.

241
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,830
I'm not saying they're not violent,

242
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,773
but what I am saying is that even though you will read

243
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,636
that they are the most violent of all,

244
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,599
when you count, when you do the body count,

245
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:51,371
they're actually all the same.

246
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:54,459
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar

247
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,299
that arose in Michoacán

248
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,906
emerged in reaction to the incursion

249
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:01,441
of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.

250
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:04,358
Michoacán is a geographically strategic state

251
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,361
because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,

252
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,952
and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,

253
00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:12,018
which then gives you direct access to the U.S.

254
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,557
The Knights Templar realized very quickly

255
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:17,065
that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,

256
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,422
and so they developed a strategy

257
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:22,201
as a social enterprise.

258
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,201
They brand themselves as representative of

259
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,857
and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán

260
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:30,155
against organized crime.

261
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,886
Their brand of social enterprise means

262
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,937
that they require a lot of civic engagement,

263
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:38,103
so they invest heavily in providing local services,

264
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:41,601
like dealing with home violence,

265
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,377
going after petty criminals, treating addicts,

266
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,155
and keeping drugs out of the local markets

267
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,635
where they are,

268
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,254
and, of course, protecting people

269
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,745
from other criminal organizations.

270
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,776
Now, they kill a lot of people too,

271
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,873
but when they kill them,

272
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,788
they provide very careful narratives and descriptions

273
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,040
for why they did them,

274
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,003
through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,

275
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:10,469
and billboards that explain that the people who were killed

276
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,797
were killed because they represented a threat

277
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,653
not to us, as an organization, of course,

278
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,589
but to you, as citizens.

279
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,045
And so we're actually here to protect you.

280
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,609
They, as social enterprises do,

281
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,109
have created a moral and ethical code

282
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,478
that they advertise around,

283
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,616
and they have very strict recruiting practices.

284
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,439
And here you have the types of explanations

285
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,380
that they provide for some of their actions.

286
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,276
They have actually retained access

287
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,576
to the profitable drug trade,

288
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,786
but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,

289
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,929
and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,

290
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,731
they leverage that to, for example,

291
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,288
trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created

292
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:49,688
and legally extracted

293
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,690
with illegal ephedrine from China

294
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,114
which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines

295
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:57,514
that they produce, and then they have partnerships

296
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:00,052
with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation

297
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,742
that place their products in the U.S.

298
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,413
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.

299
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,611
When you read about them, you will often read about them

300
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:11,311
with an undertone of reverence and admiration,

301
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,227
because they are the most integrated

302
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,515
and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,

303
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:18,969
and, many people argue, the world.

304
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,953
They started as just sort of a transport organization

305
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:24,027
that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.

306
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:26,152
and the Mexican borders,

307
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,570
but now they have grown

308
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,996
into a truly integrated multinational

309
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,302
that has partnerships in production in the south

310
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:36,315
and partnerships in global distribution

311
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,809
across the planet.

312
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:42,139
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,

313
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,457
business acumen and innovation.

314
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,556
They have designed new drug products

315
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,279
and new drug processes.

316
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,497
They have designed narco-tunnels

317
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,038
that go across the border,

318
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,853
and you can see that these are not

319
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:58,801
"The Shawshank Redemption" types.

320
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,497
They have invented narco-submarines and boats

321
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:05,180
that are not detected by radar.

322
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,743
They have invented drones to transport drugs,

323
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:11,029
catapults, you name it.

324
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:13,370
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation

325
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,808
actually made it to the Forbes list.

326
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,781
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]

327
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:20,686
Like any multinational would, they have specialized

328
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,975
and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,

329
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,653
which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,

330
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:27,938
heroine, methamphetamines.

331
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,511
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,

332
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,252
the way they control their operations

333
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:34,034
is through family ties.

334
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,979
When they're entering a new market, they send

335
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,700
a family member to supervise it,

336
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,517
or, if they're partnering with a new organization,

337
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:41,937
they create a family tie,

338
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:46,403
either through marriages or other types of ties.

339
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,566
Like any other multinational would,

340
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,733
they protect their brand by outsourcing

341
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,901
the more questionable parts of the business model,

342
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:55,944
like for example, when they have to engage

343
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:58,709
in violence against other criminal organizations,

344
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,154
they recruit gangs and other smaller players

345
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:03,953
to do the dirty work for them,

346
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,738
and they try to separate their operations

347
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,373
and their violence and be very discrete about this.

348
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,869
To further strengthen their brand,

349
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,762
they actually have professional P.R. firms

350
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:17,241
that shape how the press talks about them.

351
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,792
They have professional videographers on staff.

352
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,905
They have incredibly productive ties

353
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:24,738
with the security organizations

354
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:28,150
on both sides of the border.

355
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,751
And so, differences aside,

356
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,306
what these three organizations share

357
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:37,946
is on the one hand, a very clear understanding

358
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:41,030
that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,

359
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,970
but rather they are built from the bottom up

360
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,253
one interaction at a time.

361
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,674
They have created extremely coherent structures

362
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:52,508
that they use to show the inconsistencies

363
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:56,535
in government policies.

364
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:59,022
And so what I want you to remember from this talk

365
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,555
are three things.

366
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:03,611
The first one is that drug violence

367
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,488
is actually the result

368
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:08,739
of a huge market demand

369
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:12,389
and an institutional setup that forces

370
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,515
the servicing of this market to necessitate violence

371
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:19,560
to guarantee delivery routes.

372
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,486
The second thing I want you to remember

373
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,432
is that these are sophisticated,

374
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,355
coherent organizations

375
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:28,313
that are business organizations,

376
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,232
and analyzing them and treating them as such

377
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:33,621
is probably a much more useful approach.

378
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,757
The third thing I want you to remember

379
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,185
is that even though we're more comfortable

380
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:39,708
with this idea of "them,"

381
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,449
a set of bad guys separated from us,

382
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:45,426
we are actually accomplices to them,

383
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,815
either through our direct consumption

384
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:51,887
or through our acceptance of the inconsistency

385
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,155
between our policies of prohibition

386
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:57,103
and our actual behavior of tolerance

387
00:16:57,103 --> 00:17:01,327
or even encouragement of consumption.

388
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:05,347
These organizations service, recruit from,

389
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,675
and operate within our communities,

390
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,093
so necessarily, they are much more integrated

391
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:14,563
within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.

392
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:17,428
And so to me the question is not whether

393
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,709
these dynamics will continue the way they have.

394
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,474
We see that the nature of this phenomenon

395
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,942
guarantees that they will.

396
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,822
The question is whether we are willing to continue

397
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:33,428
our support of a failed strategy

398
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:38,935
based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance

399
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:43,896
at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.

400
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,627
Thank you.

401
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:50,789
(Applause)
