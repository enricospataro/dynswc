1
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:19,106
Thank you. Thank you So Much. Thank you. Thank
you so much. Madam Chairwoman, thank you so

2
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:26,098
much for your kind words and your leadership.
To Prime Minister Hailemariam, and the people

3
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:33,154
of Ethiopia -- once again, thank you for your
wonderful hospitality and for hosting this

4
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:42,843
pan-African institution. (Applause.) To members
of the African Union, distinguished guests,

5
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:51,341
ladies and gentlemen -- thank you for welcoming
me here today. It is a great honor to be the

6
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:59,140
first President of the United States to address
the African Union. (Applause.)

7
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:05,107
I’m grateful for this opportunity to speak
to the representatives of more than one billion

8
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:14,041
people of the great African continent. (Applause.)
We’re joined today by citizens, by leaders

9
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,860
of civil society, by faith communities, and
I’m especially pleased to see so many young

10
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:26,236
people who embody the energy and optimism
of today’s Africa. Hello! Thank you for

11
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,140
being here. (Applause.)

12
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:44,863
I stand before you as a proud American. I
also stand before you as the son of an African.

13
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:54,038
(Applause.) Africa and its people helped to
shape America and allowed it to become the

14
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,160
great nation that it is. And Africa and its
people have helped shape who I am and how

15
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:07,091
I see the world. In the villages in Kenya
where my father was born, I learned of my

16
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:14,390
ancestors, and the life of my grandfather,
the dreams of my father, the bonds of family

17
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,223
that connect us all as Africans and Americans.

18
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:26,120
As parents, Michelle and I want to make sure
that our two daughters know their heritage

19
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:34,691
-- European and African, in all of its strengths
and all of its struggle. So we’ve taken

20
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:42,150
our daughters and stood with them on the shores
of West Africa, in those doors of no return,

21
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:49,023
mindful that their ancestors were both slaves
and slave owners. We’ve stood with them

22
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:55,076
in that small cell on Robben Island where
Madiba showed the world that, no matter the

23
00:02:55,076 --> 00:03:06,154
nature of his physical confinement, he alone
was the master of his fate. (Applause.) For

24
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:16,753
us, for our children, Africa and its people
teach us a powerful lesson -- that we must

25
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,292
uphold the inherent dignity of every human
being.

26
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,808
Dignity -- that basic idea that by virtue
of our common humanity, no matter where we

27
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:39,230
come from, or what we look like, we are all
born equal, touched by the grace of God. (Applause.)

28
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:45,482
Every person has worth. Every person matters.
Every person deserves to be treated with decency

29
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:55,773
and respect. Throughout much of history, mankind
did not see this. Dignity was seen as a virtue

30
00:03:56,529 --> 00:04:06,534
reserved to those of rank and privilege, kings
and elders. It took a revolution of the spirit,

31
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:14,070
over many centuries, to open our eyes to the
dignity of every person. And around the world,

32
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:21,590
generations have struggled to put this idea
into practice in laws and in institutions.

33
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:31,118
So, too, here in Africa. This is the cradle
of humanity, and ancient African kingdoms

34
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:41,100
were home to great libraries and universities.
But the evil of slavery took root not only

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,079
abroad, but here on the continent. Colonialism
skewed Africa’s economy and robbed people

36
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:57,102
of their capacity to shape their own destiny.
Eventually, liberation movements grew. And

37
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:05,026
50 years ago, in a great burst of self-determination,
Africans rejoiced as foreign flags came down

38
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:14,107
and your national flags went up. (Applause.)
As South Africa’s Albert Luthuli said at

39
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:20,038
the time, “the basis for peace and brotherhood
in Africa is being restored by the resurrection

40
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:27,063
of national sovereignty and independence,
of equality and the dignity of man.”

41
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:36,064
A half-century into this independence era,
it is long past time to put aside old stereotypes

42
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:41,139
of an Africa forever mired in poverty and
conflict. The world must recognize Africa’s

43
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,096
extraordinary progress. Today, Africa is one
of the fastest-growing regions in the world.

44
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:54,159
Africa’s middle class is projected to grow
to more than one billion consumers. (Applause.)

45
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:03,124
With hundreds of millions of mobile phones,
surging access to the Internet, Africans are

46
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:13,040
beginning to leapfrog old technologies into
new prosperity. Africa is on the move, a new

47
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:16,066
Africa is emerging.

48
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:22,060
Propelled by this progress, and in partnership
with the world, Africa has achieved historic

49
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:30,015
gains in health. The rate of new HIV/AIDS
infections has plummeted. African mothers

50
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:36,096
are more likely to survive childbirth and
have healthy babies. Deaths from malaria have

51
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:43,169
been slashed, saving the lives of millions
of African children. Millions have been lifted

52
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:51,161
from extreme poverty. Africa has led the world
in sending more children to school. In other

53
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:57,083
words, more and more African men, women and
children are living with dignity and with

54
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,083
hope. (Applause.)

55
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:06,136
And Africa’s progress can also be seen in
the institutions that bring us together today.

56
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:12,122
When I first came to Sub-Saharan Africa as
a President, I said that Africa doesn’t

57
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:21,028
need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.
(Applause.) And one of those institutions

58
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:26,150
can be the African Union. Here, you can come
together, with a shared commitment to human

59
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:33,030
dignity and development. Here, your 54 nations
pursue a common vision of an “integrated,

60
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:37,100
prosperous and peaceful Africa.”

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,046
As Africa changes, I’ve called on the world
to change its approach to Africa. (Applause.)

62
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:52,120
So many Africans have told me, we don’t
want just aid, we want trade that fuels progress.

63
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:59,016
We don’t want patrons, we want partners
who help us build our own capacity to grow.

64
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:04,077
(Applause.) We don’t want the indignity
of dependence, we want to make our own choices

65
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,128
and determine our own future.

66
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:12,064
As President, I’ve worked to transform America’s
relationship with Africa -- so that we’re

67
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:17,068
truly listening to our African friends and
working together, as equal partners. And I’m

68
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:25,102
proud of the progress that we’ve made. We’ve
boosted American exports to this region, part

69
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:31,061
of trade that supports jobs for Africans and
Americans. To sustain our momentum -- and

70
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:35,138
with the bipartisan support of some of the
outstanding members of Congress who are here

71
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,307
today -- 20 of them who are here today -- I
recently signed the 10-year renewal of the

72
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,790
African Growth and Opportunity Act. (Applause.)
And I want to thank them all. Why don't they

73
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:54,136
stand very briefly so you can see them, because
they’ve done outstanding work. (Applause.)

74
00:08:55,036 --> 00:09:03,099
We’ve launched major initiatives to promote
food security, and public health and access

75
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:09,172
to electricity, and to prepare the next generation
of African leaders and entrepreneurs --investments

76
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:18,086
that will help fuel Africa’s rise for decades
to come. Last year, as the Chairwoman noted,

77
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:22,112
I welcomed nearly 50 African presidents and
prime ministers to Washington so we could

78
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:28,151
begin a new chapter of cooperation. And by
coming to the African Union today, I’m looking

79
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,352
to build on that commitment.

80
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:37,860
I believe Africa’s rise is not just important
for Africa, it's important to the entire world.

81
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:42,105
We will not be able to meet the challenges
of our time -- from ensuring a strong global

82
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,968
economy to facing down violent extremism,
to combating climate change, to ending hunger

83
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:55,826
and extreme poverty -- without the voices
and contributions of one billion Africans.

84
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,620
(Applause.)

85
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:07,066
Now, even with Africa’s impressive progress,
we must acknowledge that many of these gains

86
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:14,071
rest on a fragile foundation. Alongside new
wealth, hundreds of millions of Africans still

87
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:23,755
endure extreme poverty. Alongside high-tech
hubs of innovation, many Africans are crowded

88
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,470
into shantytowns without power or running
water -- a level of poverty that’s an assault

89
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,079
on human dignity.

90
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,748
Moreover, as the youngest and fastest-growing
continent, Africa’s population in the coming

91
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:44,430
decades will double to some two billion people,
and many of them will be young, under 18.

92
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:49,085
Now, on the one hand, this could bring tremendous
opportunities as these young Africans harness

93
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:58,444
new technologies and ignite new growth and
reforms. Economists will tell you that countries,

94
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:06,220
regions, continents grow faster with younger
populations. It's a demographic edge and advantage

95
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:15,490
-- but only if those young people are being
trained. We need only to look at the Middle

96
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:22,078
East and North Africa to see that large numbers
of young people with no jobs and stifled voices

97
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,531
can fuel instability and disorder.

98
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,658
I suggest to you that the most urgent task
facing Africa today and for decades ahead

99
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:45,927
is to create opportunity for this next generation.
(Applause.) And this will be an enormous undertaking.

100
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:52,812
Africa will need to generate millions more
jobs than it’s doing right now. And time

101
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,370
is of the essence. The choices made today
will shape the trajectory of Africa, and therefore,

102
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:07,476
the world for decades to come. And as your
partner and your friend, allow me to suggest

103
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,822
several ways that we can meet this challenge
together.

104
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:18,032
Africa’s progress will depend on unleashing
economic growth -- not just for the few at

105
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,922
the top, but for the many, because an essential
element of dignity is being able to live a

106
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:34,410
decent life. (Applause.) That begins with
a job. And that requires trade and investment.

107
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,567
Many of your nations have made important reforms
to attract investment -- it’s been a spark

108
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:48,110
for growth. But in many places across Africa,
it’s still too hard to start a venture,

109
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:53,490
still too hard to build a business. Governments
that take additional reforms to make doing

110
00:12:53,589 --> 00:13:00,626
business easier will have an eager partner
in the United States. (Applause.)

111
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,290
And that includes reforms to help Africa trade
more with itself -- as the Chairwoman and

112
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,328
I discussed before we came out here today
-- because the biggest markets for your goods

113
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:17,608
are often right next door. You don't have
to just look overseas for growth, you can

114
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:24,860
look internally. And our work to help Africa
modernize customs and border crossings started

115
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:28,435
with the East African Community -- now we’re
expanding our efforts across the continent,

116
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,240
because it shouldn’t be harder for African
countries to trade with each other than it

117
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,180
is for you to trade with Europe and America.
(Applause.)

118
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:46,167
Now, most U.S. trade with the region is with
just three countries -- South Africa, Nigeria

119
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:53,354
and Angola -- and much of that is in the form
of energy. I want Africans and Americans doing

120
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,647
more business together in more sectors, in
more countries. So we’re increasing trade

121
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:05,860
missions to places like Tanzania, Ethiopia
Mozambique. We’re working to help more Africans

122
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:10,915
get their goods to market. Next year, we’ll
host another U.S.-Africa Business Forum to

123
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:15,751
mobilize billions of dollars in new trade
and investment -- so we’re buying more of

124
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,331
each other’s products and all growing together.

125
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:25,970
Now, the United States isn’t the only country
that sees your growth as an opportunity. And

126
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:31,246
that is a good thing. When more countries
invest responsibly in Africa, it creates more

127
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:40,050
jobs and prosperity for us all. So I want
to encourage everybody to do business with

128
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:48,714
Africa, and African countries should want
to do business with every country. But economic

129
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,795
relationships can’t simply be about building
countries’ infrastructure with foreign labor

130
00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:00,145
or extracting Africa’s natural resources.
Real economic partnerships have to be a good

131
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:07,428
deal for Africa -- they have to create jobs
and capacity for Africans. (Applause.)

132
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:16,420
And that includes the point that Chairwoman
Zuma made about illicit flows with multinationals

133
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,141
-- which is one of the reasons that we've
been a leading advocate, working with the

134
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,532
G7, to assist in making sure that there’s
honest accounting when businesses are investing

135
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,742
here in Africa, and making sure that capital
flows are properly accounted for. That's the

136
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,100
kind of partnership America offers.

137
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:45,150
Nothing will unlock Africa’s economic potential
more than ending the cancer of corruption.

138
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:50,540
(Applause.) And you are right that it is not
just a problem of Africa, it is a problem

139
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:55,092
of those who do business with Africa. It is
not unique to Africa -- corruption exists

140
00:15:55,092 --> 00:16:01,551
all over the world, including in the United
States. But here in Africa, corruption drains

141
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:07,386
billions of dollars from economies that can't
afford to lose billions of dollars -- that's

142
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,550
money that could be used to create jobs and
build hospitals and schools. And when someone

143
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:19,814
has to pay a bribe just to start a business
or go to school, or get an official to do

144
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:26,393
the job they’re supposed to be doing anyway
-- that’s not “the African way.” (Applause.)

145
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:33,155
It undermines the dignity of the people you
represent.

146
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:40,752
Only Africans can end corruption in their
countries. As African governments commit to

147
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,550
taking action, the United States will work
with you to combat illicit financing, and

148
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,148
promote good governance and transparency and
rule of law. And we already have strong laws

149
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:58,277
in place that say to U.S. companies, you can't
engage in bribery to try to get business -- which

150
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,300
not all countries have. And we actually enforce
it and police it.

151
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:10,020
And let me add that criminal networks are
both fueling corruption and threatening Africa’s

152
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:14,536
precious wildlife -- and with it, the tourism
that many African economies count on. So America

153
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,230
also stands with you in the fight against
wildlife trafficking. That's something that

154
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:23,322
has to be addressed. (Applause.)

155
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:31,700
But, ultimately, the most powerful antidote
to the old ways of doing things is this new

156
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:37,044
generation of African youth. History shows
that the nations that do best are the ones

157
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:47,616
that invest in the education of their people.
(Applause.) You see, in this information age,

158
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,970
jobs can flow anywhere, and they typically
will flow to where workers are literate and

159
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:58,106
highly skilled and online. And Africa’s
young people are ready to compete. I've met

160
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:07,366
them -- they are hungry, they are eager. They’re
willing to work hard. So we've got to invest

161
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:16,190
in them. As Africa invests in education, our
entrepreneurship programs are helping innovators

162
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,646
start new businesses and create jobs right
here in Africa. And the men and women in our

163
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,451
Young African Leaders Initiative today will
be the leaders who can transform business

164
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,210
and civil society and governments tomorrow.

165
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:37,058
Africa’s progress will depend on development
that truly lifts countries from poverty to

166
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:48,120
prosperity -- because people everywhere deserve
the dignity of a life free from want. A child

167
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,017
born in Africa today is just as equal and
just as worthy as a child born in Asia or

168
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:59,039
Europe or America. At the recent development
conference here in Addis, African leadership

169
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:05,344
helped forge a new global compact for financing
that fuels development. And under the AU’s

170
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,360
leadership, the voice of a united Africa will
help shape the world’s next set of development

171
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:17,073
goals, and you’re pursuing a vision of the
future that you want for Africa.

172
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,232
And America’s approach to development -- the
central focus of our engagement with Africa

173
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:28,917
-- is focused on helping you build your own
capacity to realize that vision. Instead of

174
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,570
just shipping food aid to Africa, we’ve
helped more than two million farmers use new

175
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:39,109
techniques to boost their yields, feed more
people, reduce hunger. With our new alliance

176
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,060
of government and the private sector investing
billions of dollars in African agriculture,

177
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:50,020
I believe we can achieve our goal and lift
50 million Africans from poverty.

178
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:54,135
Instead of just sending aid to build power
plants, our Power Africa initiative is mobilizing

179
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:59,107
billions of dollars in investments from governments
and businesses to reduce the number of Africans

180
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:05,856
living without electricity. Now, an undertaking
of this magnitude will not be quick. It will

181
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,600
take many years. But working together, I believe
we can bring electricity to more than 60 million

182
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:19,965
African homes and businesses and connect more
Africans to the global economy. (Applause.)

183
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,610
Instead of just telling Africa, you’re on
your own, in dealing with climate change,

184
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:29,083
we’re delivering new tools and financing
to more than 40 African nations to help them

185
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:37,098
prepare and adapt. By harnessing the wind
and sun, your vast geothermal energy and rivers

186
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:43,144
for hydropower, you can turn this climate
threat into an economic opportunity. And I

187
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:49,072
urge Africa to join us in rejecting old divides
between North and South so we can forge a

188
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:54,151
strong global climate agreement this year
in Paris. Because sparing some of the world’s

189
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,710
poorest people from rising seas, more intense
droughts, shortages of water and food is a

190
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:06,510
matter of survival and a matter of human dignity.

191
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:11,161
Instead of just sending medicine, we’re
investing in better treatments and helping

192
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:18,630
Africa prevent and treat diseases. As the
United States continues to provide billions

193
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:23,121
of dollars in the fight against HIV/AIDS,
and as your countries take greater ownership

194
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:30,960
of health programs, we’re moving toward
a historic accomplishment -- the first AIDS-free

195
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:41,010
generation. (Applause.) And if the world learned
anything from Ebola, it’s that the best

196
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:46,098
way to prevent epidemics is to build strong
public health systems that stop diseases from

197
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:51,125
spreading in the first place. So America is
proud to partner with the AU and African countries

198
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:58,064
in this mission. Today, I can announce that
of the $1 billion that the United States is

199
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:08,710
devoting to this work globally, half will
support efforts here in Africa. (Applause.)

200
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:15,086
I believe Africa’s progress will also depend
on democracy, because Africans, like people

201
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:25,150
everywhere, deserve the dignity of being in
control of their own lives. (Applause.) We

202
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:33,050
all know what the ingredients of real democracy
are. They include free and fair elections,

203
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:40,097
but also freedom of speech and the press,
freedom of assembly. These rights are universal.

204
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:49,195
They’re written into African constitutions.
(Applause.) The African Charter on Human and

205
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:55,186
Peoples Rights declares that “every individual
shall have the right to the respect of the

206
00:22:56,086 --> 00:23:05,109
dignity inherent in a human being.” From
Sierra Leone, Ghana, Benin, to Botswana, Namibia,

207
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:12,978
South Africa, democracy has taken root. In
Nigeria, more than 28 million voters bravely

208
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:22,060
cast their ballots and power transferred as
it should -- peacefully. (Applause.)

209
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:32,120
Yet at this very moment, these same freedoms
are denied to many Africans. And I have to

210
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:49,671
proclaim, democracy is not just formal elections.
(Applause.) When journalists are put behind

211
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,779
bars for doing their jobs, or activists are
threatened as governments crack down on civil

212
00:23:55,779 --> 00:24:05,360
society -- (applause) -- then you may have
democracy in name, but not in substance. (Applause.)

213
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:11,935
And I'm convinced that nations cannot realize
the full promise of independence until they

214
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:16,260
fully protect the rights of their people.

215
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:23,990
And this is true even for countries that have
made important democratic progress. As I indicated

216
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:31,918
during my visit to Kenya, the remarkable gains
that country has made with a new constitution,

217
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:40,818
with its election, cannot be jeopardized by
restrictions on civil society. Likewise, our

218
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:46,950
host, Ethiopians have much to be proud of
-- I've been amazed at all the wonderful work

219
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:50,158
that's being done here -- and it's true that
the elections that took place here occurred

220
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:55,537
without violence. But as I discussed with
Prime Minister Hailemariam, that’s just

221
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:01,940
the start of democracy. I believe Ethiopia
will not fully unleash the potential of its

222
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:08,213
people if journalists are restricted or legitimate
opposition groups can't participate in the

223
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,210
campaign process. And, to his credit, the
Prime Minister acknowledged that more work

224
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:22,074
will need to be done for Ethiopia to be a
full-fledged, sustainable democracy. (Applause.)

225
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:28,148
So these are conversations we have to have
as friends. Our American democracy is not

226
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:40,048
perfect. We've worked for many years -- (applause)
-- but one thing we do is we continually reexamine

227
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:44,497
to figure out how can we make our democracy
better. And that's a force of strength for

228
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:53,460
us, being willing to look and see honestly
what we need to be doing to fulfill the promise

229
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:55,097
of our founding documents.

230
00:25:55,097 --> 00:26:03,098
And every country has to go through that process.
No country is perfect, but we have to be honest,

231
00:26:03,098 --> 00:26:12,177
and strive to expand freedoms, to broaden
democracy. The bottom line is that when citizens

232
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:18,084
cannot exercise their rights, the world has
a responsibility to speak out. And America

233
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:23,309
will, even if it’s sometimes uncomfortable
-- (applause) -- even when it’s sometimes

234
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,408
directed toward our friends.

235
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:30,360
And I know that there’s some countries that
don't say anything -- (laughter) -- and maybe

236
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:37,225
that's easier for leaders to deal with. (Laughter.)
But you're kind of stuck with us -- this is

237
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,648
how we are. (Applause.) We believe in these
things and we're going to keep on talking

238
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:42,611
about them.

239
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:48,460
And I want to repeat, we do this not because
we think our democracy is perfect, or we think

240
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:52,124
that every country has to follow precisely
our path. For more than two centuries since

241
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:57,033
our independence, we’re still working on
perfecting our union. We're not immune from

242
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:04,121
criticism. When we fall short of our ideals,
we strive to do better. (Applause.) But when

243
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:11,850
we speak out for our principles, at home and
abroad, we stay true to our values and we

244
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:19,052
help lift up the lives of people beyond our
borders. And we think that's important. And

245
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:24,350
it's especially important, I believe, for
those of us of African descent, because we've

246
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:30,204
known what it feels like to be on the receiving
end of injustice. We know what it means to

247
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:37,595
be discriminated against. (Applause.) We know
what it means to be jailed. So how can we

248
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,080
stand by when it's happening to somebody else?

249
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:47,687
I'll be frank with you, it can't just be America
that's talking about these things. Fellow

250
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:55,360
African countries have to talk about these
things. (Applause.) Just as other countries

251
00:27:55,036 --> 00:28:02,465
championed your break from colonialism, our
nations must all raise our voices when universal

252
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:10,090
rights are being denied. For if we truly believe
that Africans are equal in dignity, then Africans

253
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,468
have an equal right to freedoms that are universal
-- that’s a principle we all have to defend.

254
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:23,610
(Applause.) And it's not just a Western idea;
it's a human idea.

255
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,960
I have to also say that Africa’s democratic
progress is also at risk when leaders refuse

256
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:46,195
to step aside when their terms end. (Applause.)
Now, let me be honest with you -- I do not

257
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:59,182
understand this. (Laughter.) I am in my second
term. It has been an extraordinary privilege

258
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:05,051
for me to serve as President of the United
States. I cannot imagine a greater honor or

259
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:16,100
a more interesting job. I love my work. But
under our Constitution, I cannot run again.

260
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:24,009
(Laughter and applause.) I can't run again.
I actually think I'm a pretty good President

261
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,398
-- I think if I ran I could win. (Laughter
and applause.) But I can't.

262
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:46,336
So there’s a lot that I'd like to do to
keep America moving, but the law is the law.

263
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:55,970
(Applause.) And no one person is above the
law. Not even the President. (Applause.) And

264
00:29:55,097 --> 00:30:02,162
I'll be honest with you -- I’m looking forward
to life after being President. (Laughter.)

265
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:07,147
I won't have such a big security detail all
the time. (Laughter.) It means I can go take

266
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:14,616
a walk. I can spend time with my family. I
can find other ways to serve. I can visit

267
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:28,610
Africa more often. (Applause.) The point is,
I don't understand why people want to stay

268
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:41,880
so long. (Laughter.) Especially when they’ve
got a lot of money. (Laughter and applause.)

269
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:54,820
When a leader tries to change the rules in
the middle of the game just to stay in office,

270
00:30:54,082 --> 00:31:05,401
it risks instability and strife -- as we’ve
seen in Burundi. (Applause.) And this is often

271
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:11,213
just a first step down a perilous path. And
sometimes you’ll hear leaders say, well,

272
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:16,884
I'm the only person who can hold this nation
together. (Laughter.) If that's true, then

273
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:21,830
that leader has failed to truly build their
nation. (Applause.)

274
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:29,144
You look at Nelson Mandela -- Madiba, like
George Washington, forged a lasting legacy

275
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:33,121
not only because of what they did in office,
but because they were willing to leave office

276
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:45,057
and transfer power peacefully. (Applause.)
And just as the African Union has condemned

277
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:51,062
coups and illegitimate transfers of power,
the AU’s authority and strong voice can

278
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:55,491
also help the people of Africa ensure that
their leaders abide by term limits and their

279
00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:00,570
constitutions. (Applause.) Nobody should be
president for life.

280
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:11,057
And your country is better off if you have
new blood and new ideas. (Applause.) I'm still

281
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:19,096
a pretty young man, but I know that somebody
with new energy and new insights will be good

282
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:27,895
for my country. (Applause.) It will be good
for yours, too, in some cases.

283
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:34,360
Africa’s progress will also depend on security
and peace -- because an essential part of

284
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:42,075
human dignity is being safe and free from
fear. In Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra

285
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:50,405
Leone, we’ve seen conflicts end and countries
work to rebuild. But from Somalia and Nigeria

286
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:57,460
to Mali and Tunisia, terrorists continue to
target innocent civilians. Many of these groups

287
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:02,121
claim the banner of religion, but hundreds
of millions of African Muslims know that Islam

288
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:15,034
means peace. (Applause.) And we must call
groups 
like al Qaeda, ISIL, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram

289
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:23,112
-- we must call them what they are -- murderers.
(Applause.)

290
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:29,701
In the face of threats, Africa -- and the
African Union --has shown leadership. Because

291
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:33,820
of the AU force in Somalia,
al-Shabaab controls less territory and the

292
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:39,147
Somali government is growing stronger. In
central Africa, the AU-led mission continues

293
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:46,121
to degrade the Lord’s Resistance Army. In
the Lake Chad Basin, forces from several nations

294
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:52,860
-- with the backing of the AU -- are fighting
to end Boko Haram’s senseless brutality.

295
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:57,132
And today, we salute all those who serve to
protect the innocent, including so many brave

296
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,980
African peacekeepers.

297
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:04,677
Now, as Africa stands against terror and conflict,
I want you to know that the United States

298
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:11,595
stands with you. With training and support,
we’re helping African forces grow stronger.

299
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,950
The United States is supporting the AU’s
efforts to strengthen peacekeeping, and we’re

300
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:19,954
working with countries in the region to deal
with emerging crises with the African Peacekeeping

301
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,846
Rapid Response Partnership.

302
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,273
The world must do more to help as well. This
fall at the United Nations, I will host a

303
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,138
summit to secure new commitments to strengthen
international support for peacekeeping, including

304
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:40,362
here in Africa. And building on commitments
that originated here in the AU, we’ll work

305
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:44,898
to develop a new partnership between the U.N.
and the AU that can provide reliable support

306
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:52,040
for AU peace operations. If African governments
and international partners step up with strong

307
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:59,077
support, we can transform how we work together
to promote security and peace in Africa.

308
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:02,171
Our efforts to ensure our shared security
must be matched by a commitment to improve

309
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:09,670
governance. Those things are connected. Good
governance is one of the best weapons against

310
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:15,334
terrorism and instability. Our fight against
terrorist groups, for example, will never

311
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:23,170
be won if we fail to address legitimate grievances
that terrorists may try to exploit, if we

312
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:28,019
don’t build trust with all communities,
if we don’t uphold the rule of law. There’s

313
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:32,688
a saying, and I believe it is true -- if we
sacrifice liberty in the name of security,

314
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:38,390
we risk losing both. (Applause.)

315
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:45,096
This same seriousness of purpose is needed
to end conflicts. In the Central African Republic,

316
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:50,155
the spirit of dialogue recently shown by ordinary
citizens must be matched by leaders committed

317
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:57,074
to inclusive elections and a peaceful transition.
In Mali, the comprehensive peace agreement

318
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:02,720
must be fulfilled. And leaders in Sudan must
know their nation will never truly thrive

319
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:06,074
so long as they wage war against their own
people -- the world will not forget about

320
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:06,173
Darfur.

321
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:13,102
In South Sudan, the joy of independence has
descended into the despair of violence. I

322
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:26,351
was there at the United Nations when we held
up South Sudan as the promise of a new beginning.

323
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,413
And neither Mr. Kiir, nor Mr. Machar have
shown, so far, any interest in sparing their

324
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,520
people from this suffering, or reaching a
political solution.

325
00:36:34,052 --> 00:36:40,140
Yesterday, I met with leaders from this region.
We agree that, given the current situation,

326
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:47,011
Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar must reach an agreement
by August 17th -- because if they do not,

327
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:52,049
I believe the international community must
raise the costs of intransigence. And the

328
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:56,165
world awaits the report of the AU Commission
of Inquiry, because accountability for atrocities

329
00:36:57,065 --> 00:37:06,140
must be part of any lasting peace in Africa’s
youngest nation. (Applause.)

330
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:10,052
And finally, Africa’s progress will depend
on upholding the human rights of all people

331
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:19,147
-- for if each of us is to be treated with
dignity, each of us must be sure to also extend

332
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:26,123
that same dignity to others. As President,
I make it a point to meet with many of our

333
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:31,114
Young African Leaders. And one was a young
man from Senegal. He said something wonderful

334
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:38,023
about being together with so many of his African
brothers and sisters. He said, “Here, I

335
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:45,076
have met Africa, the [Africa] I’ve always
believed in. She’s beautiful. She’s young.

336
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:52,153
She’s full of talent and motivation and
ambition.” I agree.

337
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:58,138
Africa is the beautiful, talented daughters
who are just as capable as Africa’s sons.

338
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:05,043
(Applause.) And as a father, I believe that
my two daughters have to have the same chance

339
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:11,130
to pursue their dreams as anybody’s son
-- and that same thing holds true for girls

340
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:17,007
here in Africa. (Applause.) Our girls have
to be treated the same.

341
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:23,106
We can’t let old traditions stand in the
way. The march of history shows that we have

342
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:30,143
the capacity to broaden our moral imaginations.
We come to see that some traditions are good

343
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:37,048
for us, they keep us grounded, but that, in
our modern world, other traditions set us

344
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:46,074
back. When African girls are subjected to
the mutilation of their bodies, or forced

345
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:53,933
into marriage at the ages of 9 or 10 or 11
-- that sets us back. That's not a good tradition.

346
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,760
It needs to end. (Applause.)

347
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:06,625
When more than 80 percent of new HIV cases
in the hardest-hit countries are teenage girls,

348
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:13,365
that’s a tragedy; that sets us back. So
America is beginning a partnership with 10

349
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:21,170
African countries -- Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,

350
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:26,046
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- to keep teenage
girls safe and AIDS-free. (Applause.) And

351
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:37,105
when girls cannot go to school and grow up
not knowing how to read or write -- that denies

352
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:45,071
the world future women engineers, future women
doctors, future women business owners, future

353
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:50,097
women presidents -- that sets us all back.
(Applause.) That's a bad tradition -- not

354
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:55,121
providing our girls the same education as
our sons.

355
00:39:56,021 --> 00:40:00,910
I was saying in Kenya, nobody would put out
a football team and then just play half the

356
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:12,172
team. You’d lose. (Applause.) the same is
true when it comes to getting everybody and

357
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:20,960
education. You can't leave half the team off
-- our young women. So as part of America’s

358
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:24,179
support for the education and the health of
our daughters, my wife, Michelle, is helping

359
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,175
to lead a global campaign, including a new
effort in Tanzania and Malawi, with a simple

360
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:35,100
message -- Let Girls Learn -- let girls learn
so they grow up healthy and they grow up strong.

361
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,066
(Applause.) And that will be good for families.
And they will raise smart, healthy children,

362
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:45,485
and that will be good for every one of your
nations.

363
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,280
Africa is the beautiful, strong women that
these girls grow up to become. The single

364
00:40:52,028 --> 00:41:01,041
best indicator of whether a nation will succeed
is how it treats its women. (Applause.) When

365
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:07,240
women have health care and women have education,
families are stronger, communities are more

366
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:14,656
prosperous, children do better in school,
nations are more prosperous. Look at the amazing

367
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:24,900
African women here in this hall. (Applause.)
If you want your country to grow and succeed,

368
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:28,010
you have to empower your women. And if you
want to empower more women, America will be

369
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:35,094
your partner. (Applause.)
Let’s work together to stop sexual assault

370
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:41,180
and domestic violence. Let’s make clear
that we will not tolerate rape as a weapon

371
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:48,010
of war -- it’s a crime. (Applause.) And
those who commit it must be punished. Let’s

372
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:52,039
lift up the next generation of women leaders
who can help fight injustice and forge peace

373
00:41:52,039 --> 00:42:00,978
and start new businesses and create jobs -- and
some might hire some men, too. (Laughter.)

374
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:10,380
We’ll all be better off when women have
equal futures.

375
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:14,123
And Africa is the beautiful tapestry of your
cultures and ethnicities and races and religions.

376
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:25,075
Last night, we saw this amazing dance troupe
made up of street children who had formed

377
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:30,874
a dance troupe and they performed for the
Prime Minister and myself. And there were

378
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:36,940
80 different languages and I don't know how
many ethnic groups. And there were like 30

379
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:39,125
different dances that were being done. And
the Prime Minister was trying to keep up with

380
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:51,053
-- okay, I think that one is -- (laughter)
-- and they were moving fast. And that diversity

381
00:42:51,053 --> 00:42:57,126
here in Ethiopia is representative of diversity
all throughout Africa. (Applause.) And that's

382
00:42:58,026 --> 00:42:58,825
a strength.

383
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:05,170
Now, yesterday, I had the privilege to view
Lucy -- you may know Lucy -- she’s our ancestor,

384
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:14,019
more than 3 million years old. (Applause.)
In this tree of humanity, with all of our

385
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:22,093
branches and diversity, we all go back to
the same root. We’re all one family -- we're

386
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:31,120
all one tribe. And yet so much of the suffering
in our world stems from our failure to remember

387
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:38,073
that -- to not recognize ourselves in each
other. (Applause.)

388
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:43,103
We think because somebody’s skin is slightly
different, or their hair is slightly different,

389
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:52,027
or their religious faith is differently expressed,
or they speak a different language that it

390
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:58,034
justifies somehow us treating them with less
dignity. And that becomes the source of so

391
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:02,226
many of our problems. And we think somehow
that we make ourselves better by putting other

392
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:09,520
people down. And that becomes the source of
so many of our problems. When we begin to

393
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:16,351
see other as somehow less than ourselves -- when
we succumb to these artificial divisions of

394
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:24,868
faith or sect or tribe or ethnicity -- then
even the most awful abuses are justified in

395
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:32,270
the minds of those who are thinking in those
ways. And in the end, abusers lose their own

396
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:39,069
humanity, as well. (Applause.)

397
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:44,095
Nelson Mandela taught us, “to be free is
not merely to cast off one’s chains, but

398
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:48,169
to live in a way that respects and enhances
the freedom of others.”

399
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:53,071
Every one of us is equal. Every one of us
has worth. Every one of us matters. And when

400
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:57,788
we respect the freedom of others -- no matter
the color of their skin, or how they pray

401
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:09,700
or who they are or who they love -- we are
all more free. (Applause.) Your dignity depends

402
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:15,102
on my dignity, and my dignity depends on yours.
Imagine if everyone had that spirit in their

403
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:25,074
hearts. Imagine if governments operated that
way. (Applause.) Just imagine what the world

404
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:29,118
could look like -- the future that we could
bequeath these young people.

405
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:36,097
Yes, in our world, old thinking can be a stubborn
thing. That's one of the reasons why we need

406
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:44,100
term limits -- old people think old ways.
And you can see my grey hair, I'm getting

407
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:51,616
old. (Laughter.) The old ways can be stubborn.
But I believe the human heart is stronger.

408
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,935
I believe hearts can change. I believe minds
can open. That’s how change happens. That’s

409
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:05,490
how societies move forward. It's not always
a straight line -- step by halting step -- sometimes

410
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:10,148
you go forward, you move back a little bit.
But I believe we are marching, we are pointing

411
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:14,147
towards ideals of justice and equality.

412
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:20,658
That’s how your nations won independence
-- not just with rifles, but with principles

413
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:26,260
and ideals. (Applause.) That's how African
Americans won our civil rights. That's how

414
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:32,045
South Africans -- black and white -- tore
down apartheid. That's why I can stand before

415
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:39,064
you today as the first African American President
of the United States. (Applause.)

416
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:47,115
New thinking. Unleashing growth that creates
opportunity. Promoting development that lifts

417
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:54,078
all people out of poverty. Supporting democracy
that gives citizens their say. Advancing the

418
00:46:54,078 --> 00:47:01,667
security and justice that delivers peace.
Respecting the human rights of all people.

419
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:07,200
These are the keys to progress -- not just
in Africa, but around the world. And this

420
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:08,059
is the work that we can do together.

421
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:15,084
And I am hopeful. As I prepare to return home,
my thoughts are with that same young man from

422
00:47:16,047 --> 00:47:20,676
Senegal, who said: Here, I have met Africa,
the [Africa] I’ve always believed in. She’s

423
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:27,196
beautiful and young, full of talent and motivation
and ambition. To which I would simply add,

424
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:32,142
as you build the Africa you believe in, you
will have no better partner, no better friend

425
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:35,490
than the United States of America. (Applause.)

426
00:47:35,049 --> 00:48:00,073
God bless Africa. God bless the United States
of America. Thank you very much, everybody.

427
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:21,141
Thank you. (Applause.)
