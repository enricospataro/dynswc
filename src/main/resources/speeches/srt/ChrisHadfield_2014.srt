1
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:17,367
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

2
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,417
Or another way to say it is,

3
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:23,891
what's the most dangerous 
thing that you've ever done?

4
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:28,074
And why did you do it?

5
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:29,692
I know what the most dangerous thing is

6
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,885
that I've ever done

7
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,169
because NASA does the math.

8
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,521
You look back to the first five shuttle launches,

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,109
the odds of a catastrophic event

10
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,689
during the first five shuttle launches

11
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,613
was one in nine.

12
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:44,511
And even when I first flew in the shuttle

13
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,199
back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,

14
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,189
the odds were still now that we look back

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:54,857
about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.

16
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:57,424
Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day

17
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,716
when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center

18
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:02,086
and you're going to go to space that day

19
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:03,821
because you realize by the end of the day

20
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,451
you're either going to be floating 
effortlessly, gloriously in space,

21
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,568
or you'll be dead.

22
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,928
You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,

23
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:15,918
the suit-up room,

24
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:20,173
the same room that our childhood heroes

25
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,431
got dressed in,

26
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,406
that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in

27
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,547
to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.

28
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:30,014
And I got my pressure suit built around me

29
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:33,876
and rode down outside in the van

30
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,451
heading out to the launchpad --

31
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,353
in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,

32
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,462
and as you come around the corner

33
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,467
at the Kennedy Space Center,

34
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,837
it's normally predawn, and in the distance,

35
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,854
lit up by the huge xenon lights,

36
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:52,269
is your spaceship --

37
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:56,109
the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.

38
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,713
The crew is sitting in the Astro van

39
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:00,828
sort of hushed, almost holding hands,

40
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,377
looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.

41
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:05,820
We ride the elevator up

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,175
and we crawl in, on your hands and knees

43
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:09,823
into the spaceship, one at a time,

44
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:11,470
and you worm your way up

45
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,037
into your chair and plunk yourself down

46
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:16,325
on your back.

47
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:20,273
And the hatch is closed,

48
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,420
and suddenly,

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,090
what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial

50
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,545
is becoming real,

51
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:29,618
something that I dreamed about,

52
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:32,165
in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,

53
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:35,539
is now suddenly within not too many minutes

54
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,397
of actually happening.

55
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:40,080
In the astronaut business --

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,953
the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;

57
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,764
it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.

58
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:49,125
And in the astronaut business, 
we have a saying, which is,

59
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,093
there is no problem so bad

60
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,413
that you can't make it worse.

61
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,651
(Laughter)

62
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,753
And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;

63
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:59,191
you're thinking about all of the things

64
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,382
that you might have to do,

65
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,693
all the switches and all the 
wickets you have to go through.

66
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:04,886
And as the time gets closer and closer,

67
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,555
this excitement is building.

68
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:08,715
And then about three and a 
half minutes before launch,

69
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:10,522
the huge nozzles on the back,

70
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,206
like the size of big church bells,

71
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,335
swing back and forth

72
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,680
and the mass of them is such

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,377
that it sways the whole vehicle,

74
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:19,261
like the vehicle is alive underneath you,

75
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,915
like an elephant getting up 
off its knees or something.

76
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,211
And then about 30 seconds before launch,

77
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,043
the vehicle is completely alive --

78
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,250
it is ready to go --

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,411
the APUs are running,

80
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,280
the computers are all self-contained,

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,769
it's ready to leave the planet.

82
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,057
And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:

83
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:40,495
(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,

84
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:44,523
nine, eight, seven, six --

85
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:47,071
(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)

86
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,963
-- start, two, one,

87
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:54,106
booster ignition, and liftoff of 
the space shuttle Discovery,

88
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:58,137
returning to the space station, paving the way ...

89
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:09,704
(Space shuttle taking off)

90
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:12,981
Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful

91
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,784
to be on board one of these things.

92
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,815
You are in the grip of something

93
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,012
that is vastly more powerful than yourself.

94
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,635
It's shaking you so hard you can't focus

95
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,082
on the instruments in front of you.

96
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,998
It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog

97
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,744
and there's a foot in the small of your back

98
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,271
pushing you into space,

99
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,320
accelerating wildly straight up,

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,022
shouldering your way through the air,

101
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,553
and you're in a very complex place --

102
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:38,358
paying attention, watching the vehicle

103
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,009
go through each one of its wickets

104
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,430
with a steadily increasing smile on your face.

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,627
After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off

106
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:48,041
and then you just have the liquid engines,

107
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,494
the hydrogen and oxygen,

108
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,961
and it's as if you're in a dragster

109
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:52,736
with your foot to the floor

110
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:55,155
and accelerating like you've never accelerated.

111
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,470
You get lighter and lighter,

112
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,896
the force gets on us heavier and heavier.

113
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,272
It feels like

114
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,356
someone's pouring cement on you or something.

115
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:03,640
Until finally,

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,308
after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,

117
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,503
we are finally at exactly the right altitude,

118
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:10,585
exactly the right speed,

119
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,665
the right direction, the engine shut off,

120
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,887
and we're weightless.

121
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,789
And we're alive.

122
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,245
It's an amazing experience.

123
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:23,553
But why would we take that risk?

124
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:27,273
Why would you do something that dangerous?

125
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,342
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.

126
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,396
I was inspired as a youngster

127
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,987
that this was what I wanted to do.

128
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,180
I watched the first people walk on the moon

129
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,411
and to me, it was just an obvious thing --

130
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,413
I want to somehow turn myself into that.

131
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,595
But the real question is,

132
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,210
how do you deal with the danger of it

133
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,366
and the fear that comes from it?

134
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:51,064
How do you deal with fear versus danger?

135
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:54,131
And having the goal in mind,
thinking about where it might lead,

136
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,940
directed me to a life of

137
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,285
looking at all of the small details to allow

138
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,986
this to become possible,

139
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,895
to be able to launch and go 
help build a space station

140
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,355
where you are on board a million-pound creation

141
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:09,191
that's going around the world at five miles a second,

142
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:10,566
eight kilometers a second,

143
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,075
around the world 16 times a day,

144
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:17,060
with experiments on board that are teaching us

145
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,052
what the substance of the universe is made of

146
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,638
and running 200 experiments inside.

147
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,486
But maybe even more importantly,

148
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:27,303
allowing us to see the world in a way

149
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,925
that is impossible through any other means,

150
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,464
to be able to look down

151
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,767
and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --

152
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,757
the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb

153
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:43,520
like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,231
constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.

155
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,766
And you see, because of the speed,

156
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:52,592
a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes

157
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,761
for half a year.

158
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:58,212
And the most magnificent part of all that

159
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,011
is to go outside on a spacewalk.

160
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:06,419
You are in a one-person spaceship

161
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,887
that is your spacesuit,

162
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:11,651
and you're going through space with the world.

163
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:13,404
It's an entirely different perspective,

164
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:14,819
you're not looking up at the universe,

165
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,301
you and the Earth are going 
through the universe together.

166
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,100
And you're holding on with one hand,

167
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,224
looking at the world turn beside you.

168
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:26,016
It's roaring silently

169
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,785
with color and texture as it pours by

170
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,761
mesmerizingly next to you.

171
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,447
And if you can tear your eyes away from that

172
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:34,909
and you look under your arm

173
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,147
down at the rest of everything,

174
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:42,544
it's unfathomable blackness,

175
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,612
with a texture you feel like you 
could stick your hand into.

176
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:48,027
and you are holding on with one hand,

177
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,452
one link to the other seven billion people.

178
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,590
And I was outside on my first spacewalk

179
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,366
when my left eye went blind,

180
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,036
and I didn't know why.

181
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,646
Suddenly my left eye slammed shut

182
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,770
in great pain

183
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,829
and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.

184
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,185
I was thinking, what do I do next?

185
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,440
I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,

186
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,693
so I kept working.

187
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:13,032
But unfortunately, without gravity,

188
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,962
tears don't fall.

189
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,986
So you just get a bigger and 
bigger ball of whatever that is

190
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,994
mixed with your tears on your eye

191
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,472
until eventually, the ball becomes so big

192
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:25,033
that the surface tension takes it 
across the bridge of your nose

193
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,767
like a tiny little waterfall

194
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,842
and goes "goosh" into your other eye,

195
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,310
and now I was completely blind

196
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,408
outside the spaceship.

197
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,987
So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

198
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:41,689
(Laughter)

199
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,169
Maybe it's spiders.

200
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,698
A lot of people are afraid of spiders.

201
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,427
I think you should be afraid of spiders --

202
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:49,110
spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,

203
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,537
and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --

204
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,679
it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,

205
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,413
you end with one of these 
horrible, big necrotic things

206
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,516
on your leg

207
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,769
and there might be one right now

208
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,847
sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.

209
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:02,932
And how do you know?

210
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:04,306
And so a spider lands on you,

211
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:06,347
and you go through this great, spasmy attack

212
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,075
because spiders are scary.

213
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:10,579
But then you could say, well 
is there a brown recluse

214
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:11,954
sitting on the chair beside me or not?

215
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,968
I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?

216
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:16,651
So if you actually do the research, you find out that

217
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,696
in the world there are about 
50,000 different types of spiders,

218
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:22,371
and there are about two dozen that are venomous

219
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,722
out of 50,000.

220
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,090
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters

221
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,570
here in B.C., there's about 720, 
730 different types of spiders

222
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,472
and there's one -- one --

223
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,331
that is venomous,

224
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:35,037
and its venom isn't even fatal,

225
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,938
it's just kind of like a nasty sting.

226
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,863
And that spider -- not only that,

227
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:42,076
but that spider has beautiful markings on it,

228
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:46,224
it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation 
symbol on my back, it's the black widow."

229
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,482
So, if you're even slightly careful

230
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,924
you can avoid running into the one spider --

231
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,070
and it lives close the ground,

232
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,522
you're walking along, you are 
never going to go through

233
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,372
a spider web where a black widow bites you.

234
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,345
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,

235
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,975
it builds them down in the corners.

236
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,567
And its a black widow because

237
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,906
the female spider eats the male;

238
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:05,697
it doesn't care about you.

239
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,162
So in fact,

240
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,461
the next time you walk into a spiderweb,

241
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:13,336
you don't need to panic and go 
with your caveman reaction.

242
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:17,925
The danger is entirely different than the fear.

243
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,258
How do you get around it, though?

244
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:21,512
How do you change your behavior?

245
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:22,996
Well, next time you see a spiderweb,

246
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,210
have a good look, make sure 
it's not a black widow spider,

247
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,002
and then walk into it.

248
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,640
And then you see another spiderweb

249
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,862
and walk into that one.

250
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,108
It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.

251
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:35,624
And the spider that may come out is 
no more threat to you than a lady bug

252
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:38,492
or a butterfly.

253
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,420
And then I guarantee you if you 
walk through 100 spiderwebs

254
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,008
you will have changed

255
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,563
your fundamental human behavior,

256
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,068
your caveman reaction,

257
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,895
and you will now be able to walk 
in the park in the morning

258
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,684
and not worry about that spiderweb --

259
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,144
or into your grandma's attic or whatever,

260
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:59,229
into your own basement.

261
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:02,740
And you can apply this to anything.

262
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,555
If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,

263
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:08,179
your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.

264
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,239
It would make you nervous and worried.

265
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,727
But we had considered all the venom,

266
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:15,608
and we had practiced with a whole 
variety of different spiderwebs.

267
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,342
We knew everything there is to know

268
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,800
about the spacesuit

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,313
and we trained underwater thousands of times.

270
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,044
And we don't just practice things going right,

271
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:25,868
we practice things going wrong all the time,

272
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:29,132
so that you are constantly walking 
through those spiderwebs.

273
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:32,209
And not just underwater, but 
also in virtual reality labs

274
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,600
with the helmet and the gloves

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,007
so you feel like it's realistic.

276
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:38,335
So when you finally actually 
get outside on a spacewalk,

277
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:40,297
it feels much different than it would

278
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:42,135
if you just went out first time.

279
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,896
And even if you're blinded,

280
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:47,542
your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.

281
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,901
Instead you kind of look around and go,

282
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,553
"Okay, I can't see,

283
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,975
but I can hear, I can talk,

284
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:54,704
Scott Parazynski is out here with me.

285
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,135
He could come over and help me."

286
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,049
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,

287
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,840
so he could float me like a blimp

288
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,015
and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.

289
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,215
I could find my own way back.

290
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:07,585
It's not nearly as big a deal.

291
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:09,607
And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,

292
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:12,002
whatever that gunk was that's 
in your eye starts to dilute

293
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,522
and you can start to see again,

294
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:15,589
and Houston, if you negotiate with them,

295
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,586
they will let you then keep working.

296
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,645
We finished everything on the spacewalk

297
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,242
and when we came back inside,

298
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,965
Jeff got some cotton batting and took 
the crusty stuff around my eyes,

299
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,417
and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,

300
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,864
sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.

301
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:35,412
And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,

302
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,727
which we probably should've been using

303
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,363
right from the very beginning. (Laughter)

304
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:45,309
But the key to that is

305
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,864
by looking at the difference

306
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,859
between perceived danger and actual danger,

307
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,226
where is the real risk?

308
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,280
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?

309
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,048
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.

310
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:57,415
You can fundamentally change 
your reaction to things

311
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:00,352
so that it allows you to go places

312
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,989
and see things and do things

313
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,485
that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...

314
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,832
where you could see the 
hardpan south of the Sahara,

315
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:09,784
or you can see New York City

316
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,883
in a way that is almost dreamlike,

317
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:16,406
or the unconscious gingham 
of Eastern Europe fields

318
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,537
or the Great Lakes

319
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,278
as a collection of small puddles.

320
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:24,523
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco

321
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:26,421
and the way the water pours out under the bridge,

322
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,153
just entirely different

323
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:29,822
than any other way that you could have

324
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:33,105
if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.

325
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,544
You see a beauty that otherwise

326
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,021
never would have happened.

327
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,268
It's time to come home at the end.

328
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,587
This is our spaceship,

329
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:43,694
the Soyuz, that little one.

330
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,159
Three of us climb in,

331
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,611
and then this spaceship detaches from the station

332
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,281
and falls into the atmosphere.

333
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:50,903
These two parts here

334
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:53,067
actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up

335
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,149
in the atmosphere.

336
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,402
The only part that survives is the little bullet

337
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,578
that we're riding in,

338
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:59,616
and it falls into the atmosphere,

339
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,192
and in essence

340
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:04,753
you are riding a meteorite home,

341
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:07,686
and riding meteorites is scary,

342
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,199
and it ought to be.

343
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,438
But instead of riding into the atmosphere

344
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:12,676
just screaming, like you would

345
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:15,021
if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite

346
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,951
back to Earth -- (Laughter) --

347
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,375
instead, 20 years previously

348
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,991
we had started studying Russian,

349
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,571
and then once you learn Russian, then we

350
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,085
learned orbital mechanics in Russian,

351
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:31,055
and then we learned vehicle control theory,

352
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,524
and then we got into the simulator

353
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,096
and practiced over and over and over again.

354
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:37,106
And in fact, you can fly this meteorite

355
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,315
and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle

356
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,739
anywhere on the Earth.

357
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:43,664
So in fact, when our crew was coming back

358
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,224
into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,

359
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:48,600
we weren't screaming, we were laughing;

360
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,668
it was fun.

361
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,596
And when the great big parachute opened,

362
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:52,815
we knew that if it didn't open

363
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,030
there's a second parachute,

364
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,211
and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.

365
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,593
So we came back, we came thundering back

366
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,479
to Earth and this is what it looked like

367
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,079
to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.

368
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,102
(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those

369
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,818
search and recovery helicopters, once again

370
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:10,829
that helicopter part of dozen such Russian

371
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,457
Mi-8 helicopters.

372
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,366
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,

373
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,841
a.m. Central Time.

374
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,012
CH: And you roll to a stop

375
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,681
as if someone threw your 
spaceship at the ground

376
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,063
and it tumbles end over end,

377
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,069
but you're ready for it

378
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:27,445
you're in a custom-built seat,

379
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:28,882
you know how the shock absorber works.

380
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:30,873
And then eventually the Russians reach in,

381
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:32,031
drag you out,

382
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,731
plunk you into a chair,

383
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:37,174
and you can now look back at

384
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:40,356
what was an incredible experience.

385
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,323
You have taken the dreams of that

386
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:43,935
nine-year-old boy,

387
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,574
which were impossible

388
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,464
and dauntingly scary,

389
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,164
dauntingly terrifying,

390
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:52,888
and put them into practice,

391
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:56,121
and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,

392
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,249
to change your primal fear

393
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,148
so that it allowed you to come back

394
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:05,088
with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration

395
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,431
for other people

396
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,557
that never could have been possible otherwise.

397
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,167
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.

398
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,427
I know this song,

399
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:24,647
and it's really a tribute to the genius

400
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,680
of David Bowie himself,

401
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,593
but it's also, I think,

402
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:31,031
a reflection of the fact that we are not machines

403
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,364
exploring the universe,

404
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,477
we are people,

405
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:35,641
and we're taking

406
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:37,817
that ability to adapt

407
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,347
and that ability to understand

408
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:41,323
and the ability to take

409
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:45,682
our own self-perception into a new place.

410
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:51,919
(Music)

411
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,592
♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫

412
00:16:56,592 --> 00:17:01,651
♫ I've left forevermore ♫

413
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:08,458
♫ And I'm floating in a most peculiar way ♫

414
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:15,563
♫ And the stars look very different today ♫

415
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:23,017
♫ For here am I floating in the tin can ♫

416
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:29,847
♫ A last glimpse of the world ♫

417
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:37,025
♫ Planet Earth is blue and 
there's so much left to do ♫

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:56,603
(Music)

419
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,129
Fear not.

420
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:11,372
(Applause)

421
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:14,558
That's very nice of you. Thank you very much.

422
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,725
Thank you.
