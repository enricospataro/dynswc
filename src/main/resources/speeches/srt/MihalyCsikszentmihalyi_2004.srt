1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
when I was between seven and 10 years old.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,820
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:37,820
were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:45,820
how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,820
satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
was destroyed by the war.

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
So I became interested in understanding

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,820
what contributed to a life that was worth living.

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,820
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,820
and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,820
that I could see as a possible answer to that question.

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.

14
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,820
I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money

15
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:44,820
to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and

16
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --

17
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,820
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,

21
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,820
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:23,820
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.

23
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Instead of talking about little green men,

24
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,820
he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans

25
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting

26
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
flying saucers into the sky.

27
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,820
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion

28
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,820
were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,820
some sense of order after the chaos of war.

30
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
And this seemed very interesting to me.

31
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
And I started reading his books after that lecture.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:09,820
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.

33
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
Then I came to this country to study psychology

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,820
and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,820
This is a typical result that many people have presented,

36
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and there are many variations on it.

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,820
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
surveyed in the United States since 1956

39
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,820
say that their life is very happy.

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And that hasn't changed at all.

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Whereas the personal income,

42
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,820
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,

43
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,820
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.

44
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,820
But you find essentially the same results,

45
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less

46
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --

47
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,820
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.

48
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,820
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
material resources, contributes to unhappiness,

50
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,820
but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.

51
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,820
So my research has been focused more on --

52
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,820
after finding out these things that actually corresponded

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
to my own experience, I tried to understand:

54
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,820
where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --

55
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
do we feel really happy?

56
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And to start

57
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --

58
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,820
first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand

59
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:18,820
what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life

60
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,820
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,

61
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,820
but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.

62
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,820
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.

63
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
And the interview was 40 pages long.

64
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,820
But this little excerpt is a very good summary

65
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,820
of what he was saying during the interview.

66
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,820
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.

67
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.

68
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Now, "ecstasy" in Greek meant

69
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
simply to stand to the side of something.

70
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,820
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state

71
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,820
where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.

72
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,820
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.

73
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about

74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,820
the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --

75
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,820
whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,

76
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,820
or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them

77
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,820
is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.

78
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We know the temples they built, where people could come

79
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
to experience a different reality.

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
We know about the circuses,

81
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
the arenas, the theaters.

82
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:04,820
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went

83
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:13,820
to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.

84
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,

85
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built

86
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,820
like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.

87
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
We are participating in a reality that is different

88
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
from that of the everyday life that we're used to.

89
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
But this man doesn't need to go there.

90
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,820
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,

91
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,820
and as he does that, he can imagine sounds

92
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
that had not existed before in that particular combination.

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,820
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,

94
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
like Jennifer did in her improvisation,

95
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,820
a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --

96
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
he enters that different reality.

97
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience

98
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.

99
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,820
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.

100
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,820
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,820
more than about 110 bits of information per second.

102
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,820
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,820
you need to process about 60 bits per second.

104
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
That's why you can't hear more than two people.

105
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.

106
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process

107
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
of creating something new, as this man is,

108
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,820
he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor

109
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
how his body feels, or his problems at home.

110
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.

111
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
His body disappears,

112
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,820
his identity disappears from his consciousness,

113
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,

114
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,820
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,

115
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
and at the same time to feel that he exists.

116
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,820
So existence is temporarily suspended.

117
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,820
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.

118
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel

119
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)

120
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
So what it's telling you here

121
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,820
is that obviously this automatic,

122
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,820
spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone

123
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,820
who is very well trained and who has developed technique.

124
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,820
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity

125
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,820
that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years

126
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,820
of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.

127
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long

128
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,820
to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better

129
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
than what was there before.

130
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Now, when that happens,

131
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
he says the music just flows out.

132
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,820
And because all of these people I started interviewing --

133
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,820
this was an interview which is over 30 years old --

134
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,820
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow

135
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."

136
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
And it happens in different realms.

137
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,820
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.

138
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
This is by a student of mine who interviewed

139
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.

140
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,820
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling

141
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.

142
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,820
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --

143
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave

144
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,820
as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,

145
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,820
when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.

146
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,820
But it happens in other activities.

147
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
For instance, this is another student of mine,

148
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work

149
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
with some of the leading athletes in the world.

150
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,

151
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
the same essential description of the phenomenology

152
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
of the inner state of the person.

153
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
You don't think; it goes automatically,

154
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.

155
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,

156
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs

157
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,820
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful

158
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
and very ethical, very socially responsible.

159
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
You see that these people define success

160
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
as something that helps others and at the same time

161
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
makes you feel happy as you are working at it.

162
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,

163
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,820
you can't have just one of these things be successful

164
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
if you want a meaningful and successful job.

165
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.

166
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,820
She is the founder of Body Shop,

167
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
the natural cosmetics king.

168
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
It's kind of a passion that comes

169
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,820
from doing the best and having flow while you're working.

170
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,820
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,

171
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,820
who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,

172
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
without a product -- they didn't have a product,

173
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.

174
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,820
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers

175
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
can feel the joy of technological innovation,

176
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,820
be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.

177
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
I couldn't improve on this as a good example

178
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
of how flow enters the workplace.

179
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Now, when we do studies --

180
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
we have, with other colleagues around the world,

181
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,820
done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,

182
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,820
to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --

183
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
who enjoy their work.

184
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
And regardless of the culture,

185
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,820
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions

186
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,820
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.

187
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,

188
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,820
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:

189
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;

190
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
you get immediate feedback.

191
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
You know that what you need to do

192
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
is possible to do, even though difficult,

193
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,

194
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
you feel part of something larger.

195
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
And once the conditions are present,

196
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,820
what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.

197
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,820
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.

198
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,820
And we can measure this very precisely, actually,

199
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,820
because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,

200
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,820
and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,

201
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
where you are, what you're thinking about.

202
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge

203
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,820
people experience at that moment and the amount of skill

204
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
that they feel they have at that moment.

205
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
So for each person we can establish an average,

206
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
which is the center of the diagram.

207
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,

208
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
which will be different from that of anybody else.

209
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,820
But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.

210
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
If we know what that set point is,

211
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,820
we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,

212
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,820
and it will be when your challenges are higher than average

213
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
and skills are higher than average.

214
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,820
And you may be doing things very differently from other people,

215
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,820
but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,

216
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,820
will be when you are doing what you really like to do --

217
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,820
play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,

218
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
if work is what provides flow for you.

219
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,820
And then the other areas become less and less positive.

220
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.

221
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,

222
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
but you can move into flow fairly easily

223
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
by just developing a little more skill.

224
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,820
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,

225
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,820
because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone

226
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
and to enter that -- going back to flow --

227
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
then they develop higher skills.

228
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Control is also a good place to be,

229
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,820
because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.

230
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
It's not very challenging any more.

231
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
And if you want to enter flow from control,

232
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
you have to increase the challenges.

233
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,820
So those two are ideal and complementary areas

234
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,820
from which flow is easy to go into.

235
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
The other combinations of challenge and skill

236
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,820
become progressively less optimal.

237
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.

238
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Boredom begins to be very aversive

239
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,820
and apathy becomes very negative:

240
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,820
you don't feel that you're doing anything,

241
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.

242
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.

243
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:55,820
The largest single contributor to that experience

244
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,820
is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.

245
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Even though sometimes watching television

246
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,820
about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,

247
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch

248
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
and you get feedback from it.

249
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,820
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --

250
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,820
is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.

251
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,820
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.

252
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously

253
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.

254
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,820
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.

255
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Thank you.

256
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
