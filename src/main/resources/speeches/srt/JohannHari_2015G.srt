1
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,182
One of my earliest memories

2
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:17,280
is of trying to wake up
one of my relatives and not being able to.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,255
And I was just a little kid,
so I didn't really understand why,

4
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:21,613
but as I got older,

5
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,763
I realized we had
drug addiction in my family,

6
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,638
including later cocaine addiction.

7
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:30,441
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,
partly because it's now exactly 100 years

8
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:33,511
since drugs were first banned
in the United States and Britain,

9
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,050
and we then imposed that
on the rest of the world.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,570
It's a century since we made
this really fateful decision

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,647
to take addicts and punish them
and make them suffer,

12
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:48,058
because we believed that would deter them;
it would give them an incentive to stop.

13
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,051
And a few years ago, I was looking at
some of the addicts in my life who I love,

14
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,464
and trying to figure out
if there was some way to help them.

15
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,738
And I realized there were loads
of incredibly basic questions

16
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:01,572
I just didn't know the answer to,

17
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,012
like, what really causes addiction?

18
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:07,452
Why do we carry on with this approach
that doesn't seem to be working,

19
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:10,380
and is there a better way out there
that we could try instead?

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,095
So I read loads of stuff about it,

21
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,756
and I couldn't really find
the answers I was looking for,

22
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:18,346
so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit
with different people around the world

23
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,034
who lived this and studied this

24
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:22,599
and talk to them and see
if I could learn from them.

25
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,100
And I didn't realize I would end up
going over 30,000 miles at the start,

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,008
but I ended up going and meeting
loads of different people,

27
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,787
from a transgender crack dealer
in Brownsville, Brooklyn,

28
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:35,365
to a scientist who spends a lot of time
feeding hallucinogens to mongooses

29
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:36,658
to see if they like them --

30
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:39,780
it turns out they do, but only
in very specific circumstances --

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,575
to the only country that's ever
decriminalized all drugs,

32
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,954
from cannabis to crack, Portugal.

33
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,555
And the thing I realized
that really blew my mind is,

34
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:51,363
almost everything we think
we know about addiction is wrong,

35
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:54,474
and if we start to absorb
the new evidence about addiction,

36
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:57,920
I think we're going to have to change
a lot more than our drug policies.

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,345
But let's start with what we think
we know, what I thought I knew.

38
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:03,450
Let's think about this middle row here.

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,235
Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went
off and used heroin three times a day.

40
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:10,705
Some of you look a little more
enthusiastic than others at this prospect.

41
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:11,495
(Laughter)

42
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't worry,
it's just a thought experiment.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,063
Imagine you did that, right?

44
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:16,948
What would happen?

45
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:20,765
Now, we have a story about what would
happen that we've been told for a century.

46
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,586
We think, because there are
chemical hooks in heroin,

47
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,373
as you took it for a while,

48
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:27,951
your body would become
dependent on those hooks,

49
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,739
you'd start to physically need them,

50
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,087
and at the end of those 20 days,
you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?

51
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,243
That's what I thought.

52
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:38,097
First thing that alerted me to the fact
that something's not right with this story

53
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,903
is when it was explained to me.

54
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:43,609
If I step out of this TED Talk today
and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,

55
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:46,979
I'll be taken to hospital
and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.

56
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,565
Diamorphine is heroin.

57
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:52,023
It's actually much better heroin
than you're going to buy on the streets,

58
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,879
because the stuff you buy
from a drug dealer is contaminated.

59
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,727
Actually, very little of it is heroin,

60
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,567
whereas the stuff you get
from the doctor is medically pure.

61
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,156
And you'll be given it for quite
a long period of time.

62
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,020
There are loads of people in this room,

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,130
you may not realize it,
you've taken quite a lot of heroin.

64
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,707
And anyone who is watching this
anywhere in the world, this is happening.

65
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:13,084
And if what we believe
about addiction is right --

66
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,667
those people are exposed
to all those chemical hooks --

67
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,914
What should happen?
They should become addicts.

68
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,780
This has been studied really carefully.

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,704
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed
if your grandmother had a hip replacement,

70
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,757
she didn't come out as a junkie.
(Laughter)

71
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:29,470
And when I learned this,
it seemed so weird to me,

72
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,000
so contrary to everything I'd been told,
everything I thought I knew,

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,815
I just thought it couldn't be right,
until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.

74
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,437
He's a professor
of psychology in Vancouver

75
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,376
who carried out an incredible experiment

76
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,762
I think really helps us
to understand this issue.

77
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,524
Professor Alexander explained to me,

78
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,385
the idea of addiction we've all
got in our heads, that story,

79
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,336
comes partly from a series of experiments

80
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:52,346
that were done earlier
in the 20th century.

81
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:53,976
They're really simple experiments.

82
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:57,080
You can do them tonight at home
if you feel a little bit sadistic.

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,561
You get a rat and you put it in a cage,
and you give it two water bottles:

84
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:04,229
One is just water, and the other is water
laced with either heroin or cocaine.

85
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,261
If you do that, the rat will almost always
prefer the drug water

86
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:09,323
and almost always
kill itself quite quickly.

87
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,808
So there you go, right?
That's how we think it works.

88
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:15,398
In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes
along and he looks at this experiment

89
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,800
and he noticed something.

90
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,203
He said ah, we're putting
the rat in an empty cage.

91
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,360
It's got nothing to do
except use these drugs.

92
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,094
Let's try something a bit different.

93
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,051
So Professor Alexander built a cage
that he called "Rat Park,"

94
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,691
which is basically heaven for rats.

95
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,694
They've got loads of cheese,
they've got loads of colored balls,

96
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:33,102
they've got loads of tunnels.

97
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:36,305
Crucially, they've got loads of friends.
They can have loads of sex.

98
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:41,231
And they've got both the water bottles,
the normal water and the drugged water.

99
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,940
But here's the fascinating thing:

100
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,422
In Rat Park, they don't
like the drug water.

101
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,135
They almost never use it.

102
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,712
None of them ever use it compulsively.

103
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,137
None of them ever overdose.

104
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:56,551
You go from almost 100 percent overdose
when they're isolated

105
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,801
to zero percent overdose when they
have happy and connected lives.

106
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,071
Now, when he first saw this,
Professor Alexander thought,

107
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:06,332
maybe this is just a thing about rats,
they're quite different to us.

108
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,810
Maybe not as different as we'd like,
but, you know --

109
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,970
But fortunately, there was
a human experiment

110
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,099
into the exact same principle happening
at the exact same time.

111
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,101
It was called the Vietnam War.

112
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:20,708
In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American
troops were using loads of heroin,

113
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,340
and if you look at the news
reports from the time,

114
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,022
they were really worried, because
they thought, my God, we're going to have

115
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:30,246
hundreds of thousands of junkies
on the streets of the United States

116
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,186
when the war ends; it made total sense.

117
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:35,475
Now, those soldiers who were using
loads of heroin were followed home.

118
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:38,453
The Archives of General Psychiatry
did a really detailed study,

119
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,402
and what happened to them?

120
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:43,986
It turns out they didn't go to rehab.
They didn't go into withdrawal.

121
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:47,296
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.

122
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,721
Now, if you believe the story
about chemical hooks,

123
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:53,209
that makes absolutely no sense,
but Professor Alexander began to think

124
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,540
there might be a different
story about addiction.

125
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,405
He said, what if addiction isn't
about your chemical hooks?

126
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,075
What if addiction is about your cage?

127
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:04,213
What if addiction is an adaptation
to your environment?

128
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,067
Looking at this,

129
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,189
there was another professor
called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands

130
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,760
who said, maybe we shouldn't
even call it addiction.

131
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,708
Maybe we should call it bonding.

132
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,631
Human beings have a natural
and innate need to bond,

133
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:19,209
and when we're happy and healthy,
we'll bond and connect with each other,

134
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,863
but if you can't do that,

135
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:25,687
because you're traumatized or isolated
or beaten down by life,

136
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:29,010
you will bond with something
that will give you some sense of relief.

137
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,592
Now, that might be gambling,
that might be pornography,

138
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,768
that might be cocaine,
that might be cannabis,

139
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,436
but you will bond and connect
with something because that's our nature.

140
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:40,176
That's what we want as human beings.

141
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,688
And at first, I found this quite
a difficult thing to get my head around,

142
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,143
but one way that helped me
to think about it is,

143
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:49,556
I can see, I've got over by my seat
a bottle of water, right?

144
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:53,101
I'm looking at lots of you, and lots
of you have bottles of water with you.

145
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,943
Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.

146
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:59,610
Totally legally, all of those bottles
of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

147
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,320
We could all be getting drunk --
I am right after this -- (Laughter) --

148
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,396
but we're not.

149
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:07,878
Now, because you've been able to afford
the approximately gazillion pounds

150
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:11,270
that it costs to get into a TED Talk,
I'm guessing you guys could afford

151
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,780
to be drinking vodka
for the next six months.

152
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,751
You wouldn't end up homeless.

153
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:19,376
You're not going to do that,
and the reason you're not going to do that

154
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,279
is not because anyone's stopping you.

155
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,396
It's because you've got
bonds and connections

156
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,924
that you want to be present for.

157
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,413
You've got work you love.
You've got people you love.

158
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,590
You've got healthy relationships.

159
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,260
And a core part of addiction,

160
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,745
I came to think, and I believe
the evidence suggests,

161
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,599
is about not being able to bear
to be present in your life.

162
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,962
Now, this has really
significant implications.

163
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:44,120
The most obvious implications
are for the War on Drugs.

164
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,680
In Arizona, I went out
with a group of women

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,538
who were made to wear t-shirts
saying, "I was a drug addict,"

166
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,315
and go out on chain gangs and dig graves
while members of the public jeer at them,

167
00:07:56,315 --> 00:08:00,015
and when those women get out of prison,
they're going to have criminal records

168
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:02,651
that mean they'll never work
in the legal economy again.

169
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:06,380
Now, that's a very extreme example,
obviously, in the case of the chain gang,

170
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,470
but actually almost
everywhere in the world

171
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,476
we treat addicts to some degree like that.

172
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,339
We punish them. We shame them.
We give them criminal records.

173
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,135
We put barriers between
them reconnecting.

174
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:19,138
There was a doctor in Canada,
Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,

175
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:23,033
who said to me, if you wanted to design
a system that would make addiction worse,

176
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,664
you would design that system.

177
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,544
Now, there's a place that decided
to do the exact opposite,

178
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,401
and I went there to see how it worked.

179
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:32,820
In the year 2000, Portugal had
one of the worst drug problems in Europe.

180
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,819
One percent of the population was addicted
to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,

181
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:39,611
and every year, they tried
the American way more and more.

182
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:42,586
They punished people and stigmatized them
and shamed them more,

183
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,431
and every year, the problem got worse.

184
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:48,166
And one day, the Prime Minister and
the leader of the opposition got together,

185
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,069
and basically said, look, we can't go on

186
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,622
with a country where we're having
ever more people becoming heroin addicts.

187
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,805
Let's set up a panel
of scientists and doctors

188
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:58,311
to figure out what would
genuinely solve the problem.

189
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,584
And they set up a panel led by
an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,

190
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,234
to look at all this new evidence,

191
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,820
and they came back and they said,

192
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,250
"Decriminalize all drugs
from cannabis to crack, but" --

193
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,544
and this is the crucial next step --

194
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:15,189
"take all the money we used to spend
on cutting addicts off,

195
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,610
on disconnecting them,

196
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,274
and spend it instead
on reconnecting them with society."

197
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:24,870
And that's not really what we think of
as drug treatment

198
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,752
in the United States and Britain.

199
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:28,357
So they do do residential rehab,

200
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,189
they do psychological therapy,
that does have some value.

201
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:34,596
But the biggest thing they did
was the complete opposite of what we do:

202
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:37,114
a massive program
of job creation for addicts,

203
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,734
and microloans for addicts
to set up small businesses.

204
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,399
So say you used to be a mechanic.

205
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,220
When you're ready, they'll go
to a garage, and they'll say,

206
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,131
if you employ this guy for a year,
we'll pay half his wages.

207
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,888
The goal was to make sure
that every addict in Portugal

208
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,284
had something to get out
of bed for in the morning.

209
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,488
And when I went and met the addicts
in Portugal,

210
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,766
what they said is,
as they rediscovered purpose,

211
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,895
they rediscovered bonds
and relationships with the wider society.

212
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,510
It'll be 15 years this year
since that experiment began,

213
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,206
and the results are in:

214
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:07,084
injecting drug use is down in Portugal,

215
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,703
according to the British
Journal of Criminology,

216
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,290
by 50 percent, five-zero percent.

217
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,990
Overdose is massively down,
HIV is massively down among addicts.

218
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,365
Addiction in every study
is significantly down.

219
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:22,228
One of the ways you know it's worked
so well is that almost nobody in Portugal

220
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:23,933
wants to go back to the old system.

221
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,821
Now, that's the political implications.

222
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,844
I actually think there's a layer
of implications

223
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,504
to all this research below that.

224
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,790
We live in a culture where people
feel really increasingly vulnerable

225
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,770
to all sorts of addictions,
whether it's to their smartphones

226
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,123
or to shopping or to eating.

227
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:40,459
Before these talks began --
you guys know this --

228
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,223
we were told we weren't allowed
to have our smartphones on,

229
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,868
and I have to say, a lot of you
looked an awful lot like

230
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:48,777
addicts who were told their dealer
was going to be unavailable

231
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:50,706
for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)

232
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,577
A lot of us feel like that,
and it might sound weird to say,

233
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:56,994
I've been talking about how disconnection
is a major driver of addiction

234
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,429
and weird to say it's growing,

235
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,014
because you think we're the most connected
society that's ever been, surely.

236
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:05,100
But I increasingly began to think
that the connections we have

237
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,122
or think we have, are like a kind
of parody of human connection.

238
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,085
If you have a crisis in your life,
you'll notice something.

239
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:14,019
It won't be your Twitter followers
who come to sit with you.

240
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,888
It won't be your Facebook friends
who help you turn it round.

241
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:20,033
It'll be your flesh and blood friends
who you have deep and nuanced

242
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,434
and textured, face-to-face
relationships with,

243
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:26,993
and there's a study I learned about from
Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,

244
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:29,200
that I think tells us a lot about this.

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,598
He looked at the number of close friends
the average American believes

246
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:34,549
they can call on in a crisis.

247
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:37,567
That number has been declining
steadily since the 1950s.

248
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,441
The amount of floor space
an individual has in their home

249
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,508
has been steadily increasing,

250
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,412
and I think that's like a metaphor

251
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,269
for the choice we've made as a culture.

252
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,169
We've traded floorspace for friends,
we've traded stuff for connections,

253
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,790
and the result is we are one of the
loneliest societies there has ever been.

254
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,981
And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did
the Rat Park experiment, says,

255
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:01,552
we talk all the time in addiction
about individual recovery,

256
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,479
and it's right to talk about that,

257
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,034
but we need to talk much more
about social recovery.

258
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:09,687
Something's gone wrong with us,
not just with individuals but as a group,

259
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,120
and we've created a society where,
for a lot of us,

260
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,605
life looks a whole lot more
like that isolated cage

261
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,676
and a whole lot less like Rat Park.

262
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,732
If I'm honest, this isn't
why I went into it.

263
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:23,062
I didn't go in to the discover
the political stuff, the social stuff.

264
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,425
I wanted to know how to help
the people I love.

265
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,657
And when I came back from this
long journey and I'd learned all this,

266
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:31,420
I looked at the addicts in my life,

267
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,950
and if you're really candid,
it's hard loving an addict,

268
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,804
and there's going to be lots of people
who know in this room.

269
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:41,080
You are angry a lot of the time,

270
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,105
and I think one of the reasons
why this debate is so charged

271
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:47,929
is because it runs through the heart
of each of us, right?

272
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,900
Everyone has a bit of them
that looks at an addict and thinks,

273
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,575
I wish someone would just stop you.

274
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:56,359
And the kind of scripts we're told for how
to deal with the addicts in our lives

275
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,467
is typified, I think,

276
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,516
the reality show "Intervention,"
if you guys have ever seen it.

277
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:03,224
I think everything in our lives
is defined by reality TV,

278
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,801
but that's another TED Talk.

279
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,013
If you've ever seen
the show "Intervention,"

280
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,493
it's a pretty simple premise.

281
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:11,610
Get an addict, all the people
in their life, gather them together,

282
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,269
confront them with what they're doing,
and they say, if you don't shape up,

283
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,631
we're going to cut you off.

284
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:19,350
So what they do is they take
the connection to the addict,

285
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,460
and they threaten it,
they make it contingent

286
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,892
on the addict behaving the way they want.

287
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:27,643
And I began to think, I began to see
why that approach doesn't work,

288
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:32,217
and I began to think that's almost like
the importing of the logic of the Drug War

289
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,098
into our private lives.

290
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:37,790
So I was thinking,
how could I be Portuguese?

291
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,319
And what I've tried to do now,
and I can't tell you I do it consistently

292
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,292
and I can't tell you it's easy,

293
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,800
is to say to the addicts in my life

294
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,050
that I want to deepen
the connection with them,

295
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,744
to say to them, I love you
whether you're using or you're not.

296
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,600
I love you, whatever state you're in,

297
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,015
and if you need me,
I'll come and sit with you

298
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:59,639
because I love you and I don't
want you to be alone

299
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,659
or to feel alone.

300
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,725
And I think the core of that message --

301
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:06,418
you're not alone, we love you --

302
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:09,507
has to be at every level
of how we respond to addicts,

303
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:12,154
socially, politically and individually.

304
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:16,426
For 100 years now, we've been singing
war songs about addicts.

305
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:20,350
I think all along we should have been
singing love songs to them,

306
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,622
because the opposite of addiction
is not sobriety.

307
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:28,477
The opposite of addiction is connection.

308
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:30,450
Thank you.

309
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:38,920
(Applause)
