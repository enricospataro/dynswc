1
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
Today, I'm going to take you

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
around the world in 18 minutes.

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
My base of operations is in the U.S.,

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
but let's start at the other end of the map,

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
in Kyoto, Japan,

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
where I was living with a Japanese family

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
while I was doing part of my dissertational research

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
15 years ago.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
I knew even then that I would encounter

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
cultural differences and misunderstandings,

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
but they popped up when I least expected it.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
On my first day,

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
I went to a restaurant,

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
After a pause, the waiter said,

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
"One does not put sugar in green tea."

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
But I really like my tea sweet."

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
of the same explanation.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
"One does not put sugar

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
in green tea."

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
"I understand," I said,

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
but I'd like to put some sugar

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
in my green tea."

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
(Laughter)

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Surprised by my insistence,

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
the waiter took up the issue with the manager.

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Pretty soon,

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
a lengthy discussion ensued,

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and finally the manager came over to me and said,

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
(Laughter)

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
I ordered a cup of coffee,

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
which the waiter brought over promptly.

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Resting on the saucer

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
were two packets of sugar.

40
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
My failure to procure myself

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
a cup of sweet, green tea

42
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
was not due to a simple misunderstanding.

43
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
This was due to a fundamental difference

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
in our ideas about choice.

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
From my American perspective,

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
when a paying customer makes a reasonable request

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
based on her preferences,

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
she has every right to have that request met.

49
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
The American way, to quote Burger King,

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
is to "have it your way,"

51
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
because, as Starbucks says,

52
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
"happiness is in your choices."

53
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
(Laughter)

54
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
But from the Japanese perspective,

55
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --

56
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
(Laughter)

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
from making the wrong choice.

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
and they were doing their best to help me save face.

62
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Americans tend to believe

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
in the way they practice choice.

65
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
best fulfills an innate and universal

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
desire for choice in all humans.

68
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Unfortunately,

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
these beliefs are based on assumptions

70
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
that don't always hold true

71
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
in many countries, in many cultures.

72
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
At times they don't even hold true

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
at America's own borders.

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

75
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
and the problems associated with them.

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
about some of your own assumptions

78
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
First assumption:

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
if a choice affects you,

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
then you should be the one to make it.

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
This is the only way to ensure

83
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
that your preferences and interests

84
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
will be most fully accounted for.

85
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
It is essential for success.

86
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
In America, the primary locus of choice

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
is the individual.

88
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
regardless of what other people want or recommend.

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
It's called "being true to yourself."

91
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
But do all individuals benefit

92
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
from taking such an approach to choice?

93
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies

94
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
in which we sought the answer to this very question.

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
In one study,

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,

97
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children

98
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
into the laboratory,

99
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
and we divided them up into three groups.

100
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
The first group came in,

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
and they even got to choose which marker

105
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
they would write their answers with.

106
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
When the second group of children came in,

107
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
but this time Miss Smith told them

109
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
which anagrams to do

110
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
and which markers to write their answers with.

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
Now when the third group came in,

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
they were told that their anagrams and their markers

113
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
had been chosen by their mothers.

114
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
(Laughter)

115
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
In reality,

116
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
the kids who were told what to do,

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,

118
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
were actually given the very same activity,

119
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
which their counterparts in the first group

120
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
had freely chosen.

121
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
With this procedure, we were able to ensure

122
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
that the kids across the three groups

123
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
all did the same activity,

124
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
making it easier for us to compare performance.

125
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity

126
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
yielded striking differences

127
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
in how well they performed.

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Anglo-Americans,

129
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
they did two and a half times more anagrams

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
when they got to choose them,

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
as compared to when it was

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.

133
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
It didn't matter who did the choosing,

134
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
if the task was dictated by another,

135
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
their performance suffered.

136
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed

137
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.

138
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
(Laughter)

139
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
One girl named Mary said,

140
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
"You asked my mother?"

141
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
(Laughter)

142
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
In contrast,

143
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Asian-American children

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
performed best when they believed

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
their mothers had made the choice,

146
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
second best when they chose for themselves,

147
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.

148
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
A girl named Natsumi

149
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room

150
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
and tugged on her skirt and asked,

151
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
"Could you please tell my mommy

152
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
I did it just like she said?"

153
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
The first-generation children were strongly influenced

154
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
by their immigrant parents'

155
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
approach to choice.

156
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
For them, choice was not just a way

157
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
of defining and asserting

158
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
their individuality,

159
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
but a way to create community and harmony

160
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
by deferring to the choices

161
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
of people whom they trusted and respected.

162
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,

163
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
then that self, most likely,

164
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
[was] composed, not of an individual,

165
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
but of a collective.

166
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures

167
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
as it was about satisfying

168
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
one's own preferences.

169
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Or, you could say that

170
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
the individual's preferences were shaped

171
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
by the preferences of specific others.

172
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
The assumption then that we do best

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
when the individual self chooses

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
only holds

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
when that self

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
is clearly divided from others.

177
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
When, in contrast,

178
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
two or more individuals

179
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
see their choices and their outcomes

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
as intimately connected,

181
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
then they may amplify one another's success

182
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
by turning choosing

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
into a collective act.

184
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
To insist that they choose independently

185
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
might actually compromise

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
both their performance

187
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
and their relationships.

188
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Yet that is exactly what

189
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
the American paradigm demands.

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
It leaves little room for interdependence

191
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.

192
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
It requires that everyone treat choice

193
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
as a private and self-defining act.

194
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
People that have grown up in such a paradigm

195
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
might find it motivating,

196
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
but it is a mistake to assume

197
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
that everyone thrives under the pressure

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
of choosing alone.

199
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice

200
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
goes something like this.

201
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
The more choices you have,

202
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
the more likely you are

203
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
to make the best choice.

204
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,

205
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
and Amazon, with 27 million books

206
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
and Match.com with -- what is it? --

207
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
15 million date possibilities now.

208
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
You will surely find the perfect match.

209
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Let's test this assumption

210
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
by heading over to Eastern Europe.

211
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Here, I interviewed people

212
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
who were residents of formerly communist countries,

213
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
who had all faced the challenge

214
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
of transitioning to a more

215
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
democratic and capitalistic society.

216
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
One of the most interesting revelations

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
came not from an answer to a question,

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.

219
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
When the participants arrived for their interview,

220
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I offered them a set of drinks:

221
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --

222
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
seven, to be exact.

223
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
During the very first session,

224
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
which was run in Russia,

225
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
one of the participants made a comment

226
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
that really caught me off guard.

227
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.

228
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."

229
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
(Murmuring)

230
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
I was so struck by this comment that from then on,

231
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
I started to offer all the participants

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
those seven sodas,

233
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"

234
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Again and again,

235
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
they perceived these seven different sodas,

236
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
not as seven choices, but as one choice:

237
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
soda or no soda.

238
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
When I put out juice and water

239
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
in addition to these seven sodas,

240
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
now they perceived it as only three choices --

241
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
juice, water and soda.

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,

243
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
not just to a particular flavor of soda,

244
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
but to a particular brand.

245
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
You know, research shows repeatedly

246
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
that we can't actually tell the difference

247
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
between Coke and Pepsi.

248
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Of course, you and I know

249
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
that Coke is the better choice.

250
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,820
(Laughter)

251
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
For modern Americans who are exposed

252
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
to more options and more ads associated with options

253
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
than anyone else in the world,

254
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
choice is just as much about who they are

255
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
as it is about what the product is.

256
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,

257
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters

258
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
and so every choice matters.

259
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
But for Eastern Europeans,

260
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
the sudden availability of all these

261
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.

262
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
They were flooded with choice

263
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.

264
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
When asked, "What words and images

265
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
do you associate with choice?"

266
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Grzegorz from Warsaw said,

267
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
"Ah, for me it is fear.

268
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
There are some dilemmas you see.

269
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I am used to no choice."

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Bohdan from Kiev said,

271
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
in response to how he felt about

272
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
the new consumer marketplace,

273
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
"It is too much.

274
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
We do not need everything that is there."

275
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
A sociologist from

276
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,

277
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
"The older generation jumped from nothing

278
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
to choice all around them.

279
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
They were never given a chance to learn

280
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
how to react."

281
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,

282
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.

283
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
I don't mean to say that I want no choice,

284
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
but many of these choices are quite artificial."

285
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
In reality, many choices are between things

286
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
that are not that much different.

287
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
The value of choice

288
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
depends on our ability

289
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
to perceive differences

290
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
between the options.

291
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Americans train their whole lives

292
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
to play "spot the difference."

293
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
They practice this from such an early age

294
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
that they've come to believe that everyone

295
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
must be born with this ability.

296
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
In fact, though all humans share

297
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
a basic need and desire for choice,

298
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
we don't all see choice in the same places

299
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
or to the same extent.

300
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
When someone can't see how one choice

301
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
is unlike another,

302
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,

303
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
the process of choosing can be

304
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
confusing and frustrating.

305
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Instead of making better choices,

306
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
we become overwhelmed by choice,

307
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
sometimes even afraid of it.

308
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Choice no longer offers opportunities,

309
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
but imposes constraints.

310
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
It's not a marker of liberation,

311
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
but of suffocation

312
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
by meaningless minutiae.

313
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
In other words,

314
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
choice can develop into the very opposite

315
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
of everything it represents

316
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
in America

317
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
when it is thrust upon those

318
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
who are insufficiently prepared for it.

319
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
But it is not only other people

320
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
in other places

321
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
that are feeling the pressure

322
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
of ever-increasing choice.

323
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Americans themselves are discovering

324
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
that unlimited choice

325
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
seems more attractive in theory

326
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
than in practice.

327
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
We all have physical, mental

328
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
and emotional (Laughter) limitations

329
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
that make it impossible for us

330
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
to process every single choice we encounter,

331
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
even in the grocery store,

332
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
let alone over the course of our entire lives.

333
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
A number of my studies have shown

334
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
that when you give people 10 or more options

335
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,

336
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
whether it be health care, investment,

337
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
other critical areas.

338
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Yet still, many of us believe

339
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
that we should make all our own choices

340
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
and seek out even more of them.

341
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
This brings me to the third,

342
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
and perhaps most problematic, assumption:

343
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
"You must never

344
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
say no to choice."

345
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.

346
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
and then hop across the pond to France.

347
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Right outside Chicago,

348
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,

349
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
were about to have their first baby.

350
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
They'd already picked out a name for her,

351
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Barbara, after her grandmother.

352
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,

353
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
she started to experience contractions

354
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and was rushed to the emergency room.

355
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
The baby was delivered through a C-section,

356
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,

357
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
a loss of oxygen to the brain.

358
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Unable to breathe on her own,

359
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
she was put on a ventilator.

360
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Two days later,

361
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
the doctors gave the Mitchells

362
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
a choice:

363
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
They could either remove Barbara

364
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
off the life support,

365
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
in which case she would die within a matter of hours,

366
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
or they could keep her on life support,

367
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
in which case she might still die

368
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
within a matter of days.

369
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
If she survived, she would remain

370
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
in a permanent vegetative state,

371
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
never able to walk, talk

372
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
or interact with others.

373
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
What do they do?

374
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
What do any parent do?

375
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
In a study I conducted

376
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,

377
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
American and French parents

378
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
were interviewed.

379
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
They had all suffered

380
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
the same tragedy.

381
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
In all cases, the life support was removed,

382
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
and the infants had died.

383
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
But there was a big difference.

384
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
In France, the doctors decided whether and when

385
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
the life support would be removed,

386
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
while in the United States,

387
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
the final decision rested with the parents.

388
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
We wondered:

389
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
does this have an effect on how the parents

390
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
cope with the loss of their loved one?

391
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
We found that it did.

392
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Even up to a year later,

393
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
American parents

394
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
were more likely to express negative emotions,

395
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
as compared to their French counterparts.

396
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
French parents were more likely to say things like,

397
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
"Noah was here for so little time,

398
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
but he taught us so much.

399
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
He gave us a new perspective on life."

400
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
American parents were more likely to say things like,

401
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
"What if? What if?"

402
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Another parent complained,

403
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.

404
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
How did they get me to do that?"

405
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
And another parent said,

406
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
"I feel as if I've played a role

407
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
in an execution."

408
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
But when the American parents were asked

409
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
if they would rather have had

410
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
the doctors make the decision,

411
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
they all said, "No."

412
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
They could not imagine

413
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
turning that choice over to another,

414
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
even though having made that choice

415
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
made them feel trapped,

416
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
guilty, angry.

417
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
In a number of cases

418
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
they were even clinically depressed.

419
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
These parents could not contemplate

420
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
giving up the choice,

421
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
because to do so would have gone contrary

422
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
to everything they had been taught

423
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
and everything they had come to believe

424
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
about the power

425
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
and purpose of choice.

426
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
In her essay, "The White Album,"

427
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Joan Didion writes,

428
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
"We tell ourselves stories

429
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
in order to live.

430
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
We interpret what we see,

431
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
select the most workable

432
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
of the multiple choices.

433
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
We live entirely by the imposition

434
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
of a narrative line

435
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
upon disparate images,

436
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
by the idea with which we have learned to freeze

437
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
the shifting phantasmagoria,

438
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,820
which is our actual experience."

439
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
The story Americans tell,

440
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
the story upon which

441
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
the American dream depends,

442
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
is the story of limitless choice.

443
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
This narrative

444
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
promises so much:

445
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
freedom, happiness,

446
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
success.

447
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
It lays the world at your feet and says,

448
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
"You can have anything, everything."

449
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
It's a great story,

450
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
and it's understandable why they would be reluctant

451
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
to revise it.

452
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
But when you take a close look,

453
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
you start to see the holes,

454
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
and you start to see that the story

455
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
can be told in many other ways.

456
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Americans have so often tried to

457
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
disseminate their ideas of choice,

458
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
believing that they will be, or ought to be,

459
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
welcomed with open hearts and minds.

460
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
But the history books and the daily news tell us

461
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
it doesn't always work out that way.

462
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
The phantasmagoria,

463
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
the actual experience that we try to understand

464
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
and organize through narrative,

465
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
varies from place to place.

466
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
No single narrative serves the needs

467
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
of everyone everywhere.

468
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Moreover, Americans themselves

469
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
could benefit from incorporating

470
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
new perspectives into their own narrative,

471
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
which has been driving their choices

472
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
for so long.

473
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Robert Frost once said that,

474
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
"It is poetry that is lost in translation."

475
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
This suggests that

476
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
whatever is beautiful and moving,

477
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
whatever gives us a new way to see,

478
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
cannot be communicated to those

479
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,820
who speak a different language.

480
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
But Joseph Brodsky said that,

481
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
"It is poetry

482
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
that is gained in translation,"

483
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
suggesting that translation

484
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
can be a creative,

485
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
transformative act.

486
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
When it comes to choice,

487
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
we have far more to gain than to lose

488
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
by engaging in the many

489
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
translations of the narratives.

490
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Instead of replacing

491
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
one story with another,

492
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
we can learn from and revel in

493
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
the many versions that exist

494
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
and the many that have yet to be written.

495
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,820
No matter where we're from

496
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
and what your narrative is,

497
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
we all have a responsibility

498
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
to open ourselves up to a wider array

499
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
of what choice can do,

500
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
and what it can represent.

501
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
And this does not lead to

502
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,820
a paralyzing moral relativism.

503
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Rather, it teaches us when

504
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
and how to act.

505
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,820
It brings us that much closer

506
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,820
to realizing the full potential of choice,

507
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
to inspiring the hope

508
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
and achieving the freedom

509
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
that choice promises

510
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
but doesn't always deliver.

511
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
If we learn to speak to one another,

512
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
albeit through translation,

513
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
then we can begin to see choice

514
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
in all its strangeness,

515
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,820
complexity

516
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
and compelling beauty.

517
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Thank you.

518
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:16,820
(Applause)

519
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

520
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography

521
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
that we have not written in the program book.

522
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,820
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.

523
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:

524
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
How does that influence your study of choosing

525
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
because that's an activity

526
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
that for most people is associated with visual inputs

527
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,820
like aesthetics and color and so on?

528
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that

529
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
because one of the things that's interesting about being blind

530
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
is you actually get a different vantage point

531
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
when you observe the way

532
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
sighted people make choices.

533
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,820
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there

534
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
that are very visual these days.

535
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Yeah, I -- as you would expect --

536
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,820
get pretty frustrated by choices

537
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,820
like what nail polish to put on

538
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
because I have to rely on what other people suggest.

539
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
And I can't decide.

540
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
And so one time I was in a beauty salon,

541
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,820
and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.

542
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."

543
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
And the other one was called "Adorable."

544
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
(Laughter)

545
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
And so I asked these two ladies,

546
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"

547
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
"Well, what does it look like?"

548
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."

549
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
"Okay, great."

550
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."

551
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
"What does it look like?"

552
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,820
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."

553
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?

554
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
What's different about them?"

555
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."

556
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Okay, we got that.

557
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
And the only thing they had consensus on:

558
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
well, if I could see them, I would

559
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
clearly be able to tell them apart.

560
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
(Laughter)

561
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,820
And what I wondered was whether they were being affected

562
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
by the name or the content of the color,

563
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820
so I decided to do a little experiment.

564
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,820
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,

565
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,820
and I stripped the labels off.

566
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
And I brought women into the laboratory,

567
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"

568
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,820
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,

569
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
of putting the same color nail polish

570
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
in both those bottles.

571
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
(Laughter)

572
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,820
(Applause)

573
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,820
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.

574
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,820
Now, of the women that could tell them apart,

575
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"

576
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
and when the labels were on,

577
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,820
they picked "Ballet Slippers."

578
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
So as far as I can tell,

579
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
a rose by any other name

580
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
probably does look different

581
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,820
and maybe even smells different.

582
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,820
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.

583
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:57,820
(Applause)
