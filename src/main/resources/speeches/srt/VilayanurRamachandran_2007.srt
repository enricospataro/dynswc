1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
the functions and structure of the human brain.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,820
Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
you can hold in the palm of your hand,

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,820
and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,820
I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,820
and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
that we call human nature and human consciousness.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,820
How does this happen?

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
One approach, the one we use mainly,

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
in all your mental capacities,

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function,

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
with other functions being preserved intact,

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
and this gives you some confidence in asserting

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,820
that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
So you can then map function onto structure,

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
and then find out what the circuitry's doing

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
to generate that particular function.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
So that's what we're trying to do.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
So let me give you a few striking examples of this.

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,820
In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.

35
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,820
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
If you look at the first slide there,

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,820
that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
the lobes that constitute the brain.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
you can't see it there --

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
And that's been called the face area in the brain,

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.

44
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
You can still recognize them from their voice

45
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,"

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.

48
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
and you know it's a mirror,

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,820
OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.

52
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.

54
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
This is called the Capgras delusion,

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
has had a head injury, comes out of coma,

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
but she's an impostor.

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
She's some other woman pretending to be my mother."

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Now, why does this happen?

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
in all other respects, but when he sees his mother,

64
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Now, the most common interpretation of this,

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,

67
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
and the same argument applies to women, by the way,

69
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
but I'll just talk about guys.

70
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
When you're a little baby, a young baby,

71
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.

72
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
I'm not saying I believe this,

74
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
but this is the standard Freudian view.

75
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,

76
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.

77
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
And then what happens is,

79
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,

80
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,820
allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,

81
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.

83
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
And you say, "My God, if this is my mom,

84
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
how come I'm being sexually turned on?

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
She's some other woman. She's an impostor."

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.

87
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,820
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --

89
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
(Laughter)

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,820
-- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.

92
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
(Laughter)

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,820
He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,

94
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
but it's some other dog." Right?

95
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
(Laughter)

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,

98
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.

99
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Now, what's really going on?

100
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
So, to explain this curious disorder,

101
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,820
we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.

102
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,

103
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
go to the visual areas in the brain.

104
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,

105
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,820
called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.

107
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.

108
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
You can call it the face area of the brain, right?

109
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
I talked about that earlier.

110
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?

111
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
But from that area, the message cascades

112
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,

113
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
the emotional core of the brain,

114
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
and that structure, called the amygdala,

115
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.

116
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?

117
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,

118
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
or a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --

119
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
or a shoe, or something like that? OK?

120
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Which you can completely ignore.

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.

123
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Your heart starts beating faster.

124
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to

125
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
create from muscular exertion.

126
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,820
And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm

127
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,820
and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.

128
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
So I can determine, when you're looking at something,

129
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,820
whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?

130
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
And I'll get to that in a minute.

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,820
So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his --

132
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,820
any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,

133
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,

134
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,

135
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
or your mother, for that matter, OK?

136
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
And then the message cascades into the amygdala,

137
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,820
But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,

139
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.

140
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
So because the fusiform is intact,

141
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
the chap can still recognize his mother,

142
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
and says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."

143
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,

144
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,820
he says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Or terror, as the case may be? Right?

146
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
(Laughter)

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,820
And therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?

148
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
This can't be my mother.

149
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."

150
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
How do you test this?

151
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
and measure your galvanic skin response,

153
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
and show pictures on the screen,

154
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
I can measure how you sweat when you see an object,

155
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.

156
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,820
If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?

157
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --

158
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.

159
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
You don't even have to be Jewish.

160
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
(Laughter)

161
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Now, what happens if you show this patient?

162
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,820
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen

163
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
and measure his galvanic skin response.

164
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,

165
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
but when you show him a picture of his mother,

166
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
the galvanic skin response is flat.

167
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
There's no emotional reaction to his mother,

168
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,820
because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.

169
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,

170
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --

171
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
but the wire from vision to emotions is cut

172
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:

174
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,820
take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome

175
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,

176
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,820
that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation

177
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.

178
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
By the way, if this patient then goes,

179
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,820
and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --

180
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"

181
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
There's no delusion through the phone.

182
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?

183
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
You look just like my mother." OK?

184
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
The reason is there's a separate pathway

185
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,

186
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
and that's not been cut by the accident.

187
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.

188
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.

189
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,820
OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?

190
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?

191
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
And we approach this problem

192
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,820
by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.

193
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
And you all know what a phantom limb is.

194
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,

195
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
or you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,

196
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
it's now a serious problem --

197
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,820
you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,

198
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.

199
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.

200
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,820
I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --

202
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,820
who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps

203
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
at the appropriate time of the month.

204
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And in fact, one student asked me the other day,

205
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
"Do they get phantom PMS?"

206
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
(Laughter)

207
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.

208
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
OK, now the next question is,

209
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?

210
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
One of the things we've found was,

211
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
about half the patients with phantom limbs

212
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
claim that they can move the phantom.

213
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder,

214
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.

215
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.

216
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
The patient's not delusional.

217
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
He knows that the arm is not there,

218
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.

219
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.

220
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,820
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.

221
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.

222
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."

223
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?

224
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
It sounds like an oxymoron.

225
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,

226
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,

227
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,820
the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.

228
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,

229
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,

231
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,820
in a sling for a few months or a year, and then,

232
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,

233
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
the surgeon amputates the arm,

234
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?

235
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
And this is a serious clinical problem.

236
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Patients become depressed.

237
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?

238
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
So, how do you treat this syndrome?

239
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?

240
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,

241
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,

242
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
and the actual arm had been paralyzed,

243
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,

244
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,820
and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.

245
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Why does this happen?

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
When the arm was intact, but paralyzed,

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"

248
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
but it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."

249
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.

250
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,

251
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
and we call this learned paralysis, OK?

252
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,820
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,

253
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
that the mere command to move the arm

254
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.

255
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
And then, when you've amputated the arm,

256
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,820
this learned paralysis carries over into your body image

257
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
and into your phantom, OK?

258
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Now, how do you help these patients?

259
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis,

260
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,820
so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm

261
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
of the phantom arm?

262
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,

263
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?

264
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.

265
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.

266
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
But that costs millions of dollars.

267
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,

268
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
but don't tell my funding agencies.

269
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
(Laughter)

270
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.

271
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,

272
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.

273
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.

274
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut

275
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.

276
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.

277
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.

278
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,

279
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
which I call a mirror box, right?

280
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
And the patient puts his phantom left arm,

281
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,

283
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
and makes the same posture, the clenched posture,

284
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?

285
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
He looks at the phantom being resurrected,

286
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,820
because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,

287
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.

288
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom --

289
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,820
your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."

290
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?

291
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,

292
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,

293
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."

294
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And remember, my first patient who came in --

295
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
(Applause)

296
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
-- thank you. (Applause)

297
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,

298
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."

299
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."

300
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.

301
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
He knows it's a mirror reflection,

302
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
but it's a vivid sensory experience.

303
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Now, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."

304
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."

305
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I said, "Move your normal hand."

306
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!

307
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
And my pain is being relieved." OK?

308
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
And then I said, "Close your eyes."

309
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
He closes his eyes.

310
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
"And move your normal hand."

311
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
"OK, open your eyes."

313
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"

314
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
So, he was like a kid in a candy store.

315
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,820
So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis

316
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
and the critical role of visual input,

317
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize

318
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.

319
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
(Laughter)

320
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
(Applause)

321
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.

322
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
(Laughter)

323
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis

324
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,820
that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --

325
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
there may be a learned component to this,

326
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.

327
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
So, I said, "Look, Derek" --

328
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --

329
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.

330
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Maybe, after a period of practice,

331
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,

332
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
and start moving your paralyzed arm,

333
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
and then, relieve yourself of pain."

334
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
So he said OK, and he took it home.

335
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."

336
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,

337
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."

338
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I said, "What?"

339
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
He said, "It's gone."

340
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I said, "What's gone?"

341
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.

342
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
(Laughter)

343
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?

344
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
It's disappeared."

345
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,

346
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I mean I've changed this guy's body image,

347
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?

348
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
And I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"

349
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
He said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm

350
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,

351
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.

352
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,

353
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
and your box doesn't reach."

354
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
(Laughter)

355
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,

356
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"

357
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
He thought I was some kind of magician.

358
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Now, why does this happen?

359
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.

360
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,820
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.

361
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
On the other hand, there's no proprioception,

362
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,820
muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?

363
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
And your motor command saying there is an arm,

364
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,

365
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?

366
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.

367
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears

368
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.

369
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
So, that's the bonus.

370
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients

371
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
by other groups in Helsinki,

372
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,

373
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.

374
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,

375
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
nothing you can do about it.

376
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,820
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,

377
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.

378
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
This has also gone through clinical trials,

379
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
helping lots and lots of patients.

380
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,820
OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,

381
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,820
which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.

382
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.

383
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.

384
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
He pointed out that certain people in the population,

385
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:

386
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
every time they see a number, it's colored.

387
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,

388
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
nine is indigo, OK?

389
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.

390
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.

391
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
C sharp is blue, F sharp is green,

392
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
another tone might be yellow, right?

393
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Why does this happen?

394
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,

395
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
a mingling of the senses.

396
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
In us, all the senses are distinct.

397
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
These people muddle up their senses.

398
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Why does this happen?

399
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.

400
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Synesthesia runs in families,

401
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.

402
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point

403
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --

404
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,820
synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists

405
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
and other creative people than in the general population.

406
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Why would that be?

407
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
I'm going to answer that question.

408
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
It's never been answered before.

409
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?

410
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Well, there are many theories.

411
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
One theory is they're just crazy.

412
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.

413
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?

414
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Now, there may be some truth to this,

415
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.

416
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
(Laughter)

417
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
OK. Now, the third theory is that --

418
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,820
well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?

419
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
So, we found that the color area and the number area

420
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.

421
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring

422
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
between color and numbers in the brain.

423
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,

424
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
and that's why you get synesthesia.

425
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Now remember -- why does this happen?

426
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Why would there be crossed wires in some people?

427
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Remember I said it runs in families?

428
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
That gives you the clue.

429
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
And that is, there is an abnormal gene,

430
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.

431
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
In all of us, it turns out

432
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,820
we are born with everything wired to everything else.

433
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,820
So, every brain region is wired to every other region,

434
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
and these are trimmed down to create

435
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.

436
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
So, if there's a gene causing this trimming

437
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
and if that gene mutates,

438
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.

439
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,820
And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.

440
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.

441
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
So far, so good.

442
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,

443
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
so everything is cross-connected?

444
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,

445
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,

446
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
linking seemingly unrelated ideas,

447
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,820
such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."

448
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,

449
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?

450
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?

451
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Normal people say, she's warm like the sun,

452
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.

453
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Instantly, you've found the links.

454
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring

455
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
and concepts are also in different parts of the brain,

456
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
then it's going to create a greater propensity

457
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,820
towards metaphorical thinking and creativity

458
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
in people with synesthesia.

459
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,820
And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia

460
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
among poets, artists and novelists.

461
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.

462
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?

463
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
(Applause)

464
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,820
OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.

465
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,820
Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,

466
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,820
A is A, B is B, C is C.

467
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Different shapes for different phonemes, right?

468
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Here, you've got Martian alphabet.

469
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba.

470
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba?

471
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,820
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba? Raise your hands.

472
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
Well, it's one or two mutants.

473
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
(Laughter)

474
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
How many of you think that's Buba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.

475
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Ninety-nine percent of you.

476
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?

477
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,820
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,

478
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,820
meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,

479
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,820
in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,

480
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,820
mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.

481
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you

482
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
is your brain is engaging in a primitive --

483
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,

484
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,820
but these photons in your eye are doing this shape,

485
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,

486
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,820
but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.

487
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
It's a primitive form of abstraction,

488
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,820
and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,

489
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
because when that's damaged,

490
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,820
these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki,

491
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.

492
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,820
If you ask this guy, what -- "all that glitters is not gold,"

493
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
what does that mean?"

494
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.

495
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,820
You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"

496
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,820
So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.

497
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,820
So, this area is about eight times the size in higher --

498
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,820
especially in humans -- as in lower primates.

499
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,

500
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,820
because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,

501
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,820
and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.

502
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,820
And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities

503
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,820
like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.

504
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,820
All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,

505
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,820
we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,

506
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
and by studying patients and asking the right questions.

507
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Thank you.

508
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
