1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I spend most of my time

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
in jails, in prisons, on death row.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
And being here at TED

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
has been very, very energizing to me.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
is that TED has an identity.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
And you can actually say things here

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
that have impacts around the world.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
And sometimes when it comes through TED,

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
it has meaning and power

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
that it doesn't have when it doesn't.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
And we've had some fantastic presentations.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And I think what we've learned

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
but if you're a compassionate teacher,

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
they can be especially meaningful.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
If you're a doctor you can do some good things,

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And I didn't learn about this actually

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
practicing law and doing the work that I do.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
I grew up in a house

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
that was the traditional African-American home

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
that was dominated by a matriarch,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
and that matriarch was my grandmother.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
She was tough, she was strong,

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
she was powerful.

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,820
She was the end of every argument in our family.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
She was born in the 1880's

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
and the experience of slavery

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
very much shaped the way she saw the world.

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
When I would see her as a little boy,

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
and then she'd let me go.

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
And she just had this quality

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
that you always wanted to be near her.

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.

53
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
it would be difficult to get her time and attention.

56
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
My cousins would be running around everywhere.

57
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,

58
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
waking up one morning, going into the living room,

59
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and all of my cousins were running around.

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
And my grandmother was sitting across the room

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
staring at me.

62
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And at first I thought we were playing a game.

63
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
And I would look at her and I'd smile,

64
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
but she was very serious.

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
she got up and she came across the room

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
and she took me by the hand

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."

69
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.

70
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
I never will forget it.

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
I said, "Okay, Mama."

74
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."

75
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Then she sat me down and she looked at me

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
and she said, "I want you to know

77
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I've been watching you."

78
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
And she said, "I think you're special."

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,820
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I will never forget it.

81
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
I said, "Okay, Mama."

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
is that you'll always love your mom."

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
She said, "That's my baby girl,

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
is that you'll always do the right thing

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
even when the right thing is the hard thing."

91
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me

93
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
is that you'll never drink alcohol."

94
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
(Laughter)

95
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
I grew up in the country in the rural South,

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.

98
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
When I was about 14 or 15,

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I don't know where he got it --

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
and they offered it to me.

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."

108
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."

109
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
And then my brother started staring at me.

110
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Then he looked at me real hard and he said,

112
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
on that conversation Mama had with you."

114
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
(Laughter)

115
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"

116
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."

117
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
(Laughter)

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I was devastated.

119
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
(Laughter)

120
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And I'm going to admit something to you.

121
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.

122
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
I know this might be broadcast broadly.

123
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
But I'm 52 years old,

124
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
and I'm going to admit to you

125
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
that I've never had a drop of alcohol.

126
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
(Applause)

127
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;

128
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,820
I say that because there is power in identity.

129
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
When we create the right kind of identity,

130
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
we can say things to the world around us

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
that they don't actually believe makes sense.

132
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
We can get them to do things

133
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
that they don't think they can do.

134
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
When I thought about my grandmother,

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
of course she would think all her grandkids were special.

136
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Well I've been trying to say something

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
about our criminal justice system.

141
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
This country is very different today

142
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
than it was 40 years ago.

143
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.

144
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Today, there are 2.3 million.

145
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration

146
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
in the world.

147
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
We have seven million people on probation and parole.

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,

149
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
has fundamentally changed our world.

150
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
In poor communities, in communities of color

151
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
there is this despair,

152
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
there is this hopelessness,

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
that is being shaped by these outcomes.

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
One out of three black men

155
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
between the ages of 18 and 30

156
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
In urban communities across this country --

158
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --

159
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are

160
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
in jail or prison or on probation or parole.

161
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Our system isn't just being shaped

162
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,

163
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
they're also distorted by poverty.

164
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
We have a system of justice in this country

165
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
that treats you much better

166
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.

167
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Wealth, not culpability,

168
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
shapes outcomes.

169
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.

170
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
The politics of fear and anger

171
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
have made us believe

172
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
that these are problems that are not our problems.

173
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
We've been disconnected.

174
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
It's interesting to me.

175
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.

176
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
My state of Alabama, like a number of states,

177
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
actually permanently disenfranchises you

178
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
if you have a criminal conviction.

179
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Right now in Alabama

180
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
34 percent of the black male population

181
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
has permanently lost the right to vote.

182
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
We're actually projecting in another 10 years

183
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
the level of disenfranchisement

184
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
will be as high as it's been

185
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

186
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,820
And there is this stunning silence.

187
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
I represent children.

188
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
A lot of my clients are very young.

189
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
The United States is the only country in the world

190
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
where we sentence 13-year-old children

191
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
to die in prison.

192
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.

193
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And we're actually doing some litigation.

194
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
The only country in the world.

195
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I represent people on death row.

196
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.

197
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
In many ways, we've been taught to think

198
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
that the real question is,

199
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?

200
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
And that's a very sensible question.

201
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
But there's another way of thinking

202
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
about where we are in our identity.

203
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
The other way of thinking about it

204
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,

205
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
but do we deserve to kill?

206
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I mean, it's fascinating.

207
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Death penalty in America is defined by error.

208
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
For every nine people who have been executed,

209
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
we've actually identified one innocent person

210
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
who's been exonerated and released from death row.

211
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
A kind of astonishing error rate --

212
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
one out of nine people innocent.

213
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
I mean, it's fascinating.

214
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes

215
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
if for every nine planes that took off

216
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
one would crash.

217
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

218
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
It's not our problem.

219
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
It's not our burden.

220
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
It's not our struggle.

221
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
I talk a lot about these issues.

222
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
I talk about race and this question

223
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
of whether we deserve to kill.

224
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,

225
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I tell them about slavery.

226
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
I tell them about terrorism,

227
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
the era that began at the end of reconstruction

228
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
that went on to World War II.

229
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
We don't really know very much about it.

230
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
But for African-Americans in this country,

231
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
that was an era defined by terror.

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.

233
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
They had to worry about being bombed.

234
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.

235
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And these older people come up to me now

236
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,

237
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
you tell people to stop saying

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history

239
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
after 9/11."

240
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."

241
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
And that era of terrorism, of course,

242
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
was followed by segregation

243
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
and decades of racial subordination

244
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and apartheid.

245
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic

246
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
where we really don't like to talk about our problems.

247
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
We don't like to talk about our history.

248
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
And because of that, we really haven't understood

249
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.

250
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
We're constantly running into each other.

251
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.

252
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
We have a hard time talking about race,

253
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves

254
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
to a process of truth and reconciliation.

255
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
In South Africa, people understood

256
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
that we couldn't overcome apartheid

257
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.

258
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,

259
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
but in this country we haven't done that.

260
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.

261
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
It was fascinating

262
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation

263
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling

264
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
to hear what you're talking about."

265
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.

266
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."

267
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
And the room got very quiet,

268
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and this woman said,

269
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,820
"There's no way, with our history,

270
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
we could ever engage

271
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
in the systematic killing of human beings.

272
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
It would be unconscionable for us

273
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
to, in an intentional and deliberate way,

274
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
set about executing people."

275
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
And I thought about that.

276
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
What would it feel like

277
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
to be living in a world

278
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
where the nation state of Germany was executing people,

279
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?

280
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
I couldn't bear it.

281
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
It would be unconscionable.

282
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
And yet, in this country,

283
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
in the states of the Old South,

284
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
we execute people --

285
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty

286
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
if the victim is white than if the victim is black,

287
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
22 times more likely to get it

288
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
if the defendant is black and the victim is white --

289
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
in the very states where there are buried in the ground

290
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
the bodies of people who were lynched.

291
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,820
And yet, there is this disconnect.

292
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.

293
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
That when we actually don't care

294
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
about these difficult things,

295
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
the positive and wonderful things

296
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
are nonetheless implicated.

297
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
We love innovation.

298
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
We love technology. We love creativity.

299
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
We love entertainment.

300
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
But ultimately,

301
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
those realities

302
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
are shadowed by suffering,

303
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
abuse, degradation,

304
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
marginalization.

305
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
And for me, it becomes necessary

306
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
to integrate the two.

307
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Because ultimately we are talking

308
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
about a need to be more hopeful,

309
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
more committed, more dedicated

310
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.

311
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
And for me that means

312
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
spending time thinking and talking

313
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
about the poor, the disadvantaged,

314
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
those who will never get to TED.

315
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
But thinking about them in a way

316
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
that is integrated in our own lives.

317
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.

318
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,820
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.

319
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Innovation, creativity,

320
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
development comes

321
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
not from the ideas in our mind alone.

322
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
They come from the ideas in our mind

323
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
that are also fueled

324
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
by some conviction in our heart.

325
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
And it's that mind-heart connection

326
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
that I believe compels us

327
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
to not just be attentive

328
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
to all the bright and dazzly things,

329
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
but also the dark and difficult things.

330
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.

331
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,

332
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
we wanted all kinds of things,

333
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
but mostly what we needed was hope,

334
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
an orientation of the spirit,

335
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places

336
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
and be a witness."

337
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Well that orientation of the spirit

338
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
is very much at the core of what I believe

339
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
even TED communities

340
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
have to be engaged in.

341
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
There is no disconnect

342
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
around technology and design

343
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
that will allow us to be fully human

344
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
until we pay attention to suffering,

345
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.

346
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Now I will warn you

347
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
that this kind of identity

348
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
is a much more challenging identity

349
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
than ones that don't pay attention to this.

350
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
It will get to you.

351
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.

352
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,

353
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,

354
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
these older women,

355
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Johnnie Carr who was the organizer

356
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
of the Montgomery bus boycott --

357
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
amazing African-American woman --

358
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
and Virginia Durr, a white woman,

359
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.

360
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
And these women would get together and just talk.

361
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,

362
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.

363
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Do you want to come over and listen?"

364
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."

365
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"

366
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I said, "I'm going to listen."

367
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.

368
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
It would be so energizing and so empowering.

369
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,

370
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me

371
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.

372
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Tell me what you're trying to do."

373
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
And I began giving her my rap.

374
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.

375
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.

376
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination

377
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
in the administration of criminal justice.

378
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.

379
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.

380
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
We're trying to reduce the prison population.

381
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
We're trying to end mass incarceration."

382
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me

383
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."

384
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."

385
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
(Laughter)

386
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,

387
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,820
she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."

388
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
And I actually believe that the TED community

389
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
needs to be more courageous.

390
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
We need to find ways

391
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
to embrace these challenges,

392
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
these problems, the suffering.

393
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Because ultimately, our humanity depends

394
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
on everyone's humanity.

395
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.

396
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
It's just taught me very simple things.

397
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I've come to understand and to believe

398
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
that each of us

399
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
is more than the worst thing we've ever done.

400
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I believe that for every person on the planet.

401
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.

402
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,

403
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
they're not just a thief.

404
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.

405
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And because of that there's this basic human dignity

406
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
that must be respected by law.

407
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I also believe

408
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
that in many parts of this country,

409
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and certainly in many parts of this globe,

410
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.

411
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
I don't believe that.

412
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
I actually think, in too many places,

413
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
the opposite of poverty is justice.

414
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
And finally, I believe

415
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic

416
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
and so beautiful and so inspiring

417
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
and so stimulating,

418
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,

419
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
we won't be judged by our design,

420
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.

421
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,

422
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,

423
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
but by how they treat the poor,

424
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
the condemned, the incarcerated.

425
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Because it's in that nexus

426
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
that we actually begin to understand truly profound things

427
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
about who we are.

428
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.

429
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
I sometimes push too hard.

430
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
I do get tired, as we all do.

431
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking

432
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
in ways that are important.

433
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
And I've been representing these kids

434
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.

435
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,

436
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,820
and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.

437
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?

438
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
How can a judge turn you into something

439
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
that you're not?

440
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.

441
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,

442
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,

443
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
the judge must have magic power.

444
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.

445
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
You should ask for some of that.

446
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,

447
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
I started working on a motion.

448
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.

449
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
And I started working on this motion,

450
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,

451
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
14-year-old black male client

452
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
like a privileged, white 75-year-old

453
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
corporate executive."

454
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,820
(Applause)

455
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
And I put in my motion

456
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.

457
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,

458
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
it's all misconduct.

459
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,

460
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
or did I actually write it?

461
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
And to my horror, not only had I written it,

462
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
but I had sent it to court.

463
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
(Applause)

464
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,820
A couple months went by,

465
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
and I had just forgotten all about it.

466
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
And I finally decided,

467
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.

468
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
And I got into my car

469
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.

470
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.

471
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.

472
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.

473
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,

474
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.

475
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
When this man saw me, he came over to me

476
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
and he said, "Who are you?"

477
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."

478
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
And this man came over to me

479
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
and he hugged me.

480
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
And he whispered in my ear.

481
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
He said, "I'm so proud of you."

482
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
And I have to tell you,

483
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
it was energizing.

484
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
It connected deeply with something in me

485
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
about identity,

486
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
about the capacity of every person to contribute

487
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.

488
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Well I went into the courtroom.

489
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.

490
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"

491
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.

492
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.

493
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I had written these crazy things.

494
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
And police officers were coming in

495
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.

496
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people

497
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
angry that we were talking about race,

498
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
that we were talking about poverty,

499
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
that we were talking about inequality.

500
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.

501
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.

502
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
He kept pacing back and forth.

503
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,820
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face

504
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,820
came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,

505
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
almost at counsel table.

506
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.

507
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended

508
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
that the janitor had come into court.

509
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.

510
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"

511
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
And this older black man stood up

512
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me

513
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,820
and he said, "I came into this courtroom

514
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
to tell this young man,

515
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,820
keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."

516
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
I've come to TED

517
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
because I believe that many of you understand

518
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
that the moral arc of the universe is long,

519
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
but it bends toward justice.

520
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
That we cannot be full evolved human beings

521
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
until we care about human rights and basic dignity.

522
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
That all of our survival

523
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
is tied to the survival of everyone.

524
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
That our visions of technology and design

525
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
and entertainment and creativity

526
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
have to be married with visions

527
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
of humanity, compassion and justice.

528
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
And more than anything,

529
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
for those of you who share that,

530
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I've simply come to tell you

531
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

532
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Thank you very much.

533
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:25,820
(Applause)

534
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw

535
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
an obvious desire by this audience, this community,

536
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.

537
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Other than writing a check,

538
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
what could we do?

539
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.

540
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
If you live in the state of California, for example,

541
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
there's a referendum coming up this spring

542
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
where actually there's going to be an effort

543
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,820
to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.

544
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
For example, here in California

545
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
we're going to spend one billion dollars

546
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,820
on the death penalty in the next five years --

547
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,820
one billion dollars.

548
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,820
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases

549
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
don't result in arrest.

550
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.

551
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
So there's an opportunity to change that.

552
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
And this referendum would propose having those dollars

553
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,820
go to law enforcement and safety.

554
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

555
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
CA: There's been this huge decline

556
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
in crime in America over the last three decades.

557
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,820
And part of the narrative of that

558
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,820
is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.

559
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
What would you say to someone who believed that?

560
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate

561
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
has remained relatively stable.

562
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country

563
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
wasn't really in violent crime categories.

564
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
It was this misguided war on drugs.

565
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
That's where the dramatic increases have come

566
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,820
in our prison population.

567
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,820
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.

568
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
And so we have three strikes laws

569
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
that put people in prison forever

570
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,820
for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,

571
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
rather than making them give those resources back

572
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
to the people who they victimized.

573
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,

574
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
not do less.

575
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
And I think our current punishment philosophy

576
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
does nothing for no one.

577
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,820
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.

578
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
(Applause)

579
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,820
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.

580
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
You're an inspiring person.

581
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

582
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:30,820
(Applause)
