00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:15,106
On March 10, 2011,

2
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:18,113
I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab

3
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:21,342
meeting with faculty, students and staff,

4
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:23,131
and we were trying to figure out whether

5
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,491
I should be the next director.

6
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,860
That night, at midnight,

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,630
a magnitude 9 earthquake

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,496
hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.

9
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,781
My wife and family were in Japan,

10
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:38,091
and as the news started to come in,

11
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:39,790
I was panicking.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,052
I was looking at the news streams

13
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:43,880
and listening to the press conferences

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,090
of the government officials

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,680
and the Tokyo Power Company,

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,231
and hearing about this explosion

17
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,430
at the nuclear reactors

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,111
and this cloud of fallout

19
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:55,010
that was headed towards our house

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,909
which was only about 200 kilometers away.

21
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,740
And the people on TV weren't telling us

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,680
anything that we wanted to hear.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,640
I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,062
what was going on with the radiation,

25
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:08,390
whether my family was in danger.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,579
So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,

27
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,250
which was to go onto the Internet

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,592
and try to figure out

29
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:17,003
if I could take matters into my own hands.

30
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,844
On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people

31
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,910
like me trying to figure out what was going on,

32
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,126
and together we sort of loosely formed a group

33
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,597
and we called it Safecast,

34
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:26,769
and we decided we were going to try

35
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,515
to measure the radiation

36
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,289
and get the data out to everybody else,

37
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,961
because it was clear that the government

38
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,863
wasn't going to be doing this for us.

39
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:36,280
Three years later,

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,374
we have 16 million data points,

41
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:42,119
we have designed our own Geiger counters

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,772
that you can download the designs

43
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:44,646
and plug it into the network.

44
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,550
We have an app that shows you

45
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,577
most of the radiation in Japan
and other parts of the world.

46
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,782
We are arguably one of the most successful

47
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:53,637
citizen science projects in the world,

48
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,989
and we have created

49
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:59,490
the largest open dataset of radiation measurements.

50
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,232
And the interesting thing here

51
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:06,880
is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,971
How did a bunch of amateurs

53
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,140
who really didn't know what we were doing

54
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,829
somehow come together

55
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:16,013
and do what NGOs and the government

56
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:18,431
were completely incapable of doing?

57
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,189
And I would suggest that this has something to do

58
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,949
with the Internet. It's not a fluke.

59
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:25,800
It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,218
It helped that it was an event

61
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:28,853
that pulled everybody together,

62
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,611
but it was a new way of doing things

63
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,690
that was enabled by the Internet

64
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,282
and a lot of the other things that were going on,

65
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:36,295
and I want to talk a little bit about

66
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,964
what those new principles are.

67
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:43,772
So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)

68
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,560
I call this B.I. Okay?

69
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,171
So, in B.I., life was simple.

70
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,917
Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,

71
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,376
somewhat predictable.

72
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,786
People actually tried to predict the future,

73
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,500
even the economists.

74
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,714
And then the Internet happened,

75
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,785
and the world became extremely complex,

76
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,422
extremely low-cost, extremely fast,

77
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:07,540
and those Newtonian laws

78
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,339
that we so dearly cherished

79
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,536
turned out to be just local ordinances,

80
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,287
and what we found was that in this

81
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:15,900
completely unpredictable world

82
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,932
that most of the people who were surviving

83
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,265
were working with sort of a different set of principles,

84
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,896
and I want to talk a little bit about that.

85
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,260
Before the Internet, if you remember,

86
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,165
when we tried to create services,

87
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,191
what you would do is you'd create

88
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,503
the hardware layer and the
network layer and the software

89
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,531
and it would cost millions of dollars

90
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,838
to do anything that was substantial.

91
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,277
So when it costs millions of dollars
to do something substantial,

92
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,349
what you would do is you'd get an MBA

93
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,807
who would write a plan

94
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:41,750
and get the money

95
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,494
from V.C.s or big companies,

96
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,607
and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,

97
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:46,630
and they'd build the thing.

98
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,249
This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.

99
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,556
What happened after the Internet was

100
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,312
the cost of innovation went down so much

101
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,799
because the cost of collaboration,
the cost of distribution,

102
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,442
the cost of communication, and Moore's Law

103
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,118
made it so that the cost of trying a new thing

104
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,512
became nearly zero,

105
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,781
and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,

106
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,552
students that didn't have permission —

107
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,925
permissionless innovation —

108
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,545
didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,

109
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:13,648
they just built the thing,

110
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,092
then they raised the money,

111
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,293
and then they sort of figured out a business plan

112
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:19,650
and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.

113
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,961
So the Internet caused innovation,

114
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,085
at least in software and services,

115
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,944
to go from an MBA-driven innovation model

116
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:29,847
to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,

117
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,945
and it pushed innovation to the edges,

118
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,491
to the dorm rooms, to the startups,

119
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,177
away from the large institutions,

120
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:37,532
the stodgy old institutions that had the power

121
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,219
and the money and the authority.

122
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,828
And we all know this. We all know
this happened on the Internet.

123
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,593
It turns out it's happening in other things, too.

124
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:47,835
Let me give you some examples.

125
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:50,620
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.

126
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,662
We do all kinds of things.

127
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,547
We do biology, we do hardware,

128
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:57,168
and Nicholas Negroponte
famously said, "Demo or die,"

129
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,890
as opposed to "Publish or perish,"

130
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,133
which was the traditional academic way of thinking.

131
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,695
And he often said, the demo only has to work once,

132
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,511
because the primary mode of us impacting the world

133
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,289
was through large companies

134
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:10,552
being inspired by us

135
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:14,068
and creating products like
the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.

136
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:16,010
But today, with the ability

137
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,319
to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,

138
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,469
I'm changing the motto now,

139
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,282
and this is the official public statement.

140
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:24,779
I'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."

141
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,000
You have to get the stuff into the real world

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,356
for it to really count,

143
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,235
and sometimes it will be large companies,

144
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:32,192
and Nicholas can talk about satellites.

145
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,478
(Applause)

146
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,560
Thank you.

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,334
But we should be getting out there ourselves

148
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:39,918
and not depending on large
institutions to do it for us.

149
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,620
So last year, we sent a bunch
of students to Shenzhen,

150
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,200
and they sat on the factory floors

151
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,505
with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.

152
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,982
What was happening there

153
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:50,166
was you would have these manufacturing devices,

154
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,359
and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.

155
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,824
They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment

156
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:58,034
and innovating right on the
manufacturing equipment.

157
00:05:58,034 --> 00:05:59,920
The factory was in the designer,

158
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,194
and the designer was literally in the factory.

159
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,820
And so what you would do is,

160
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,061
you'd go down to the stalls

161
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,617
and you would see these cell phones.

162
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,142
So instead of starting little websites

163
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,690
like the kids in Palo Alto do,

164
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,230
the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.

165
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,927
They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto

166
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,185
make websites,

167
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,298
and so there's a rainforest

168
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,854
of innovation going on in the cell phone.

169
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:23,454
What they do is, they make a cell phone,

170
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,678
go down to the stall, they sell some,

171
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,003
they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,

172
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,594
make a couple thousand more, go down.

173
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,585
Doesn't this sound like a software thing?

174
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,232
It sounds like agile software development,

175
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,160
A/B testing and iteration,

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,243
and what we thought you could only do with software

177
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,513
kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.

178
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:42,980
My next fellow, I hope, is going to be

179
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,465
one of these innovators from Shenzhen.

180
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:46,130
And so what you see is

181
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,099
that is pushing innovation to the edges.

182
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,204
We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,

183
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:52,195
and that's great, but this is Limor.

184
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,454
She is one of our favorite graduates,

185
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,530
and she is standing in front of a Samsung

186
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,363
Techwin Pick and Place Machine.

187
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:02,287
This thing can put 23,000 components per hour

188
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,280
onto an electronics board.

189
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,103
This is a factory in a box.

190
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:08,601
So what used to take a factory full of workers

191
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,620
working by hand

192
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,329
in this little box in New York,

193
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,379
she's able to have effectively —

194
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,012
She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen

195
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,256
to do this manufacturing.

196
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:17,517
She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.

197
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:19,760
So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,

198
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,450
the cost of prototyping, distribution,
manufacturing, hardware,

199
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,913
is getting so low

200
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,230
that innovation is being pushed to the edges

201
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,658
and students and startups are being able to build it.

202
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,536
This is a recent thing, but this will happen

203
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,019
and this will change

204
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,444
just like it did with software.

205
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:37,690
Sorona is a DuPont process

206
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,710
that uses a genetically engineered microbe

207
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,660
to turn corn sugar into polyester.

208
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,138
It's 30 percent more efficient
than the fossil fuel method,

209
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:50,797
and it's much better for the environment.

210
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,202
Genetic engineering and bioengineering

211
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,733
are creating a whole bunch

212
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,491
of great new opportunities

213
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,320
for chemistry, for computation, for memory.

214
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,370
We will probably be doing a lot,
obviously doing health things,

215
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,574
but we will probably be growing chairs

216
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,614
and buildings soon.

217
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:07,524
The problem is, Sorona costs
about 400 million dollars

218
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:08,905
and took seven years to build.

219
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,984
It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.

220
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,476
The thing is, the cost of innovation

221
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,062
in bioengineering is also going down.

222
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,031
This is desktop gene sequencer.

223
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,585
It used to cost millions and millions
of dollars to sequence genes.

224
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,329
Now you can do it on a desktop like this,

225
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,422
and kids can do this in dorm rooms.

226
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,110
This is Gen9 gene assembler,

227
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,189
and so right now when you try to print a gene,

228
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,457
what you do is somebody in a factory

229
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,397
with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,

230
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,748
you have one error per 100 base pairs,

231
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,324
and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.

232
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:39,710
This new device

233
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,384
assembles genes on a chip,

234
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,533
and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,

235
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,659
it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.

236
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,404
In this lab, we will have the world's capacity

237
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,507
of gene printing within a year,

238
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,119
200 million base pairs a year.

239
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,682
This is kind of like when we went

240
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,943
from transistor radios wrapped by hand

241
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,214
to the Pentium.

242
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,610
This is going to become the
Pentium of bioengineering,

243
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,646
pushing bioengineering into the hands

244
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,247
of dorm rooms and startup companies.

245
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:09,020
So it's happening in software and in hardware

246
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,983
and bioengineering,

247
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,264
and so this is a fundamental new
way of thinking about innovation.

248
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,941
It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,

249
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:18,145
it's chaotic, it's hard to control.

250
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,452
It's not bad, but it's very different,

251
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,419
and I think that the traditional rules that we have

252
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,491
for institutions don't work anymore,

253
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,170
and most of us here

254
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,253
operate with a different set of principles.

255
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,089
One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,

256
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,380
which is the idea of pulling resources

257
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,146
from the network as you need them

258
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,991
rather than stocking them in the center

259
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,576
and controlling everything.

260
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:42,340
So in the case of the Safecast story,

261
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,182
I didn't know anything when
the earthquake happened,

262
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,810
but I was able to find Sean

263
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,006
who was the hackerspace community organizer,

264
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,792
and Peter, the analog hardware hacker

265
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,508
who made our first Geiger counter,

266
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,506
and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island

267
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,840
monitoring system after the
Three Mile Island meltdown.

268
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,226
And these people I wouldn't have been able to find

269
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,660
beforehand and probably were better

270
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,787
that I found them just in time from the network.

271
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,654
I'm a three-time college dropout,

272
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:08,327
so learning over education

273
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:09,752
is very near and dear to my heart,

274
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:12,276
but to me, education is what people do to you

275
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,275
and learning is what you do to yourself.

276
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:19,051
(Applause)

277
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,810
And it feels like, and I'm biased,

278
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,607
it feels like they're trying to make you memorize

279
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:26,721
the whole encyclopedia before
they let you go out and play,

280
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:30,818
and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,

281
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,521
and it feels like they assume

282
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,308
you're going to be on top of some mountain

283
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,769
all by yourself with a number 2 pencil

284
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,152
trying to figure out what to do

285
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,268
when in fact you're always going to be connected,

286
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,913
you're always going to have friends,

287
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,872
and you can pull Wikipedia
up whenever you need it,

288
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:47,320
and what you need to learn is how to learn.

289
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,964
In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs

290
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,562
when we started three years ago,

291
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:54,070
I would argue that we probably as a group

292
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,486
know more than any other organization

293
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:59,695
about how to collect data and publish data

294
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:02,467
and do citizen science.

295
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,587
Compass over maps.

296
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:07,312
So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan

297
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:10,415
or mapping something is getting so expensive

298
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,588
and it's not very accurate or useful.

299
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:16,700
So in the Safecast story, we
knew we needed to collect data,

300
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,123
we knew we wanted to publish the data,

301
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:22,012
and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,

302
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:24,420
we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.

303
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,186
Oh, they've run out.

304
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,189
Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.

305
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,416
Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.

306
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,463
We can drive around. We can get volunteers.

307
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,342
We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.

308
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,333
We could not have planned this whole thing,

309
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,077
but by having a very strong compass,

310
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:39,512
we eventually got to where we were going,

311
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,930
and to me it's very similar to
agile software development,

312
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,288
but this idea of compasses is very important.

313
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,229
So I think the good news is

314
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:50,730
that even though the world is extremely complex,

315
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,122
what you need to do is very simple.

316
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,820
I think it's about stopping this notion

317
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,392
that you need to plan everything,

318
00:11:57,392 --> 00:11:58,484
you need to stock everything,

319
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,954
and you need to be so prepared,

320
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,948
and focus on being connected,

321
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:04,799
always learning,

322
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,660
fully aware,

323
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,440
and super present.

324
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,386
So I don't like the word "futurist."

325
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:17,001
I think we should be now-ists,

326
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,047
like we are right now.

327
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,890
Thank you.

328
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,869
(Applause)
