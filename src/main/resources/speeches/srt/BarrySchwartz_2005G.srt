1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,106
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
that's in this book of mine

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,227
that I hope will resonate with other
things you've already heard,

3
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,552
and I'll try to make
some connections myself,

4
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:21,896
in case you missed them.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,113
But I want to start with
what I call the "official dogma."

6
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,208
The official dogma of what?

7
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:31,538
The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.

8
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,875
And the official dogma runs like this:

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,597
if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:43,561
the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.

11
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,796
The reason for this is both that freedom
is in and of itself good,

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,942
valuable, worthwhile,
essential to being human.

13
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,796
And because if people have freedom,

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,796
then each of us can act on our own

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,106
to do the things
that will maximize our welfare,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,430
and no one has to decide on our behalf.

17
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,557
The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice.

18
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:11,248
The more choice people have,
the more freedom they have,

19
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,955
and the more freedom they have,

20
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,606
the more welfare they have.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,796
This, I think, is so deeply embedded
in the water supply

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,060
that it wouldn't occur
to anyone to question it.

23
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:28,796
And it's also deeply
embedded in our lives.

24
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,132
I'll give you some examples

25
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:34,796
of what modern progress
has made possible for us.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,173
This is my supermarket.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,917
Not such a big one.

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,059
I want to say just a word
about salad dressing.

29
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,796
175 salad dressings in my supermarket,

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,796
if you don't count the 10
extra-virgin olive oils

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,796
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,796
to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings,

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,573
in the off-chance that none of the 175
the store has on offer suit you.

34
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,233
So this is what the supermarket is like.

35
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:02,685
And then you go
to the consumer electronics store

36
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,304
to set up a stereo system --

37
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:07,796
speakers, CD player,
tape player, tuner, amplifier --

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,796
and in this one single
consumer electronics store,

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,099
there are that many stereo systems.

40
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,717
We can construct six-and-a-half-million
different stereo systems

41
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,399
out of the components
that are on offer in one store.

42
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,437
You've got to admit
that's a lot of choice.

43
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:29,796
In other domains --
the world of communications.

44
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,051
There was a time, when I was a boy,

45
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,892
when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted,

46
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,734
as long as it came from Ma Bell.

47
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,796
You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,011
One consequence of that, by the way,
is that the phone never broke.

49
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,796
And those days are gone.

50
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,796
We now have an almost
unlimited variety of phones,

51
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,796
especially in the world of cell phones.

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,058
These are cell phones of the future.

53
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,796
My favorite is the middle one --

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,005
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
and crème brûlée torch.

55
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,516
(Laughter)

56
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,796
And if by some chance you haven't
seen that in your store yet,

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,706
you can rest assured
that one day soon, you will.

58
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,907
And what this does

59
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:12,090
is it leads people to walk
into their stores asking this question.

60
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:15,273
And do you know what the answer
to this question now is?

61
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:16,812
The answer is "no."

62
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:20,796
It is not possible to buy a cell phone
that doesn't do too much.

63
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:25,796
So, in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things,

64
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,313
the same explosion of choice is true.

65
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,843
Health care.

66
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,400
It is no longer the case
in the United States

67
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:36,919
that you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you what to do.

68
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,959
Instead, you go to the doctor,

69
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:42,133
and the doctor tells you,
"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.

70
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:44,539
A has these benefits, and these risks.

71
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,768
B has these benefits, and these risks.

72
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:48,521
What do you want to do?"

73
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,172
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"

74
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,576
And the doc says, "A has
these benefits and risks,

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,558
and B has these benefits and risks.

76
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:58,121
What do you want to do?"

77
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:01,930
And you say, "If you were me,
Doc, what would you do?"

78
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,654
And the doc says, "But I'm not you."

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,638
And the result is --
we call it "patient autonomy,"

80
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:10,535
which makes it sound like a good thing,

81
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:13,622
but it really is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility

82
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,295
for decision-making from somebody
who knows something --

83
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,333
namely, the doctor --

84
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,089
to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick

85
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,796
and thus not in the best shape
to be making decisions --

86
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,692
namely, the patient.

87
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,542
There's enormous marketing
of prescription drugs

88
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:28,817
to people like you and me,

89
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,297
which, if you think about it,
makes no sense at all,

90
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,534
since we can't buy them.

91
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:35,011
Why do they market to us
if we can't buy them?

92
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:38,796
The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning

93
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,069
and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed.

94
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:46,329
Something as dramatic as our identity

95
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,113
has now become a matter of choice,

96
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:52,590
as this slide is meant to indicate.

97
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:55,442
We don't inherit an identity;
we get to invent it.

98
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,796
And we get to re-invent
ourselves as often as we like.

99
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,773
And that means that every day,
when you wake up in the morning,

100
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:04,732
you have to decide what kind
of person you want to be.

101
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,240
With respect to marriage and family,

102
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:14,085
there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had

103
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,211
is that you got married
as soon as you could,

104
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:18,845
and then you started having kids
as soon as you could.

105
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:21,724
The only real choice was who,

106
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:24,361
not when, and not what you did after.

107
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,796
Nowadays, everything
is very much up for grabs.

108
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,541
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,

109
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:34,339
and I assign 20 percent
less work than I used to.

110
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,796
And it's not because they're less smart,

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,213
and it's not because
they're less diligent.

112
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:42,690
It's because they are preoccupied,
asking themselves,

113
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,326
"Should I get married or not?
Should I get married now?

114
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,643
Should I get married later?

115
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,054
Should I have kids first,
or a career first?"

116
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,796
All of these are consuming questions.

117
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,916
And they're going to answer
these questions,

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,561
whether or not it means
not doing all the work I assign

119
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,639
and not getting a good grade
in my courses.

120
00:05:58,663 --> 00:05:59,797
And indeed they should.

121
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,155
These are important questions to answer.

122
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:04,870
Work --

123
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:07,189
we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,

124
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,190
with the technology that enables us

125
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:15,256
to work every minute of every day
from any place on the planet --

126
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,058
except the Randolph Hotel.

127
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,637
(Laughter)

128
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,430
(Applause)

129
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:24,796
There is one corner, by the way,

130
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,426
that I'm not going to tell anybody about,
where the WiFi actually works.

131
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,235
I'm not telling you about it
because I want to use it.

132
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,504
So what this means,

133
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,567
this incredible freedom of choice
we have with respect to work,

134
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:38,264
is that we have to make a decision,

135
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,376
again and again and again,

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,796
about whether we should
or shouldn't be working.

137
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,425
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,

138
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,426
and we have our cell phone on one hip,

139
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,497
and our Blackberry on our other hip,

140
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,231
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.

141
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,367
And even if they're all shut off,

142
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,462
every minute that we're watching
our kid mutilate a soccer game,

143
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,268
we are also asking ourselves,

144
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,318
"Should I answer this cell phone call?

145
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:04,215
Should I respond to this email?
Should I draft this letter?"

146
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,796
And even if the answer
to the question is "no,"

147
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,106
it's certainly going to make
the experience of your kid's soccer game

148
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,044
very different than it would've been.

149
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,527
So everywhere we look,

150
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:18,309
big things and small things,
material things and lifestyle things,

151
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,501
life is a matter of choice.

152
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:24,796
And the world we used
to live in looked like this.

153
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,031
[Well, actually,
they are written in stone.]

154
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,997
That is to say, there were some choices,

155
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,022
but not everything was a matter of choice.

156
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:33,181
And the world we now live in
looks like this.

157
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,781
[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]

158
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:38,536
And the question is,
is this good news, or bad news?

159
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,019
And the answer is, "yes."

160
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,431
(Laughter)

161
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:47,283
We all know what's good about it,

162
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,796
so I'm going to talk
about what's bad about it.

163
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,267
All of this choice has two effects,

164
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,240
two negative effects on people.

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,432
One effect, paradoxically,

166
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,913
is that it produces paralysis,
rather than liberation.

167
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,796
With so many options to choose from,

168
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,388
people find it very difficult
to choose at all.

169
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,796
I'll give you one very
dramatic example of this:

170
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,376
a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans.

171
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:23,251
A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard,

172
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,896
the gigantic mutual-fund company

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,796
of about a million employees
and about 2,000 different workplaces.

174
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,188
And what she found

175
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:34,480
is that for every 10 mutual funds
the employer offered,

176
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:38,186
rate of participation
went down two percent.

177
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,318
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent
fewer employees participate

178
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,999
than if you only offer five.

179
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,993
Why?

180
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,001
Because with 50 funds to choose from,

181
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:52,796
it's so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose,

182
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,868
that you'll just put it off
until tomorrow.

183
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,091
And then tomorrow,

184
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:58,092
and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

185
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,121
and of course tomorrow never comes.

186
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,274
Understand that not only does this mean

187
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,248
that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire

188
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:07,454
because they don't have
enough money put away,

189
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,065
it also means that making
the decision is so hard

190
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,796
that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer.

191
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,796
By not participating, they are passing up
as much as 5,000 dollars a year

192
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,117
from the employer,

193
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,240
who would happily
match their contribution.

194
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,500
So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices.

195
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,010
And I think it makes
the world look like this.

196
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:33,026
[And lastly, for all eternity,
French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]

197
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,796
(Laughter)

198
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,694
You really want to get the decision
right if it's for all eternity, right?

199
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:42,260
You don't want to pick the wrong
mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.

200
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,436
So that's one effect.

201
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,594
The second effect

202
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:50,176
is that even if we manage to overcome
the paralysis and make a choice,

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,113
we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice

204
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,796
than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from.

205
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,467
And there are several reasons for this.

206
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,189
One of them

207
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,170
is that with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from,

208
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:07,537
if you buy one, and it's not perfect --
and what salad dressing is? --

209
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,380
it's easy to imagine
you could have made a different choice

210
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:11,781
that would have been better.

211
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,796
And what happens

212
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,622
is this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made,

213
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:21,224
and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction

214
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,026
you get out of the decision you made,

215
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,628
even if it was a good decision.

216
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,154
The more options there are,
the easier it is to regret anything at all

217
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,702
that is disappointing
about the option that you chose.

218
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,796
Second, what economists
call "opportunity costs."

219
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,796
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

220
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,796
of talking about how much the way
in which we value things

221
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,796
depends on what we compare them to.

222
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,796
Well, when there are lots
of alternatives to consider,

223
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,975
it is easy to imagine
the attractive features

224
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,796
of alternatives that you reject

225
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,453
that make you less satisfied
with the alternative that you've chosen.

226
00:10:58,477 --> 00:10:59,560
Here's an example.

227
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:03,493
[I can't stop thinking about those other
available parking spaces on W 85th street]

228
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,057
Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.

229
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,090
Here's what you're
supposed to be thinking.

230
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,876
Here's this couple on the Hamptons.

231
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,196
Very expensive real estate.

232
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,196
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.
They have it all to themselves.

233
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,591
What could be better?

234
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:16,492
"Well, damn it," this guy is thinking,

235
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:20,490
"It's August. Everybody
in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.

236
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,348
I could be parking
right in front of my building."

237
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:28,232
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea

238
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,110
that he is missing the opportunity,

239
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,102
day after day, to have
a great parking space.

240
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,215
Opportunity costs

241
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,309
subtract from the satisfaction
we get out of what we choose,

242
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,166
even when what we choose is terrific.

243
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,967
And the more options
there are to consider,

244
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,197
the more attractive
features of these options

245
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:49,439
are going to be reflected
by us as opportunity costs.

246
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:51,422
Here's another example.

247
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:55,606
(Laughter)

248
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,129
Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.

249
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:01,551
It makes points about living
in the moment as well,

250
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,552
and probably about doing things slowly.

251
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:04,719
But one point it makes

252
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:06,904
is that whenever
you're choosing one thing,

253
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,796
you're choosing not to do other things

254
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,884
that may have lots of attractive features,

255
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:13,655
and it's going to make
what you're doing less attractive.

256
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,121
Third: escalation of expectations.

257
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:19,026
This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans.

258
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,796
I wear jeans almost all the time.

259
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:23,566
There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor,

260
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,661
and you bought them,
and they fit like crap,

261
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,375
they were incredibly uncomfortable,

262
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,796
if you wore them
and washed them enough times,

263
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,380
they started to feel OK.

264
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,945
I went to replace my jeans after years
of wearing these old ones,

265
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,820
and I said, "I want
a pair of jeans. Here's my size."

266
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,030
And the shopkeeper said,

267
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:41,796
"Do you want slim fit,
easy fit, relaxed fit?

268
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,201
You want button fly or zipper fly?
You want stonewashed or acid-washed?

269
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,590
Do you want them distressed?

270
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,451
You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah."
On and on he went.

271
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,624
My jaw dropped.

272
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:52,886
And after I recovered, I said,

273
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,910
"I want the kind that used
to be the only kind."

274
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,703
(Laughter)

275
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,797
He had no idea what that was,

276
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:03,978
(Laughter)

277
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:06,796
so I spent an hour trying on
all these damn jeans,

278
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,867
and I walked out of the store -- truth! --

279
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:11,532
with the best-fitting jeans
I had ever had.

280
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,715
I did better.

281
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:15,983
All this choice made
it possible for me to do better.

282
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:17,674
But --

283
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,118
I felt worse.

284
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:23,796
Why? I wrote a whole book
to try to explain this to myself.

285
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,162
The reason --

286
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:29,419
(Laughter)

287
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:31,796
The reason I felt worse is that,

288
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,534
with all of these options available,

289
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:39,739
my expectations about how good
a pair of jeans should be went up.

290
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,034
I had very low, no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor.

291
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,698
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
one of them should've been perfect.

292
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,059
And what I got was good,
but it wasn't perfect.

293
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,169
And so I compared what I got
to what I expected,

294
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:57,423
and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected.

295
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,058
Adding options to people's lives

296
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,686
can't help but increase
the expectations people have

297
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,796
about how good those options will be.

298
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,011
And what that's going to produce
is less satisfaction with results,

299
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,788
even when they're good results.

300
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:14,062
Nobody in the world
of marketing knows this.

301
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,855
[It all looks so great.
I can't wait to be disappointed.]

302
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,364
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know
what this was about.

303
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,683
The truth is more like this.

304
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:26,410
[Everything was better back
when everything was worse]

305
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:30,446
The reason that everything was better
back when everything was worse

306
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,612
is that when everything was worse,

307
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,407
it was actually possible for people

308
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,826
to have experiences
that were a pleasant surprise.

309
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,105
Nowadays, the world we live in --
we affluent, industrialized citizens,

310
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,956
with perfection the expectation --

311
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,861
the best you can ever hope for

312
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,550
is that stuff is as good
as you expect it to be.

313
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,416
You will never be pleasantly surprised

314
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,486
because your expectations,
my expectations,

315
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,859
have gone through the roof.

316
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:57,304
The secret to happiness --
this is what you all came for --

317
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,877
the secret to happiness

318
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,869
is low expectations.

319
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:05,137
(Laughter)

320
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,646
[You'll do]

321
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,828
(Applause)

322
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:11,161
(Laughter)

323
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,437
I want to say --

324
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:15,104
just a little autobiographical moment --

325
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,118
that I actually am married to a wife,

326
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,796
and she's really quite wonderful.

327
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,394
I couldn't have done better.

328
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,978
I didn't settle.

329
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,415
But settling isn't
always such a bad thing.

330
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:26,986
Finally --

331
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,217
One consequence of buying
a bad-fitting pair of jeans

332
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,289
when there is only one kind to buy

333
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,796
is that when you are dissatisfied,
and you ask why,

334
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,057
who's responsible,

335
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,589
the answer is clear:
the world is responsible.

336
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,206
What could you do?

337
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,198
When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available,

338
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,594
and you buy one that is disappointing,

339
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:48,796
and you ask why, who's responsible?

340
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,139
It is equally clear that the answer
to the question is "you."

341
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,796
You could have done better.

342
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,796
With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display,

343
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,796
there is no excuse for failure.

344
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,204
And so when people make decisions,

345
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,796
and even though the results
of the decisions are good,

346
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,546
they feel disappointed about them;

347
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,547
they blame themselves.

348
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,522
Clinical depression has exploded

349
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,037
in the industrial world
in the last generation.

350
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:18,796
I believe a significant -- not the only,
but a significant -- contributor

351
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,093
to this explosion of depression,
and also suicide,

352
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,796
is that people have experiences
that are disappointing

353
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,678
because their standards are so high,

354
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,894
and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves,

355
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,260
they think they're at fault.

356
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,796
And so the net result is that we do
better in general, objectively,

357
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,830
and we feel worse.

358
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,374
So let me remind you.

359
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:45,796
This is the official dogma,
the one that we all take to be true,

360
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,934
and it's all false.

361
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:49,528
It is not true.

362
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:54,311
There's no question that some choice
is better than none,

363
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,434
but it doesn't follow from that

364
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,796
that more choice
is better than some choice.

365
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,697
There's some magical amount.
I don't know what it is.

366
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,614
I'm pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point

367
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,724
where options improve our welfare.

368
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:10,128
Now, as a policy matter
-- I'm almost done --

369
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:13,637
as a policy matter,
the thing to think about is this:

370
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:16,283
what enables all of this choice

371
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:20,378
in industrial societies
is material affluence.

372
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:23,107
There are lots of places in the world,

373
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,096
and we have heard about several of them,

374
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,882
where their problem
is not that they have too much choice.

375
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,004
Their problem
is that they have too little.

376
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,796
So the stuff I'm talking about
is the peculiar problem

377
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,468
of modern, affluent, Western societies.

378
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:39,717
And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this:

379
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,011
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday

380
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:48,290
about how these expensive
and difficult-to-install child seats

381
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,924
don't help.

382
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,481
It's a waste of money.

383
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,790
What I'm telling you

384
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:57,015
is that these expensive,
complicated choices --

385
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,203
it's not simply that they don't help.

386
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:00,796
They actually hurt.

387
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,203
They actually make us worse off.

388
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:07,499
If some of what enables
people in our societies

389
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:09,522
to make all of the choices we make

390
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:14,134
were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options,

391
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,438
not only would those
people's lives be improved,

392
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,796
but ours would be improved also,

393
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,797
which is what economists call
a "Pareto-improving move."

394
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:25,533
Income redistribution will make
everyone better off --

395
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,969
not just poor people --

396
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,900
because of how all this excess
choice plagues us.

397
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:31,582
So to conclude.

398
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,916
[You can be anything
you want to be -- no limits]

399
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,579
You're supposed to read this cartoon,
and, being a sophisticated person, say,

400
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,058
"Ah! What does this fish know?

401
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:42,179
You know, nothing is possible
in this fishbowl."

402
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:45,176
Impoverished imagination,
a myopic view of the world --

403
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,034
and that's the way I read it at first.

404
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,875
The more I thought about it, however,

405
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,437
the more I came to the view
that this fish knows something.

406
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,796
Because the truth of the matter

407
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,289
is that if you shatter the fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

408
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:00,726
you don't have freedom.

409
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,344
You have paralysis.

410
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:06,289
If you shatter this fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

411
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,251
you decrease satisfaction.

412
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:13,576
You increase paralysis,
and you decrease satisfaction.

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,265
Everybody needs a fishbowl.

414
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,868
This one is almost
certainly too limited --

415
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:21,129
perhaps even for the fish,
certainly for us.

416
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:25,518
But the absence of some metaphorical
fishbowl is a recipe for misery,

417
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,327
and, I suspect, disaster.

418
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,090
Thank you very much.

419
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:30,756
(Applause)
