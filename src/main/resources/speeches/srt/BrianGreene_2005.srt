1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
In the year 1919,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,820
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:28,820
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
He proposed that our universe

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
might actually have more than the three dimensions

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
that we are all aware of.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that for some reason we don't yet see.

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
but it has nothing to do with the world around us.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
This particular idea, however --

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
may tell us whether it's right or wrong --

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,820
this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,820
So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
So where do we go?

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
of having discovered the special theory of relativity

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and decides to take on a new project,

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,820
to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.

26
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
And in that moment, there are many people around

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,820
who thought that that project had already been resolved.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,820
that works well, describes the motion of planets,

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
the motion of the moon and so forth,

31
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
hitting people on the head.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
All of that could be described using Newton's work.

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,820
But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
because even Newton had written

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,820
that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,820
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself --

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
to figure out how gravity works.

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And let me show you what it is that he found.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
So Einstein found

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,820
that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
The idea goes like this:

47
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
imagine space is a substrate of all there is.

48
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.

49
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.

51
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And that communicates the force of gravity.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Even the Earth warps space around it.

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Now look at the Moon.

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,

55
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment

56
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,820
that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
We go to a full-frame view of this.

58
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
The Earth itself is kept in orbit

59
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,820
because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
because of the Sun's presence.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,820
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
It really works. It describes the data.

64
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.

65
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.

66
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.

67
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
That's one theory

68
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,820
that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,

69
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,820
one set of principles, one master equation, if you will.

70
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
So Kaluza said to himself,

71
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Einstein has been able to describe gravity

72
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
in terms of warps and curves in space --

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
in fact, space and time, to be more precise.

74
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force,

75
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
we know of others today, but at that time

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
that was the only other one people were thinking about.

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
You know, the force responsible for electricity

79
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
and magnetic attraction and so forth.

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game

81
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,820
Einstein had already used up space and time,

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
warps and curves, to describe gravity.

85
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.

86
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,820
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.

87
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
He said, if I want to describe one more force,

88
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
maybe I need one more dimension.

89
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,820
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,820
and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves

91
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves

93
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
in a universe with four space dimensions, not three,

94
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,820
he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --

95
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
those were for gravity --

96
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,820
but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.

97
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
And when he looked at that equation,

98
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
it was none other than the equation

99
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.

100
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Amazing -- it just popped out.

101
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
He was so excited by this realization

102
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
that he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --

103
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
that he had found the unified theory.

104
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.

105
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
He, in fact --

106
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
he read a book, a treatise on swimming --

108
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
(Laughter)

109
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
-- then dove into the ocean.

110
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.

111
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
two questions immediately arise from his observation.

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?

114
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
We don't seem to see them.

115
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,820
And number two: does this theory really work in detail,

116
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
when you try to apply it to the world around us?

117
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Now, the first question was answered in 1926

118
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
by a fellow named Oskar Klein.

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,820
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --

120
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,

121
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,

122
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
curled up so small, even though they're all around us,

123
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
that we don't see them.

124
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Let me show you that one visually.

125
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
So, imagine you're looking at something

126
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
like a cable supporting a traffic light.

127
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --

128
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,820
but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,

129
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.

130
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.

131
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,

132
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
a little ant walking around --

133
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --

134
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
the long dimension,

135
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.

136
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
And I hope you appreciate this.

137
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
It took so long to get these ants to do this.

138
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
(Laughter)

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,820
big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us

141
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
are the ones that we can easily see,

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
but there might be additional dimensions curled up,

143
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
sort of like the circular part of that cable,

144
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,820
so small that they have so far remained invisible.

145
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Let me show you what that would look like.

146
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself --

147
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Some of you guys will fix that one day,

149
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,

150
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
goes smaller, smaller, smaller,

151
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,820
and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,

152
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,820
this is the idea,

153
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
you could have additional curled up dimensions --

154
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.

155
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,820
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,

156
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --

157
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
that's like the grid part --

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension

159
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye

160
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
or even with any of our most refined equipment.

161
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,

162
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,820
the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.

163
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Now that's an explanation

164
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,820
about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.

165
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
But what about the second question that I asked:

166
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
does the theory actually work

167
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
when you try to apply it to the real world?

168
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others

169
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,820
worked on trying to refine this framework

170
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
and apply it to the physics of the universe

171
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,820
as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.

172
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
In detail, for instance,

173
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
they couldn't get the mass of the electron

174
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
to work out correctly in this theory.

175
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,820
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,

176
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,820
this strange but very compelling idea

177
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.

178
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Until something wonderful happened in our age.

179
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics

180
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
is being pursued by physicists such as myself,

181
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
many others around the world,

182
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.

183
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,820
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory

184
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,820
has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
but when we study superstring theory,

186
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.

187
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
So, let me just tell you how that goes.

188
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Superstring theory -- what is it?

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:

190
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,820
what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents

191
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,820
making up everything in the world around us?

192
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
The idea is like this.

193
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,820
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,

194
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.

195
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.

196
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,820
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.

197
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.

198
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,820
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus

199
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
with neutrons and protons.

200
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.

201
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
That is where conventional ideas stop.

202
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Here is the new idea of string theory.

203
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else.

204
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.

205
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
It looks like a vibrating string --

206
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
that's where the idea, string theory comes from.

207
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello

208
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
can vibrate in different patterns,

209
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
these can also vibrate in different patterns.

210
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
They don't produce different musical notes.

211
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.

212
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
So if these ideas are correct,

213
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,820
this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.

214
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
It's built up of a huge number

215
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,820
of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,

216
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
vibrating in different frequencies.

217
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
The different frequencies produce the different particles.

218
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
The different particles are responsible

219
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
for all the richness in the world around us.

220
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
And there you see unification,

221
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
because matter particles, electrons and quarks,

222
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,820
radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.

223
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,820
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together

224
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
under the rubric of vibrating strings.

225
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,820
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.

226
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Now here is the catch.

227
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
When you study the mathematics of string theory,

228
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
you find that it doesn't work

229
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.

230
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,820
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.

231
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works

232
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,820
only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space

233
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
and one dimension of time.

234
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,820
It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --

235
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
that our world, when appropriately described,

236
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

237
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Now you might think about that and say, well,

238
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,

239
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.

240
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,

241
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,820
and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.

242
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
One of the other predictions of string theory --

243
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.

244
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
(Laughter)

245
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
But it raises the question:

246
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,

247
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
or do they tell us something about the world?

248
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,820
In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,820
First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions

250
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,820
hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question

251
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
in theoretical physics, theoretical science.

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
And that question is this: when we look around the world,

253
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
as scientists have done for the last hundred years,

254
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.

255
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
These are numbers like the mass of the particles,

256
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,

257
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
the strength of the electromagnetic force --

258
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
a list of about 20 numbers

259
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
that have been measured with incredible precision,

260
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
but nobody has an explanation

261
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,820
for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.

262
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Now, does string theory offer an answer?

263
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Not yet.

264
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,820
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do

265
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
may rely on the form of the extra dimensions.

266
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers

267
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
had any other values than the known ones,

268
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.

269
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
This is a deep question.

270
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Why are those numbers so finely tuned

271
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
to allow stars to shine and planets to form,

272
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --

273
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
if I had 20 dials up here

274
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,

275
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,820
almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.

276
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
So can we explain those 20 numbers?

277
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers

278
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
have to do with the extra dimensions.

279
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Let me show you how.

280
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,

281
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
it's not one extra dimension,

282
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,820
as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.

283
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.

284
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.

285
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,820
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --

286
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
name isn't all that important.

287
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
But, as you can see,

288
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
the extra dimensions fold in on themselves

289
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,820
and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.

290
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,820
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,

291
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,820
then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us

292
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
would look like this on the tiniest of scales.

293
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
When you swing your hand,

294
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,

295
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.

296
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?

297
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Consider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,

298
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
notice that the vibrations of the airstreams

299
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
are affected by the shape of the instrument.

300
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Now in string theory,

301
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.

302
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
So just as those airstreams

303
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,

304
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
strings themselves will be affected

305
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.

306
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
So let me bring some strings into the story.

307
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --

308
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
they'll be there in a second -- right there,

309
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
notice that they way they vibrate is affected

310
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
by the geometry of the extra dimensions.

311
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --

312
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
we don't yet, but if we did --

313
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
we should be able to calculate the allowed notes,

314
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
the allowed vibrational patterns.

315
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,

316
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.

317
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,820
And if the answer that we get from our calculations

318
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
agrees with the values of those numbers

319
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
that have been determined

320
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
through detailed and precise experimentation,

321
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,820
this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation

322
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,820
for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.

323
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:

324
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,820
how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?

325
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure

326
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
that might be able to explain

327
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,820
some previously unexplained features of the world,

328
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
or can we actually test for these extra dimensions?

329
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
And we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --

330
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,820
that in the next five years or so we may be able to test

331
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
for the existence of these extra dimensions.

332
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,

333
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,820
a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.

334
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,

335
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
opposite directions, near the speed of light.

336
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other,

337
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
so there's a head-on collision.

338
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy,

339
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
it may eject some of the debris from the collision

340
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,820
from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.

341
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
How would we know it?

342
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,

343
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
compare it to the amount of energy before,

344
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,820
and if there's less energy after the collision than before,

345
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.

346
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,820
And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,

347
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.

348
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Let me show you that idea visually.

349
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --

350
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,

351
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
if the extra dimensions are real.

352
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
But here's how the experiment will go.

353
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820
You take these particles. You slam them together.

354
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
You slam them together, and if we are right,

355
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
some of the energy of that collision

356
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.

357
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
So this is the kind of experiment

358
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,820
that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.

359
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820
And if this experiment bears fruit,

360
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
if we see that kind of particle ejected

361
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions

362
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
than when we began,

363
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
this will show that the extra dimensions are real.

364
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
And to me this is a really remarkable story,

365
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,820
and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --

366
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage

367
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
in which the events of the universe take place.

368
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
Einstein comes along and says,

369
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.

370
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,820
And now string theory comes along and says,

371
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,

372
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
all together in one package,

373
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,820
but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

374
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,820
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.

375
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Amazing possibility.

376
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Thank you very much.

377
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,820
