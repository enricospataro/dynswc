1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
So since I was here last in '06,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
we discovered that global climate change

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
so we covered that fairly extensively

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
in Skeptic magazine.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
We investigate all kinds

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
because the world's going to end in 2012.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
Another update:

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
You will recall I introduced you guys

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
to the Quadro Tracker.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
It's like a water dowsing device.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
And you walk around, and it points to things.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
it'll point right to somebody.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
This particular one that was given to me

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
finds golf balls,

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
especially if you're at a golf course

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
and you check under enough bushes.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
this device, the ADE 651,

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
was sold to the Iraqi government

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
for 40,000 dollars apiece.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
It's just like this one, completely worthless,

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
magnetic ion attraction,"

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
which translates to

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
but it does absolutely nothing.

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
In this case, at trespass points,

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
allowing people to go through

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
because your little tracker device said they were okay,

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
actually cost lives.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
in believing in this sort of thing.

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
So what I want to talk about today is belief.

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
I want to believe,

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
and you do too.

43
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
belief is the natural state of things.

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
It is the default option. We just believe.

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
We believe all sorts of things.

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Belief is natural;

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

49
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
It's more difficult.

50
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.

51
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"

52
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,

53
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
and the reason for that is because

54
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
we have a belief engine in our brains.

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
And sometimes A really is connected to B,

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and that's called association learning.

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
We find patterns, we make those connections,

60
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
whether it's Pavlov's dog here

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
associating the sound of the bell with the food,

62
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,

63
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
in which he's having an association

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
between his behavior and a reward for it,

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
and therefore he repeats the behavior.

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
In fact, what Skinner discovered

68
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,

69
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
and he has to press one of these two keys,

70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --

72
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
if you just randomly assign rewards

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
such that there is no pattern,

74
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
they will figure out any kind of pattern.

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
they repeat that particular pattern.

77
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
once clockwise and peck the key twice.

79
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
And that's called superstition,

80
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
and that, I'm afraid,

81
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
we will always have with us.

82
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
I call this process "patternicity" --

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns

84
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.

85
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
A Type I error, or false positive,

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
is believing a pattern is real

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
when it's not.

89
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Our second type of error is a false negative.

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
A Type II error is not believing

91
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
a pattern is real when it is.

92
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
So let's do a thought experiment.

93
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
You are a hominid three million years ago

94
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
walking on the plains of Africa.

95
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Your name is Lucy, okay?

96
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
And you hear a rustle in the grass.

97
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Is it a dangerous predator,

98
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
or is it just the wind?

99
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.

100
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator

101
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
and it turns out it's just the wind,

102
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
you've made an error in cognition,

103
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
made a Type I error, false positive.

104
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
But no harm. You just move away.

105
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,

107
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,

108
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
you're lunch.

109
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
You've just won a Darwin award.

110
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
You've been taken out of the gene pool.

111
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Now the problem here is that

112
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
patternicities will occur whenever the cost

113
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
of making a Type I error

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.

115
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.

116
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
We have a pattern detection problem

117
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error

118
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
is highly problematic,

119
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.

120
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
So the default position

121
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
is just: Believe all patterns are real --

122
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators

123
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
and not just the wind.

124
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
And so I think that we evolved ...

125
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,

126
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
our pattern-seeking brain processes,

127
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
to always find meaningful patterns

128
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
and infuse them with these sort of

129
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.

130
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
So for example, what do you see here?

131
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
It's a horse head, that's right.

132
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.

133
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
That's a pattern.

134
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
And is it really a horse?

135
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Or is it more like a frog?

136
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
See, our pattern detection device,

137
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --

138
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
it's our little detection device there --

139
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.

140
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
For example, what do you see here?

141
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Yes, of course, it's a cow.

142
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --

143
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
once I prime the brain to see it,

144
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.

145
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
And what do you see here?

146
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.

147
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.

148
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
So when I go back without the prime,

149
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
your brain already has the model

150
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
so you can see it again.

151
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
What do you see here?

152
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.

153
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
How about here?

154
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Just shout out anything you see.

155
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
That's a good audience, Chris.

156
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.

157
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,820
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson

158
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
at U.T. Austin

159
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
on corporate environments

160
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control

161
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
makes people see illusory patterns.

162
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.

163
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control

164
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
are more likely to see something in this,

165
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
which is allegedly patternless.

166
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns

167
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
goes up when there's a lack of control.

168
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious

169
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
when they're batting,

170
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
but not so much when they're fielding.

171
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Because fielders are successful

172
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
90 to 95 percent of the time.

173
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.

174
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
So their superstitions, their patternicities,

175
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
are all associated with feelings of lack of control

176
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
and so forth.

177
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

178
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Anybody see an object there?

179
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
There actually is something here,

180
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
but it's degraded.

181
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
While you're thinking about that,

182
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,

183
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
a psychologist in England,

184
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
who showed subjects this degraded image

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
and then ran a correlation between

186
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
their scores on an ESP test:

187
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
How much did they believe in the paranormal,

188
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
supernatural, angels and so forth.

189
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,

190
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
tended to not only see

191
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
more patterns in the degraded images

192
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
but incorrect patterns.

193
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Here is what you show subjects.

194
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

195
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
and then the one I showed you,

196
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
70 percent.

197
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

198
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
named Peter Brugger,

199
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
who found significantly more meaningful patterns

200
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
were perceived on the right hemisphere,

201
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.

202
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
So if you present subjects the images such

203
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,

204
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
then they're more likely to see patterns

205
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.

206
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Our right hemisphere appears to be

207
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.

208
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain

209
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
to see where all this happens.

210
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,

211
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
gave subjects L-DOPA.

212
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,

213
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.

214
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
L-DOPA increases dopamine.

215
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
An increase of dopamine caused

216
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
subjects to see more patterns

217
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
than those that did not receive the dopamine.

218
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
So dopamine appears to be the drug

219
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
associated with patternicity.

220
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
In fact, neuroleptic drugs

221
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,

222
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
things like paranoia, delusions

223
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
and hallucinations,

224
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
these are patternicities.

225
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.

226
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
And if you give them drugs

227
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
that are dopamine antagonists,

228
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
they go away.

229
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,

230
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
and their tendency to see

231
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
patterns like that decreases.

232
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine

233
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
are dopamine agonists.

234
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
They increase the amount of dopamine.

235
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,

236
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
creativity, find more patterns.

237
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

238
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
talk about how he thought he was much funnier

239
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.

240
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
So perhaps more dopamine

241
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
is related to more creativity.

242
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Dopamine, I think, changes

243
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
our signal-to-noise ratio.

244
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
That is, how accurate we are

245
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
in finding patterns.

246
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.

247
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.

248
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.

250
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.

251
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.

252
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
You think people are talking about you.

253
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply

254
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
labeled as madness.

255
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
It's a distinction perhaps we might make

256
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman

257
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
and John Nash.

258
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
One sees maybe just the right number

259
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.

260
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.

261
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
And we then call that schizophrenia.

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.

263
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
And of course you all know exactly

264
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
what this is, right?

265
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
And what pattern do you see here?

266
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,

267
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
causing you conflicting pattern detections.

268
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.

269
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
These are sandals.

270
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.

271
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Maybe a little Photoshopped.

272
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
And of course, the ambiguous figures

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.

274
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot

275
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
influences what you

276
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
tend to see.

277
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
And you see the lamp here, I know.

278
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Because the lights on here.

279
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement

280
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.

281
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure

282
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
is, of course, the dolphins, right?

283
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
You see a dolphin here,

284
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
and there's a dolphin,

285
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
and there's a dolphin.

286
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.

287
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
(Laughter)

288
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
If we can give you conflicting data, again,

289
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.

290
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.

291
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
And then we have to flip the image

292
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
for you to see that it's a set up.

293
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
The impossible crate illusion.

294
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.

295
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that

296
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."

297
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'

298
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,

299
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
in which Jerry is standing inside

300
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
the impossible crate.

301
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
And he was kind enough to post this

302
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
and give us the reveal.

303
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,

304
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.

305
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
But even when I take it away,

306
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired

307
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
to find those certain kinds of patterns.

308
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
This is a fairly new one

309
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns

310
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
of comparing this angle with that angle.

311
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.

312
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
So what you're doing is comparing that angle

313
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
instead of with this one, but with that one.

314
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And so your brain is fooled.

315
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.

316
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Faces are easy to see

317
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
because we have an additional evolved

318
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
facial recognition software

319
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
in our temporal lobes.

320
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.

321
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.

322
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
But anyway, the point is still made.

323
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Now which one of these looks odd to you?

324
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?

325
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it

326
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
so it'll be the one on the right.

327
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
And you are correct.

328
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.

329
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.

330
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Well, why is this happening?

331
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Well, we know exactly where it happens,

332
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,

333
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

334
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
And there's two types of cells that do this,

335
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
that record facial features either globally,

336
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,

337
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
first look at the general face.

338
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
So you recognize Obama immediately.

339
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
And then you notice something quite

340
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.

341
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Especially when they're upside down,

342
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.

343
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
Now I said back in our little thought experiment,

344
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.

345
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?

346
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
What's the difference between those?

347
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Well, the wind is inanimate;

348
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.

349
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
And I call this process agenticity.

350
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
That is the tendency to infuse patterns

351
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
with meaning, intention and agency,

352
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
often invisible beings from the top down.

353
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
This is an idea that we got

354
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,

355
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
who talked about taking the intentional stance.

356
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:

357
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,

358
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
aliens, intelligent designers,

359
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
government conspiracists

360
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
and all manner of invisible agents

361
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
with power and intention, are believed

362
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
to haunt our world and control our lives.

363
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I think it's the basis of animism

364
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
and polytheism and monotheism.

365
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
It's the belief that aliens are somehow

366
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
more advanced than us, more moral than us,

367
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
and the narratives always are

368
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

369
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
The intelligent designer's always portrayed

370
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
as this super intelligent, moral being

371
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
that comes down to design life.

372
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Even the idea that government can rescue us --

373
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
that's no longer the wave of the future,

374
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:

375
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
projecting somebody up there,

376
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
big and powerful, will come rescue us.

377
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.

378
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,

379
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
whether it's the Illuminati

380
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
or the Bilderbergers.

381
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?

382
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Some patterns are real and some are not.

383
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?

384
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --

385
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.

386
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.

387
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.

388
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.

389
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
So we can't just uniformly dismiss

390
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
all patterns like that.

391
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.

392
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
Some conspiracies really are true.

393
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Explains a lot, maybe.

394
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.

395
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
We did a whole issue on it.

396
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings

397
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
constitutes a conspiracy.

398
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.

399
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.

400
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Well, that's a whole other lecture.

401
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
You know how we know that 9/11

402
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?

403
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Because it worked.

404
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
(Laughter)

405
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
(Applause)

406
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
So we are natural-born dualists.

407
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Our agenticity process comes from

408
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.

409
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Because we can imagine, in essence,

410
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
continuing on.

411
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,

412
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,

413
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
near-death experiences,

414
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.

415
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,

416
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
by accelerating in a centrifuge.

417
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.

418
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
And the brain then senses

419
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
that there's an out-of-body experience.

420
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --

421
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,

422
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.

423
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.

424
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip

425
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
that sort of brings all this together.

426
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
It's just a minute and a half.

427
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.

428
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Go ahead and roll it.

429
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions

430
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
for an advert for lip balm.

431
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this

432
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
in a national commercial, right?

433
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
And this is test on some lip balms

434
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
that we have over here.

435
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
And these are our models who are going to help us,

436
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Roger and Matt.

437
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
And we have our own lip balm,

438
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
and we have a leading brand.

439
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Would you have any problem

440
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
kissing our models to test it?

441
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Girl: No.

442
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine.

443
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.)

444
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
So this is a blind test.

445
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
I'm going to ask you to go ahead

446
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
and put a blindfold on.

447
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)

448
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)

449
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?

450
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.)

451
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test

452
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
is how it protects your lips,

453
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
the texture, right,

454
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.

455
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?)

456
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Girl: No.

457
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Woman: Take a step here.

458
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.

459
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?

460
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,820
(Music)

461
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,820
(Laughter)

462
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,820
(Laughter)

463
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Woman: Okay.

464
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

465
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Jennifer: Good.

466
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,820
(Laughter)

467
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Girl: Oh my God!

468
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,820
(Laughter)

469
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
