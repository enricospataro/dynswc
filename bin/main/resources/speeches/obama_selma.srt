1
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,689
It is a rare honor in this life to follow
one of your heroes. And John Lewis is one

2
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:47,001
of my heroes.
Now, I have to imagine that when a younger

3
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,899
John Lewis woke up that morning fifty years
ago and made his way to Brown Chapel, heroics

4
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:07,098
were not on his mind. A day like this was
not on his mind. Young folks with bedrolls

5
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:20,003
and backpacks were milling about. Veterans
of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics

6
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:28,045
of non-violence; the right way to protect
yourself when attacked. A doctor described

7
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:36,720
what tear gas does to the body, while marchers
scribbled down instructions for contacting

8
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:43,819
their loved ones. The air was thick with doubt,
anticipation, and fear. They comforted themselves

9
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:55,410
with the final verse of the final hymn they
sung:

10
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:03,229
No matter what may be the test, God will take
care of you;

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will
take care of you.

12
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:19,033
Then, his knapsack stocked with an apple,
a toothbrush, a book on government – all

13
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:29,023
you need for a night behind bars – John
Lewis led them out of the church on a mission

14
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:37,073
to change America.
President Bush and Mrs. Bush, Governor Bentley,

15
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:55,819
Members of Congress, Mayor Evans, Reverend
Strong, friends and fellow Americans:

16
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:09,025
There are places, and moments in America where
this nation’s destiny has been decided.

17
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:17,819
Many are sites of war – Concord and Lexington,
Appomattox and Gettysburg. Others are sites

18
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:27,006
that symbolize the daring of America’s character
– Independence Hall and Seneca Falls, Kitty

19
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:36,066
Hawk and Cape Canaveral.
Selma is such a place.

20
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:46,002
In one afternoon fifty years ago, so much
of our turbulent history – the stain of

21
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:55,074
slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke
of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the

22
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:05,086
death of four little girls in Birmingham,
and the dream of a Baptist preacher – met

23
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:14,239
on this bridge.
It was not a clash of armies, but a clash

24
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:21,091
of wills; a contest to determine the meaning
of America.

25
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:31,046
And because of men and women like John Lewis,
Joseph Lowery, Hosea Williams, Amelia Boynton,

26
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:44,021
Diane Nash, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. Vivian,
Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. King,

27
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:53,083
and so many more, the idea of a just America,
a fair America, an inclusive America, a generous

28
00:04:57,016 --> 00:05:04,016
America – that idea ultimately triumphed.
As is true across the landscape of American

29
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:15,038
history, we cannot examine this moment in
isolation. The march on Selma was part of

30
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:22,055
a broader campaign that spanned generations;
the leaders that day part of a long line of

31
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:29,085
heroes.
We gather here to celebrate them. We gather

32
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:37,097
here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans
willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening

33
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:43,138
rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men
and women who despite the gush of blood and

34
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:50,063
splintered bone would stay true to their North
Star and keep marching toward justice.

35
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:57,063
They did as Scripture instructed: “Rejoice
in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant

36
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:09,699
in prayer.” And in the days to come, they
went back again and again. When the trumpet

37
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:19,058
call sounded for more to join, the people
came – black and white, young and old, Christian

38
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:28,046
and Jew, waving the American flag and singing
the same anthems full of faith and hope. A

39
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:37,096
white newsman, Bill Plante, who covered the
marches then and who is with us here today,

40
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:45,099
quipped that the growing number of white people
lowered the quality of the singing. To those

41
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:54,057
who marched, though, those old gospel songs
must have never sounded so sweet.

42
00:06:54,057 --> 00:07:01,057
In time, their chorus would reach President
Johnson. And he would send them protection,

43
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,052
echoing their call for the nation and the
world to hear:

44
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:21,052
“We shall overcome.”
What enormous faith these men and women had.

45
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:35,035
Faith in God – but also faith in America.
The Americans who crossed this bridge were

46
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:43,059
not physically imposing. But they gave courage
to millions. They held no elected office.

47
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:53,039
But they led a nation. They marched as Americans
who had endured hundreds of years of brutal

48
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:59,250
violence, and countless daily indignities
– but they didn’t seek special treatment,

49
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:06,889
just the equal treatment promised to them
almost a century before.

50
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:15,102
What they did here will reverberate through
the ages. Not because the change they won

51
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:23,002
was preordained; not because their victory
was complete; but because they proved that

52
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:33,055
nonviolent change is possible; that love and
hope can conquer hate.

53
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,861
As we commemorate their achievement, we are
well-served to remember that at the time of

54
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:50,509
the marches, many in power condemned rather
than praised them. Back then, they were called

55
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,959
Communists, half-breeds, outside agitators,
sexual and moral degenerates, and worse – everything

56
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:09,055
but the name their parents gave them. Their
faith was questioned. Their lives were threatened.

57
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:19,032
Their patriotism was challenged.
And yet, what could be more American than

58
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:26,066
what happened in this place?
What could more profoundly vindicate the idea

59
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:37,041
of America than plain and humble people – the
unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not

60
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:46,025
of high station, not born to wealth or privilege,
not of one religious tradition but many – coming

61
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:53,037
together to shape their country’s course?
What greater expression of faith in the American

62
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:59,073
experiment than this; what greater form of
patriotism is there; than the belief that

63
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:07,018
America is not yet finished, that we are strong
enough to be self-critical, that each successive

64
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:12,064
generation can look upon our imperfections
and decide that it is in our power to remake

65
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:18,079
this nation to more closely align with our
highest ideals?

66
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,079
That’s why Selma is not some outlier in
the American experience. That’s why it’s

67
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:37,054
not a museum or static monument to behold
from a distance. It is instead the manifestation

68
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:45,031
of a creed written into our founding documents:
“We the People…in order to form a more

69
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:51,086
perfect union.”
“We hold these truths to be self-evident,

70
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:58,086
that all men are created equal.”
These are not just words. They are a living

71
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
thing, a call to action, a roadmap for citizenship
and an insistence in the capacity of free

72
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:16,049
men and women to shape our own destiny. For
founders like Franklin and Jefferson, for

73
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:22,076
leaders like Lincoln and FDR, the success
of our experiment in self-government rested

74
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:28,084
on engaging all our citizens in this work.
That’s what we celebrate here in Selma.

75
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:36,056
That’s what this movement was all about,
one leg in our long journey toward freedom.

76
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:46,083
The American instinct that led these young
men and women to pick up the torch and cross

77
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,660
this bridge is the same instinct that moved
patriots to choose revolution over tyranny.

78
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:58,161
It’s the same instinct that drew immigrants
from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the

79
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:03,110
same instinct that led women to reach for
the ballot and workers to organize against

80
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:10,046
an unjust status quo; the same instinct that
led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on

81
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:17,055
the surface of the Moon.
It’s the idea held by generations of citizens

82
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:22,397
who believed that America is a constant work
in progress; who believed that loving this

83
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,100
country requires more than singing its praises
or avoiding uncomfortable truths. It requires

84
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:35,007
the occasional disruption, the willingness
to speak out for what’s right and shake

85
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:42,007
up the status quo.
That’s what makes us unique, and cements

86
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:55,060
our reputation as a beacon of opportunity.
Young people behind the Iron Curtain would

87
00:12:55,006 --> 00:13:01,037
see Selma and eventually tear down a wall.
Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy

88
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:07,520
talk about ripples of hope and eventually
banish the scourge of apartheid. Young people

89
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:15,339
in Burma went to prison rather than submit
to military rule. From the streets of Tunis

90
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,540
to the Maidan in Ukraine, this generation
of young people can draw strength from this

91
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:29,061
place, where the powerless could change the
world’s greatest superpower, and push their

92
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:37,024
leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom.
They saw that idea made real in Selma, Alabama.

93
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:46,054
They saw it made real in America.
Because of campaigns like this, a Voting Rights

94
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:57,074
Act was passed. Political, economic, and social
barriers came down, and the change these men

95
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,680
and women wrought is visible here today in
the presence of African-Americans who run

96
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:08,087
boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve
in elected office from small towns to big

97
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:15,087
cities; from the Congressional Black Caucus
to the Oval Office.

98
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:23,093
Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity
swung open not just for African-Americans,

99
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:30,106
but for every American. Women marched through
those doors. Latinos marched through those

100
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:37,091
doors. Asian-Americans, gay Americans, and
Americans with disabilities came through those

101
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:44,091
doors. Their endeavors gave the entire South
the chance to rise again, not by reasserting

102
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:57,076
the past, but by transcending the past.
What a glorious thing, Dr. King might say.

103
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:06,094
What a solemn debt we owe.
Which leads us to ask, just how might we repay

104
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:13,142
that debt?
First and foremost, we have to recognize that

105
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:21,042
one day’s commemoration, no matter how special,
is not enough. If Selma taught us anything,

106
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:31,044
it’s that our work is never done – the
American experiment in self-government gives

107
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:38,067
work and purpose to each generation.
Selma teaches us, too, that action requires

108
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:47,057
that we shed our cynicism. For when it comes
to the pursuit of justice, we can afford neither

109
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:55,529
complacency nor despair.
Just this week, I was asked whether I thought

110
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:59,907
the Department of Justice’s Ferguson report
shows that, with respect to race, little has

111
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:07,519
changed in this country. I understand the
question, for the report’s narrative was

112
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,519
woefully familiar. It evoked the kind of abuse
and disregard for citizens that spawned the

113
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:23,008
Civil Rights Movement. But I rejected the
notion that nothing’s changed. What happened

114
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:30,670
in Ferguson may not be unique, but it’s
no longer endemic, or sanctioned by law and

115
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:36,074
custom; and before the Civil Rights Movement,
it most surely was.

116
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:41,141
We do a disservice to the cause of justice
by intimating that bias and discrimination

117
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:48,113
are immutable, or that racial division is
inherent to America. If you think nothing’s

118
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:53,081
changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody
who lived through the Selma or Chicago or

119
00:16:53,081 --> 00:17:00,081
L.A. of the Fifties. Ask the female CEO who
once might have been assigned to the secretarial

120
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:08,075
pool if nothing’s changed. Ask your gay
friend if it’s easier to be out and proud

121
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:15,309
in America now than it was thirty years ago.
To deny this progress – our progress – would

122
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:26,085
be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility
to do what we can to make America better.

123
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:37,097
Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest
that racism is banished, that the work that

124
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:46,256
drew men and women to Selma is complete, and
that whatever racial tensions remain are a

125
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:53,679
consequence of those seeking to play the “race
card” for their own purposes. We don’t

126
00:17:54,009 --> 00:18:00,330
need the Ferguson report to know that’s
not true. We just need to open our eyes, and

127
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:04,722
ears, and hearts, to know that this nation’s
racial history still casts its long shadow

128
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:12,019
upon us. We know the march is not yet over,
the race is not yet won, and that reaching

129
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:23,092
that blessed destination where we are judged
by the content of our character – requires

130
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:30,389
admitting as much.
“We are capable of bearing a great burden,”

131
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:40,006
James Baldwin wrote, “once we discover that
the burden is reality and arrive where reality

132
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,919
is.”
This is work for all Americans, and not just

133
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:01,779
some. Not just whites. Not just blacks. If
we want to honor the courage of those who

134
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:08,690
marched that day, then all of us are called
to possess their moral imagination. All of

135
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:14,028
us will need to feel, as they did, the fierce
urgency of now. All of us need to recognize,

136
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:21,649
as they did, that change depends on our actions,
our attitudes, the things we teach our children.

137
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:30,109
And if we make such effort, no matter how
hard it may seem, laws can be passed, and

138
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:41,229
consciences can be stirred, and consensus
can be built.

139
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:47,232
With such effort, we can make sure our criminal
justice system serves all and not just some.

140
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,284
Together, we can raise the level of mutual
trust that policing is built on – the idea

141
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:57,522
that police officers are members of the communities
they risk their lives to protect, and citizens

142
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:01,460
in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland just
want the same thing young people here marched

143
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:08,046
for – the protection of the law. Together,
we can address unfair sentencing, and overcrowded

144
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:18,873
prisons, and the stunted circumstances that
rob too many boys of the chance to become

145
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:26,629
men, and rob the nation of too many men who
could be good dads, and workers, and neighbors.

146
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:37,108
With effort, we can roll back poverty and
the roadblocks to opportunity. Americans don’t

147
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:44,607
accept a free ride for anyone, nor do we believe
in equality of outcomes. But we do expect

148
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:51,679
equal opportunity, and if we really mean it,
if we’re willing to sacrifice for it, then

149
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:58,456
we can make sure every child gets an education
suitable to this new century, one that expands

150
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:05,879
imaginations and lifts their sights and gives
them skills. We can make sure every person

151
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,434
willing to work has the dignity of a job,
and a fair wage, and a real voice, and sturdier

152
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:19,109
rungs on that ladder into the middle class.
And with effort, we can protect the foundation

153
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:26,326
stone of our democracy for which so many marched
across this bridge – and that is the right

154
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:34,109
to vote. Right now, in 2015, fifty years after
Selma, there are laws across this country

155
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:51,529
designed to make it harder for people to vote.
As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed.

156
00:21:53,058 --> 00:22:00,058
Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination
of so much blood and sweat and tears, the

157
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:08,669
product of so much sacrifice in the face of
wanton violence, stands weakened, its future

158
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:17,082
subject to partisan rancor.
How can that be? The Voting Rights Act was

159
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:27,419
one of the crowning achievements of our democracy,
the result of Republican and Democratic effort.

160
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:34,840
President Reagan signed its renewal when he
was in office. President Bush signed its renewal

161
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:39,103
when he was in office. One hundred Members
of Congress have come here today to honor

162
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,958
people who were willing to die for the right
it protects. If we want to honor this day,

163
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:50,925
let these hundred go back to Washington, and
gather four hundred more, and together, pledge

164
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:58,609
to make it their mission to restore the law
this year.

165
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:16,022
Of course, our democracy is not the task of
Congress alone, or the courts alone, or the

166
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:24,149
President alone. If every new voter suppression
law was struck down today, we’d still have

167
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:35,239
one of the lowest voting rates among free
peoples. Fifty years ago, registering to vote

168
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:40,560
here in Selma and much of the South meant
guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar

169
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:47,090
or bubbles on a bar of soap. It meant risking
your dignity, and sometimes, your life. What

170
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:54,009
is our excuse today for not voting? How do
we so casually discard the right for which

171
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:03,909
so many fought? How do we so fully give away
our power, our voice, in shaping America’s

172
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:16,269
future?
Fellow marchers, so much has changed in fifty

173
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:33,789
years. We’ve endured war, and fashioned
peace. We’ve seen technological wonders

174
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:41,953
that touch every aspect of our lives, and
take for granted convenience our parents might

175
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:49,169
scarcely imagine. But what has not changed
is the imperative of citizenship, that willingness

176
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:59,249
of a 26 year-old deacon, or a Unitarian minister,
or a young mother of five, to decide they

177
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:06,499
loved this country so much that they’d risk
everything to realize its promise.

178
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:13,789
That’s what it means to love America. That’s
what it means to believe in America. That’s

179
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:22,549
what it means when we say America is exceptional.
For we were born of change. We broke the old

180
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:29,503
aristocracies, declaring ourselves entitled
not by bloodline, but endowed by our Creator

181
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:36,899
with certain unalienable rights. We secure
our rights and responsibilities through a

182
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:44,049
system of self-government, of and by and for
the people. That’s why we argue and fight

183
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:50,134
with so much passion and conviction, because
we know our efforts matter. We know America

184
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:57,359
is what we make of it.
We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea – pioneers

185
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:08,529
who braved the unfamiliar, followed by a stampede
of farmers and miners, entrepreneurs and hucksters.

186
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:16,084
That’s our spirit.
We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer,

187
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,432
women who could do as much as any man and
then some; and we’re Susan B. Anthony, who

188
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,651
shook the system until the law reflected that
truth. That’s our character.

189
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,851
We’re the immigrants who stowed away on
ships to reach these shores, the huddled masses

190
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,679
yearning to breathe free – Holocaust survivors,
Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys of Sudan.

191
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:48,539
We are the hopeful strivers who cross the
Rio Grande because they want their kids to

192
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,046
know a better life. That’s how we came to
be.

193
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:59,318
We’re the slaves who built the White House
and the economy of the South. We’re the

194
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:04,465
ranch hands and cowboys who opened the West,
and countless laborers who laid rail, and

195
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:09,070
raised skyscrapers, and organized for workers’
rights.

196
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:16,169
We’re the fresh-faced GIs who fought to
liberate a continent, and we’re the Tuskeegee

197
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:22,348
Airmen, Navajo code-talkers, and Japanese-Americans
who fought for this country even as their

198
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:29,879
own liberty had been denied. We’re the firefighters
who rushed into those buildings on 9/11, and

199
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:35,600
the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan
and Iraq.

200
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,820
We are the gay Americans whose blood ran on
the streets of San Francisco and New York,

201
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:47,138
just as blood ran down this bridge.
We are storytellers, writers, poets, and artists

202
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:53,566
who abhor unfairness, and despise hypocrisy,
and give voice to the voiceless, and tell

203
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:00,830
truths that need to be told.
We are the inventors of gospel and jazz and

204
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:05,982
the blues, bluegrass and country, hip-hop
and rock and roll, our very own sounds with

205
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:13,729
all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom.
We are Jackie Robinson, enduring scorn and

206
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,960
spiked cleats and pitches coming straight
to his head, and stealing home in the World

207
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:25,096
Series anyway.
We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of,

208
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:32,107
who “build our temples for tomorrow, strong
as we know how.”

209
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:38,286
We are the people Emerson wrote of, “who
for truth and honor’s sake stand fast and

210
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,460
suffer long;” who are “never tired, so
long as we can see far enough.”

211
00:28:42,046 --> 00:28:49,046
That’s what America is. Not stock photos
or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to

212
00:28:53,045 --> 00:29:00,045
define some of us as more American as others.
We respect the past, but we don’t pine for

213
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:14,109
it. We don’t fear the future; we grab for
it. America is not some fragile thing; we

214
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:24,700
are large, in the words of Whitman, containing
multitudes. We are boisterous and diverse

215
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:29,936
and full of energy, perpetually young in spirit.
That’s why someone like John Lewis at the

216
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:37,629
ripe age of 25 could lead a mighty march.
And that’s what the young people here today

217
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:45,499
and listening all across the country must
take away from this day. You are America.

218
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:55,739
Unconstrained by habits and convention. Unencumbered
by what is, and ready to seize what ought

219
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:03,859
to be. For everywhere in this country, there
are first steps to be taken, and new ground

220
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:12,299
to cover, and bridges to be crossed. And it
is you, the young and fearless at heart, the

221
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:22,139
most diverse and educated generation in our
history, who the nation is waiting to follow.

222
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:30,033
Because Selma shows us that America is not
the project of any one person.

223
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:37,529
Because the single most powerful word in our
democracy is the word “We.” We The People.

224
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:47,859
We Shall Overcome. Yes We Can. It is owned
by no one. It belongs to everyone. Oh, what

225
00:30:53,219 --> 00:31:00,219
a glorious task we are given, to continually
try to improve this great nation of ours.

226
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:10,976
Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march
is not yet finished. But we are getting closer.

227
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,133
Two hundred and thirty-nine years after this
nation’s founding, our union is not yet

228
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:22,053
perfect. But we are getting closer. Our job’s
easier because somebody already got us through

229
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:29,719
that first mile. Somebody already got us over
that bridge. When it feels the road’s too

230
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:37,007
hard, when the torch we’ve been passed feels
too heavy, we will remember these early travelers,

231
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:42,261
and draw strength from their example, and
hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah:

232
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:48,624
“Those who hope in the Lord will renew their
strength. They will soar on wings like eagles.

233
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:54,299
They will run and not grow weary. They will
walk and not be faint.”

234
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:01,299
We honor those who walked so we could run.
We must run so our children soar. And we will

235
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:07,107
not grow weary. For we believe in the power
of an awesome God, and we believe in this

236
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:11,940
country’s sacred promise.
May He bless those warriors of justice no

237
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:14,098
longer with us, and bless the United States
of America.
