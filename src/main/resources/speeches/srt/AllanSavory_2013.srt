1
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:16,877
The most massive

2
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:21,812
tsunami perfect storm

3
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:25,691
is bearing down upon us.

4
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,937
This perfect storm

5
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:34,105
is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,

6
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:39,055
and we are facing that reality

7
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:40,436
with the full belief

8
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:42,992
that we can solve our problems with technology,

9
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,288
and that's very understandable.

10
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:49,495
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing

11
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:53,005
is the result of our rising population,

12
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,809
rising towards 10 billion people,

13
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,453
land that is turning to desert,

14
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:01,561
and, of course, climate change.

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,222
Now there's no question about it at all:

16
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:06,033
we will only solve the problem

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,545
of replacing fossil fuels with technology.

18
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,673
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,794
are by no means the only thing

20
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:18,912
that is causing climate change.

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,795
Desertification

22
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:26,121
is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,

23
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,422
and this happens only when

24
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,431
we create too much bare ground.

25
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,437
There's no other cause.

26
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,455
And I intend to focus

27
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:39,361
on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.

28
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,654
But I have for you a very simple message

29
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:48,850
that offers more hope than you can imagine.

30
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,918
We have environments

31
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:54,162
where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.

32
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:56,666
On those, it is almost impossible

33
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,455
to create vast areas of bare ground.

34
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:03,077
No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.

35
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:04,824
And we have environments

36
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,517
where we have months of humidity

37
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,295
followed by months of dryness,

38
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,773
and that is where desertification is occurring.

39
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,829
Fortunately, with space technology now,

40
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,506
we can look at it from space,

41
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:20,770
and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,393
Generally, what you see in green

43
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,248
is not desertifying,

44
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:26,554
and what you see in brown is,

45
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,926
and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.

46
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:35,711
About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.

47
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:38,635
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert

48
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:42,339
while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.

49
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,051
Think of it in terms of drums of water,

50
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:47,723
each containing 200 liters.

51
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:52,323
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare

52
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:55,197
of that land that day.

53
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,581
The next day, the land looked like this.

54
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,404
Where had that water gone?

55
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,801
Some of it ran off as flooding,

56
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,748
but most of the water that soaked into the soil

57
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,029
simply evaporated out again,

58
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,398
exactly as it does in your garden

59
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,413
if you leave the soil uncovered.

60
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:16,879
Now, because the fate of water and carbon

61
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,437
are tied to soil organic matter,

62
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:24,364
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.

63
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:27,190
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,295
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,

65
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,295
that desertification is only occurring

66
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,944
in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,

67
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,919
and that tall grasslands like this one

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,551
in high rainfall are of no consequence.

69
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:50,128
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,

70
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,839
you find that most of the soil in that grassland

71
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:57,130
that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,

72
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,248
leading to increased runoff and evaporation.

73
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:04,234
That is the cancer of desertification

74
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:08,770
that we do not recognize till its terminal form.

75
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,082
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,

76
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:16,866
mostly cattle, sheep and goats,

77
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,683
overgrazing the plants,

78
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:23,802
leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.

79
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,042
Almost everybody knows this,

80
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,877
from nobel laureates to golf caddies,

81
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,508
or was taught it, as I was.

82
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:34,978
Now, the environments like you see here,

83
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,842
dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,

84
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:40,762
and I loved wildlife,

85
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:44,154
and so I grew up hating livestock

86
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:46,182
because of the damage they were doing.

87
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,466
And then my university education as an ecologist

88
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,554
reinforced my beliefs.

89
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:57,830
Well, I have news for you.

90
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,114
We were once just as certain

91
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,394
that the world was flat.

92
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:07,339
We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.

93
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,514
And I want to invite you now

94
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:15,768
to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.

95
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:18,339
When I was a young man,

96
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,234
a young biologist in Africa,

97
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:25,651
I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas

98
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,170
as future national parks.

99
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,597
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —

100
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,765
and no sooner did we remove the hunting,

101
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:38,246
drum-beating people to protect the animals,

102
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,139
than the land began to deteriorate,

103
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,385
as you see in this park that we formed.

104
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,708
Now, no livestock were involved,

105
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,340
but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,

106
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,605
I did the research and I proved we had too many,

107
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:58,189
and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers

108
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:02,241
and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.

109
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,025
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,

110
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,884
and it was political dynamite, frankly.

111
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:12,009
So our government formed a team of experts

112
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,650
to evaluate my research.

113
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,057
They did. They agreed with me,

114
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,968
and over the following years,

115
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:24,859
we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.

116
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:28,599
And it got worse, not better.

117
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,098
Loving elephants as I do,

118
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,704
that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,

119
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:37,432
and I will carry that to my grave.

120
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:39,904
One good thing did come out of it.

121
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:43,280
It made me absolutely determined

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,760
to devote my life to finding solutions.

123
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,845
When I came to the United States, I got a shock,

124
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,313
to find national parks like this one

125
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:59,544
desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.

126
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,548
And there'd been no livestock on this land

127
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:04,272
for over 70 years.

128
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,198
And I found that American scientists

129
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,112
had no explanation for this

130
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:12,072
except that it is arid and natural.

131
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:15,432
So I then began looking

132
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:18,683
at all the research plots I could

133
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:21,386
over the whole of the Western United States

134
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:23,587
where cattle had been removed

135
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:26,459
to prove that it would stop desertification,

136
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,292
but I found the opposite,

137
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,114
as we see on this research station,

138
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:34,838
where this grassland that was green in 1961,

139
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:39,851
by 2002 had changed to that situation.

140
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:44,570
And the authors of the position paper on climate change

141
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,123
from which I obtained these pictures

142
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:52,942
attribute this change to "unknown processes."

143
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:56,936
Clearly, we have never understood

144
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:59,620
what is causing desertification,

145
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,668
which has destroyed many civilizations

146
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:05,360
and now threatens us globally.

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,813
We have never understood it.

148
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,932
Take one square meter of soil

149
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:12,635
and make it bare like this is down here,

150
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,814
and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn

151
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:18,618
and much hotter at midday

152
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:22,288
than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,

153
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,902
plant litter.

154
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,939
You have changed the microclimate.

155
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,038
Now, by the time you are doing that

156
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,626
and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground

157
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:38,651
on more than half the world's land,

158
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,881
you are changing macroclimate.

159
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,470
But we have just simply not understood

160
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,456
why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?

161
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:51,106
Why has it accelerated lately?

162
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:53,073
We had no understanding of that.

163
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,498
What we had failed to understand

164
00:08:56,498 --> 00:09:00,321
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,

165
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:03,217
the soil and the vegetation

166
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:09,009
developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,

167
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,633
and that these grazing animals

168
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:17,025
developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.

169
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:20,917
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators

170
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,258
is to get into herds,

171
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:27,250
and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.

172
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,081
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,

173
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:35,081
and they have to keep moving,

174
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,998
and it was that movement

175
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,802
that prevented the overgrazing of plants,

176
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:42,201
while the periodic trampling

177
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,721
ensured good cover of the soil,

178
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:47,833
as we see where a herd has passed.

179
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:54,061
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.

180
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,853
It has just come through four months of rain,

181
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:00,535
and it's now going into eight months of dry season.

182
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:04,003
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.

183
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,079
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground

184
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,827
has to decay biologically

185
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,351
before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,

186
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:18,544
the grassland and the soil begin to die.

187
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:21,739
Now, if it does not decay biologically,

188
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:26,878
it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,

189
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,833
and this smothers and kills grasses,

190
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,942
leading to a shift to woody vegetation

191
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:36,362
and bare soil, releasing carbon.

192
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:41,466
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.

193
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:47,315
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,

194
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,706
and worse than that,

195
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,386
burning one hectare of grassland

196
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,546
gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants

197
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:58,460
than 6,000 cars.

198
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,853
And we are burning in Africa, every single year,

199
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:07,492
more than one billion hectares of grasslands,

200
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:11,118
and almost nobody is talking about it.

201
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:15,457
We justify the burning, as scientists,

202
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:18,370
because it does remove the dead material

203
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,673
and it allows the plants to grow.

204
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,769
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,

205
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,465
what could we do to keep that healthy?

206
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:30,489
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.

207
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:35,177
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more

208
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,793
without causing desertification and climate change.

209
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,930
We cannot burn it without causing

210
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,195
desertification and climate change.

211
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:48,180
What are we going to do?

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,630
There is only one option,

213
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,491
I'll repeat to you, only one option

214
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:58,210
left to climatologists and scientists,

215
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,138
and that is to do the unthinkable,

216
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,874
and to use livestock,

217
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:06,829
bunched and moving,

218
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,218
as a proxy for former herds and predators,

219
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:11,962
and mimic nature.

220
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:16,466
There is no other alternative left to mankind.

221
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:18,914
So let's do that.

222
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:22,284
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.

223
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,522
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,

224
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:28,346
and we've done so, and look at that.

225
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,706
All of that grass is now covering the soil

226
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:35,676
as dung, urine and litter or mulch,

227
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,956
as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,

228
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:43,317
and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,

229
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:48,324
to store carbon, and to break down methane.

230
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,554
And we did that,

231
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:53,324
without using fire to damage the soil,

232
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:56,460
and the plants are free to grow.

233
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,724
When I first realized

234
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:01,206
that we had no option as scientists

235
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,966
but to use much-vilified livestock

236
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:09,213
to address climate change and desertification,

237
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:11,448
I was faced with a real dilemma.

238
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,173
How were we to do it?

239
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:17,737
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists

240
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,685
bunching and moving their animals,

241
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,352
but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.

242
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:27,231
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,

243
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:30,490
and that had accelerated desertification,

244
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,663
as we first discovered in Africa

245
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:35,327
and then confirmed in the United States,

246
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,446
and as you see in this picture

247
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:40,807
of land managed by the federal government.

248
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,708
Clearly more was needed

249
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,797
than bunching and moving the animals,

250
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:48,367
and humans, over thousands of years,

251
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:52,753
had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.

252
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:55,137
But we biologists and ecologists

253
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:58,106
had never tackled anything as complex as this.

254
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,745
So rather than reinvent the wheel,

255
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:04,881
I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.

256
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,353
And I found there were planning techniques

257
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:11,125
that I could take and adapt to our biological need,

258
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,822
and from those I developed what we call

259
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:17,132
holistic management and planned grazing,

260
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,931
a planning process,

261
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:22,626
and that does address all of nature's complexity

262
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:27,875
and our social, environmental, economic complexity.

263
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,539
Today, we have young women like this one

264
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,907
teaching villages in Africa

265
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,843
how to put their animals together into larger herds,

266
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:38,547
plan their grazing to mimic nature,

267
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:42,588
and where we have them hold their animals overnight --

268
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:44,847
we run them in a predator-friendly manner,

269
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,169
because we have a lot of lands, and so on --

270
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,363
and where they do this and hold them overnight

271
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:51,168
to prepare the crop fields,

272
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:55,152
we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.

273
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,769
Let's look at some results.

274
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,993
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.

275
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:04,537
It has just come through four months of very good rains

276
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,047
it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.

277
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,082
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,

278
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,189
has evaporated from the soil surface.

279
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:17,991
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,

280
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,511
and we have 150,000 people

281
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:25,261
on almost permanent food aid.

282
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:29,757
Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,

283
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:32,597
with the same rainfall, and look at that.

284
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,302
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.

285
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,789
It's fine.

286
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:43,107
The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,

287
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:45,963
everything is now more productive,

288
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:50,068
and we have virtually no fear of dry years.

289
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:55,563
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats

290
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,488
400 percent,

291
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,618
planning the grazing to mimic nature

292
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,039
and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,

293
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,626
giraffe and other animals that we have.

294
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:12,348
But before we began, our land looked like that.

295
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:17,765
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years

296
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:20,534
regardless of what rain we got.

297
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:24,152
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change

298
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:27,805
as we use livestock to mimic nature.

299
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,267
This was another site

300
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:31,645
where it had been bare and eroding,

301
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:34,349
and at the base of the marked small tree,

302
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:38,637
we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?

303
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,246
And again, watch the change

304
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:43,096
just using livestock to mimic nature.

305
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,227
And there are fallen trees in there now,

306
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:50,184
because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.

307
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:53,840
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,

308
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,794
and I've had to mark the hill

309
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:59,981
because the change is so profound.

310
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:05,706
(Applause)

311
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:12,478
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s

312
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,446
turn the desert that you see on the right there

313
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,380
back to grassland,

314
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,902
and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land

315
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:22,745
with hope for the future.

316
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:25,542
And look at the amazing change in this one,

317
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,254
where that gully has completely healed

318
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:32,833
using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,

319
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:37,058
and once more, we have the third generation of that family

320
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:40,338
on that land with their flag still flying.

321
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:42,906
The vast grasslands of Patagonia

322
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,982
are turning to desert as you see here.

323
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,042
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,

324
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,686
and he has documented the steady decline of that land

325
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:55,162
over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.

326
00:17:55,162 --> 00:18:00,010
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,

327
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,959
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,

328
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:08,302
and they have documented a 50-percent increase

329
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:11,770
in the production of the land in the first year.

330
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,810
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa

331
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,266
pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature

332
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:21,762
and openly saying it is the only hope they have

333
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:24,930
of saving their families and saving their culture.

334
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,006
Ninety-five percent of that land

335
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:30,666
can only feed people from animals.

336
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,777
I remind you that I am talking about

337
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:37,218
most of the world's land here that controls our fate,

338
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:40,274
including the most violent region of the world,

339
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,226
where only animals can feed people

340
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:46,530
from about 95 percent of the land.

341
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,664
What we are doing globally is causing climate change

342
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,960
as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,

343
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,496
and maybe more than fossil fuels.

344
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:02,171
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,

345
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,168
violence, social breakdown and war,

346
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:07,576
and as I am talking to you,

347
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:10,726
millions of men, women and children

348
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:13,128
are suffering and dying.

349
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,840
And if this continues,

350
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,634
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,

351
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:24,681
even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.

352
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:28,917
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature

353
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,373
at very low cost

354
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,869
to reverse all this.

355
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,301
We are already doing so

356
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,297
on about 15 million hectares

357
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:42,929
on five continents,

358
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,556
and people who understand

359
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,846
far more about carbon than I do

360
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,904
calculate that, for illustrative purposes,

361
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:52,698
if we do what I am showing you here,

362
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:56,723
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere

363
00:19:56,723 --> 00:20:00,057
and safely store it in the grassland soils

364
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,683
for thousands of years,

365
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:06,679
and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands

366
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,033
that I've shown you,

367
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:11,733
we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,

368
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,374
while feeding people.

369
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,146
I can think of almost nothing

370
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,671
that offers more hope for our planet,

371
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,919
for your children,

372
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,575
and their children, and all of humanity.

373
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,880
Thank you.

374
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,992
(Applause)

375
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:40,980
Thank you. (Applause)

376
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,061
Thank you, Chris.

377
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:54,407
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,

378
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:56,504
and I'm sure everyone here has,

379
00:20:56,504 --> 00:21:00,232
A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.

380
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:01,991
I'm just going to ask you one quick question.

381
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,675
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,

382
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:09,051
it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?

383
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,042
How do you start?

384
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,681
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,

385
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:15,299
and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed

386
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,068
is during mine reclamation,

387
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,382
where it's 100 percent bare.

388
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:23,738
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,

389
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:26,832
where I offered a £5 note

390
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,851
in a hundred-mile drive

391
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,971
if somebody could find one grass

392
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,961
in a hundred-mile drive,

393
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,747
and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,

394
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:39,523
the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,

395
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:42,179
just by the movement, mimicking nature,

396
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,954
and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.

397
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:49,425
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.

398
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:53,137
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.

399
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,129
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you

400
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,761
and try and -- I want to get more on this

401
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:00,713
that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.

402
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:04,249
CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,

403
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:07,025
and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.

404
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,017
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

405
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,247
(Applause)
