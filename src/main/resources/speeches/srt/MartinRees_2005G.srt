1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,820
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,820
their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,820
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,820
(Laughter)

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,820
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,820
and then as a worried member of the human race.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,820
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,820
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
And let me just run through a few slides.

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
than what actually happened last Monday.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
So that's another project for NASA.

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,820
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
This artist's impression turned into reality

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,820
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,820
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,820
That looks like a coastline.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,820
the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
If we go beyond our solar system,

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,820
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
And we can see places where stars are forming,

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
leaving remnants like that.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,820
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And to the cosmologist,

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,820
these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
This picture shows a patch of sky

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
to cover the full moon in the sky.

39
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
which looks so small and faint because its light

43
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.

44
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,820
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time

46
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,820
for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
the building blocks of planets and of life.

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,820
a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
turn into our complex cosmos?

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm going to show you a movie simulation

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
16 powers of 10 faster than real time,

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,820
which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.

54
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,820
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
And we'll end up after 13 billion years

58
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,820
with something looking rather like our own universe.

59
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
And we compare simulated universes like that --

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk --

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
with what we actually see in the sky.

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,820
but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,820
an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left --

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
the world of the quantum -- and on the right

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,820
the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
We know our universes are united though --

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
links between left and right.

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
The everyday world is determined by atoms,

72
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
how they stick together to make molecules.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together

75
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,820
particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.

77
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,820
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.

78
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.

79
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.

80
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science

81
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
is to link together cosmos and micro-world

82
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically

83
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
at the top of that picture. (Laughter)

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
And until we have that synthesis,

85
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe

86
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,

87
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
quantum effects could shake everything.

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,820
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,

89
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
which we don't yet have.

90
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
One idea, incidentally --

91
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --

92
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
is that our Big Bang was not the only one.

93
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,820
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.

96
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
You can imagine ants on one of them

97
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,

98
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
not being aware of another population of ants on the other.

99
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,

100
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
but we're not aware of it because that millimeter

101
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,

102
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
and we're imprisoned in our three.

103
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality

104
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
than what we've normally called our universe --

105
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Bottom right depicts our universe,

107
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
which on the horizon is not beyond that,

108
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,820
but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.

109
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing

110
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,820
in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,

111
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
one galaxy to many galaxies,

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,820
we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,

113
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying

114
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
an immense variety of properties.

115
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Well, let's go back to this picture.

116
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
There's one challenge symbolized at the top,

117
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,820
but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.

118
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
but we want to understand the very complex.

120
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And the most complex things are ourselves,

121
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
midway between atoms and stars.

122
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.

123
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,820
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.

124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,

125
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
to have layer upon layer of complex structure.

126
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --

127
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.

128
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun

129
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
as there are atoms in each of us.

130
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton

131
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,

132
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.

133
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Well, most of you anyway.

134
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,820
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,

135
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
greater than that of the very small on the left

136
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
and the very large on the right.

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And it's this science,

138
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,820
which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,

139
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
but also transforming our world faster than ever.

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.

141
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,820
And I now move on to the second part of my talk,

142
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,820
and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.

143
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,820
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,

144
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
and I would add that it's available in paperback.

145
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
(Laughter)

146
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
And in America it was called "Our Final Hour"

147
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
because Americans like instant gratification.

148
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
(Laughter)

149
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
But my theme is that in this century,

150
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
not only has science changed the world faster than ever,

151
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
but in new and different ways.

152
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,

153
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
perhaps even implants into our brains,

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
may change human beings themselves. And human beings,

155
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,820
their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.

156
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
It may change this century.

157
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
It's new in our history.

158
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,

159
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.

160
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.

161
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign

162
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
in that they offer marvelous prospects,

163
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.

164
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
But they will have a dark side.

165
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,820
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower

166
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
just one fanatic,

167
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,820
or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,

168
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
to trigger some kind on disaster.

169
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --

170
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
error rather than terror.

171
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,820
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable

172
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
when the downside could be of global consequence.

173
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.

175
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
I don't go along with all that,

176
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.

177
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."

178
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science

179
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,820
and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.

180
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences

181
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
as well as dangerous ones.

182
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,

183
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,820
he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.

184
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,820
if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.

186
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
We have to accept that there will be hazards.

187
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,820
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,

188
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists

189
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,

190
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could

191
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
to alert the world to the dangers.

192
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein,

193
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,

194
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
the icon of poster and t-shirt,

195
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,820
who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.

196
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
He was premature. But he was a moral compass --

197
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.

198
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And perhaps the greatest living person

199
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.

200
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.

201
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.

202
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,

203
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.

204
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.

205
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
And I think to harness science optimally,

206
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,

207
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,820
we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.

208
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
We need not just campaigning physicists,

209
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
but we need biologists, computer experts

210
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
and environmentalists as well.

211
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs

212
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
have a special obligation because they have more freedom

213
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
than those in government service,

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
or company employees subject to commercial pressure.

215
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,820
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,

216
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,

217
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,820
in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,

218
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,820
and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.

219
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past

220
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
are now part of common culture --

221
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --

222
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
(Laughter)

223
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,

224
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.

225
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,

226
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,820
but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.

227
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,820
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.

228
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,820
And it'll be another six billion before that happens,

229
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.

230
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,

231
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
experiencing the sun's demise,

232
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
but any life and intelligence that exists then

233
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,820
will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.

234
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity

235
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,820
still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.

236
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity

237
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
in our Earth and beyond.

238
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,820
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,

239
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
say from January when it was made to December,

240
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,820
the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --

241
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
a tiny fraction of the year.

242
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,

243
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
our century is very, very special,

244
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,820
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.

245
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
As I should have shown this earlier,

246
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;

247
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.

248
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
When Einstein died in 1955,

249
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon

250
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
by Herblock in the Washington Post.

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."

252
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,820
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.

253
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,820
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:

254
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,

255
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
contrasted with the sterile moonscape

256
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
on which the astronauts left their footprints.

257
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,820
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot

258
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,820
in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,

259
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.

260
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
What would they have seen?

261
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Over nearly all that immense time,

262
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.

263
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
The only abrupt worldwide change

264
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,820
would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.

265
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.

266
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
The continental landmasses drifted around.

267
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Ice cover waxed and waned.

268
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.

269
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,

270
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,

271
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.

272
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
This signaled the start of agriculture.

273
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.

274
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Then other things happened even more abruptly.

275
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Within just 50 years --

276
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,820
that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --

277
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,

278
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
and ominously fast.

279
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves --

280
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,820
the total output from all TV and cell phones

281
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
and radar transmissions. And something else happened.

282
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --

283
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
escaped into orbit around the Earth.

284
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.

285
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
A race of advanced extraterrestrials

286
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
watching our solar system from afar

287
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,820
could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.

288
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,820
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike

289
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
less than halfway through the Earth's life?

290
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
These human-induced alterations

291
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime

292
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?

293
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
If they continued their vigil,

294
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
what might these hypothetical aliens witness

295
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
in the next hundred years?

296
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?

297
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Or will the biosphere stabilize?

298
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth

299
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,820
spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?

300
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The science done by the young Einstein will continue

301
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,820
as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,

302
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --

303
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
humane, global and farseeing.

304
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,820
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century

305
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,820
will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,

306
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
far beyond the Earth as depicted here.

307
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Thank you very much.

308
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
(Applause)
