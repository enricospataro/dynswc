1
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:16,629
I want to talk a little bit today
about labor and work.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,042
When we think about how people work,

3
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,435
the naive intuition we have

4
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:25,823
is that people are like rats in a maze --

5
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:27,816
that all people care about is money,

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,492
and the moment we give them money,

7
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:31,214
we can direct them to work one way,

8
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:33,218
we can direct them to work another way.

9
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,853
This is why we give bonuses to bankers
and pay in all kinds of ways.

10
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:40,345
And we really have
this incredibly simplistic view

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,639
of why people work, and what
the labor market looks like.

12
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,986
At the same time, if you think about it,

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,319
there's all kinds of strange behaviors
in the world around us.

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,071
Think about something like mountaineering
and mountain climbing.

15
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,346
If you read books of people
who climb mountains, difficult mountains,

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,059
do you think that those books are full
of moments of joy and happiness?

17
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,836
No, they are full of misery.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,518
In fact, it's all about frostbite
and having difficulty walking,

19
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,202
and difficulty breathing --

20
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:14,264
cold, challenging circumstances.

21
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,742
And if people were just trying
to be happy,

22
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,623
the moment they would get to the top,

23
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,772
they would say,
"This was a terrible mistake.

24
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,177
I'll never do it again."

25
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,318
(Laughter)

26
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:26,957
"Instead, let me sit on a beach
somewhere drinking mojitos."

27
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:30,655
But instead, people go down,

28
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:32,997
and after they recover, they go up again.

29
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:36,646
And if you think about
mountain climbing as an example,

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,685
it suggests all kinds of things.

31
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:42,613
It suggests that we care
about reaching the end, a peak.

32
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:46,462
It suggests that we care
about the fight, about the challenge.

33
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:49,946
It suggests that there's all kinds
of other things that motivate us

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,317
to work or behave in all kinds of ways.

35
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:56,617
And for me personally,
I started thinking about this

36
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,434
after a student came to visit me.

37
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:03,810
This was one of my students
from a few years earlier,

38
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,618
and he came one day back to campus.

39
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:07,867
And he told me the following story:

40
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,601
He said that for more than two weeks,

41
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,292
he was working
on a PowerPoint presentation.

42
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,416
He was working in a big bank,

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,829
and this was in preparation
for a merger and acquisition.

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,741
And he was working very hard
on this presentation --

45
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:23,750
graphs, tables, information.

46
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:26,721
He stayed late at night every day.

47
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,474
And the day before it was due,

48
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:32,808
he sent his PowerPoint
presentation to his boss,

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,438
and his boss wrote him back and said,

50
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:38,954
"Nice presentation,
but the merger is canceled."

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,977
And the guy was deeply depressed.

52
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,455
Now at the moment when he was working,

53
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,339
he was actually quite happy.

54
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,618
Every night he was enjoying his work,

55
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:53,316
he was staying late, he was perfecting
this PowerPoint presentation.

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,011
But knowing that nobody would ever
watch it made him quite depressed.

57
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,123
So I started thinking
about how do we experiment

58
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,416
with this idea of the fruits of our labor.

59
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:09,384
And to start with, we created
a little experiment

60
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,414
in which we gave people Legos,

61
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,962
and we asked them to build with Legos.

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,297
And for some people,
we gave them Legos and we said,

63
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:24,066
"Hey, would you like to build
this Bionicle for three dollars?

64
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,140
We'll pay you three dollars for it."

65
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,311
And people said yes,
and they built with these Legos.

66
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:33,258
And when they finished, we took it,
we put it under the table,

67
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:36,267
and we said, "Would you like
to build another one,

68
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,916
this time for $2.70?"

69
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,308
If they said yes,
we gave them another one,

70
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,189
and when they finished, we asked them,

71
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:46,033
"Do you want to build another one?"
for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,

72
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,907
until at some point people said,

73
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:50,652
"No more. It's not worth it for me."

74
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:54,574
This was what we called
the meaningful condition.

75
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,625
People built one Bionicle after another.

76
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,475
After they finished every one of them,

77
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:00,844
we put them under the table.

78
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,252
And we told them that at the end
of the experiment,

79
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,352
we will take all these Bionicles,
we will disassemble them,

80
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,199
we will put them back in the boxes,

81
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:10,563
and we will use it
for the next participant.

82
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,078
There was another condition.

83
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:17,158
This other condition was inspired
by David, my student.

84
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:21,062
And this other condition we called
the Sisyphic condition.

85
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:23,271
And if you remember
the story about Sisyphus,

86
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:28,522
Sisyphus was punished by the gods
to push the same rock up a hill,

87
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,607
and when he almost got to the end,

88
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,591
the rock would roll over,
and he would have to start again.

89
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:38,487
And you can think about this
as the essence of doing futile work.

90
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,464
You can imagine that if he pushed
the rock on different hills,

91
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:44,112
at least he would have
some sense of progress.

92
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,820
Also, if you look at prison movies,

93
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:50,003
sometimes the way that the guards
torture the prisoners

94
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:53,662
is to get them to dig a hole,
and when the prisoner is finished,

95
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:56,685
they ask him to fill the hole
back up and then dig again.

96
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,891
There's something
about this cyclical version

97
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,530
of doing something over and over and over

98
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:04,007
that seems to be
particularly demotivating.

99
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,602
So in the second condition
of this experiment,

100
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,292
that's exactly what we did.

101
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:09,603
We asked people,

102
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:12,786
"Would you like to build
one Bionicle for three dollars?"

103
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,699
And if they said yes, they built it.

104
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,534
Then we asked them, "Do you want
to build another one for $2.70?"

105
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,702
And if they said yes,
we gave them a new one,

106
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,511
and as they were building it,

107
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:26,248
we took apart the one
that they just finished.

108
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:28,932
And when they finished that,

109
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,128
we said, "Would you like
to build another one,

110
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,674
this time for 30 cents less?"

111
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:33,897
And if they said yes,

112
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:37,072
we gave them the one
that they built and we broke.

113
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:40,683
So this was an endless cycle
of them building,

114
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,233
and us destroying in front of their eyes.

115
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:48,139
Now what happens when you compare
these two conditions?

116
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:51,694
The first thing that happened was
that people built many more Bionicles --

117
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,956
eleven in the meaningful condition,

118
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,718
versus seven in the Sisyphus condition.

119
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:59,855
And by the way, we should point out
that this was not big meaning.

120
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,416
People were not curing cancer
or building bridges.

121
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,179
People were building
Bionicles for a few cents.

122
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:08,156
And not only that, everybody knew

123
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,482
that the Bionicles
would be destroyed quite soon.

124
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:14,337
So there was not a real
opportunity for big meaning.

125
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,466
But even the small meaning
made a difference.

126
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,609
Now we had another version
of this experiment.

127
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,548
In this other version of the experiment,

128
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:24,515
we didn't put people in this situation,

129
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,545
we just described to them the situation,

130
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,675
much as I am describing to you now,

131
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,054
and we asked them to predict
what the result would be.

132
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:33,237
What happened?

133
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,937
People predicted the right direction
but not the right magnitude.

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,994
People who were just given
the description of the experiment

135
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,906
said that in the meaningful condition,

136
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,588
people would probably build
one more Bionicle.

137
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,841
So people understand
that meaning is important,

138
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,699
they just don't understand
the magnitude of the importance,

139
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,674
the extent to which it's important.

140
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,921
There was one other piece
of data we looked at.

141
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:59,151
If you think about it, there are
some people who love Legos,

142
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,637
and some people who don't.

143
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,224
And you would speculate
that the people who love Legos

144
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,340
would build more Legos,
even for less money,

145
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,561
because after all,
they get more internal joy from it.

146
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:11,681
And the people who love Legos less
would build less Legos

147
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:14,609
because the enjoyment
that they derive from it is lower.

148
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,561
And that's actually what we found
in the meaningful condition.

149
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:20,394
There was a very nice correlation
between the love of Legos

150
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,523
and the amount of Legos people built.

151
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,074
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?

152
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:28,110
In that condition,
the correlation was zero --

153
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,855
there was no relationship
between the love of Legos,

154
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,642
and how much people built,

155
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,341
which suggests to me
that with this manipulation

156
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,803
of breaking things
in front of people's eyes,

157
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:42,376
we basically crushed any joy
that they could get out of this activity.

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,058
We basically eliminated it.

159
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,874
Soon after I finished
running this experiment,

160
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:52,318
I went to talk to a big
software company in Seattle.

161
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:57,056
I can't tell you who they were,
but they were a big company in Seattle.

162
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,168
This was a group
within the software company

163
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,984
that was put in a different building,

164
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:02,628
and they asked them to innovate,

165
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:05,910
and create the next big product
for this company.

166
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,939
And the week before I showed up,

167
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:12,370
the CEO of this big software company
went to that group, 200 engineers,

168
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,342
and canceled the project.

169
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:17,161
And I stood there in front of 200

170
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:20,261
of the most depressed
people I've ever talked to.

171
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,457
And I described to them
some of these Lego experiments,

172
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:28,381
and they said they felt like they had
just been through that experiment.

173
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,096
And I asked them, I said,

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,712
"How many of you now show up
to work later than you used to?"

175
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,690
And everybody raised their hand.

176
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,889
I said, "How many of you now go home
earlier than you used to?"

177
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,439
Everybody raised their hand.

178
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:43,505
I asked them, "How many of you now add

179
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,662
not-so-kosher things
to your expense reports?"

180
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,337
And they didn't raise their hands,

181
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,806
but they took me out to dinner

182
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,419
and showed me what they could do
with expense reports.

183
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,852
And then I asked them, I said,

184
00:08:55,876 --> 00:09:00,217
"What could the CEO have done
to make you not as depressed?"

185
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,344
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.

186
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:05,749
They said the CEO could have asked
them to present to the whole company

187
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:07,776
about their journey
over the last two years

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,202
and what they decided to do.

189
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:12,986
He could have asked them to think
about which aspect of their technology

190
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,332
could fit with other parts
of the organization.

191
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,674
He could have asked them to build
some next-generation prototypes,

192
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,699
and see how they would work.

193
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:26,708
But the thing is that any one of those
would require some effort and motivation.

194
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,912
And I think the CEO basically did not
understand the importance of meaning.

195
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,134
If the CEO, just like our participants,

196
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:36,119
thought the essence
of meaning is unimportant,

197
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,357
then he [wouldn't] care.

198
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,280
And he would say, "At the moment
I directed you in this way,

199
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:42,327
and now that I'm directing
you in this way,

200
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,873
everything will be okay."

201
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,572
But if you understood
how important meaning is,

202
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:49,174
then you would figure out
that it's actually important

203
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,992
to spend some time, energy and effort

204
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,920
in getting people to care more
about what they're doing.

205
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:57,253
The next experiment
was slightly different.

206
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,912
We took a sheet of paper
with random letters,

207
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,023
and we asked people
to find pairs of letters

208
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,078
that were identical next to each other.

209
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,262
That was the task.

210
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:06,690
People did the first sheet,

211
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:10,059
then we asked if they wanted to do
another for a little less money,

212
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,959
the next sheet for a little bit
less, and so on and so forth.

213
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,543
And we had three conditions.

214
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:18,147
In the first condition, people
wrote their name on the sheet,

215
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,461
found all the pairs of letters,

216
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,126
gave it to the experimenter,

217
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,033
the experimenter would look at it,

218
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,792
scan it from top to bottom,

219
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:29,730
say "Uh huh," and put it
on the pile next to them.

220
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,786
In the second condition,
people did not write their name on it.

221
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,175
The experimenter looked at it,

222
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,142
took the sheet of paper,
did not look at it, did not scan it,

223
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,770
and simply put it on the pile of pages.

224
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:45,330
So you take a piece,
you just put it on the side.

225
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,679
In the third condition,

226
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:49,046
the experimenter got the sheet of paper,

227
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,552
and put it directly into a shredder.

228
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,576
(Laughter)

229
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,790
What happened in those three conditions?

230
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:02,016
In this plot I'm showing you
at what pay rate people stopped.

231
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,622
So low numbers mean
that people worked harder.

232
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,748
They worked for much longer.

233
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,326
In the acknowledged condition,

234
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,450
people worked all the way
down to 15 cents.

235
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:13,091
At 15 cents per page,

236
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,939
they basically stopped these efforts.

237
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:19,949
In the shredder condition, it was twice
as much -- 30 cents per sheet.

238
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,212
And this is basically
the result we had before.

239
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:25,600
You shred people's efforts, output --

240
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:28,284
you get them not to be as happy
with what they're doing.

241
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,012
But I should point out, by the way,

242
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,766
that in the shredder condition,
people could have cheated.

243
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,795
They could have done not so good work,

244
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,318
because they realized
people were just shredding it.

245
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:39,429
So maybe the first sheet
you'd do good work,

246
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,588
but then you see nobody
is really testing it,

247
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:43,525
so you would do more and more and more.

248
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,389
So in fact, in the shredder condition,

249
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,247
people could have submitted more work
and gotten more money,

250
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,651
and put less effort into it.

251
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,236
But what about the ignored condition?

252
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,990
Would the ignored condition
be more like the acknowledged

253
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,933
or more like the shredder,
or somewhere in the middle?

254
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,381
It turns out it was
almost like the shredder.

255
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,961
Now there's good news and bad news here.

256
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:08,800
The bad news is that ignoring
the performance of people

257
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:13,096
is almost as bad as shredding
their effort in front of their eyes.

258
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,469
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.

259
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:21,342
The good news is that by simply looking
at something that somebody has done,

260
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,359
scanning it and saying "Uh huh,"

261
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,969
that seems to be quite sufficient

262
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:27,762
to dramatically improve
people's motivations.

263
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,185
So the good news is that adding motivation

264
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,708
doesn't seem to be so difficult.

265
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,886
The bad news is
that eliminating motivations

266
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,661
seems to be incredibly easy,

267
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,477
and if we don't think about it
carefully, we might overdo it.

268
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,912
So this is all in terms
of negative motivation,

269
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,270
or eliminating negative motivation.

270
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:51,725
The next part I want to show you
is something about positive motivation.

271
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:55,980
So there is a store
in the U.S. called IKEA.

272
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,995
And IKEA is a store
with kind of okay furniture

273
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,003
that takes a long time to assemble.

274
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,136
(Laughter)

275
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,686
I don't know about you,

276
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,583
but every time I assemble one of those,

277
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,948
it takes me much longer,
it's much more effortful,

278
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:14,337
it's much more confusing,
I put things in the wrong way --

279
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,586
I can't say I enjoy those pieces.

280
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,293
I can't say I enjoy the process.

281
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,496
But when I finish it,

282
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,638
I seem to like those
IKEA pieces of furniture

283
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,514
more than I like other ones.

284
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:27,594
(Laughter)

285
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:30,971
And there's an old story about cake mixes.

286
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,805
So when they started
cake mixes in the '40s,

287
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,285
they would take this powder
and they would put it in a box,

288
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:41,350
and they would ask housewives
to basically pour it in,

289
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:43,096
stir some water in it,

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,382
mix it, put it in the oven,
and -- voila -- you had cake.

291
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,435
But it turns out they were very unpopular.

292
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,270
People did not want them,

293
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,819
and they thought about
all kinds of reasons for that.

294
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,252
Maybe the taste was not good?

295
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,452
No, the taste was great.

296
00:13:56,476 --> 00:14:01,476
What they figured out was
that there was not enough effort involved.

297
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,877
It was so easy that nobody
could serve cake to their guests

298
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:07,185
and say, "Here is my cake."

299
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,785
No, it was somebody else's cake,
as if you bought it in the store.

300
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,052
It didn't really feel like your own.

301
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,839
So what did they do?

302
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:18,109
They took the eggs and the milk
out of the powder.

303
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,859
(Laughter)

304
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:23,700
Now you had to break
the eggs and add them,

305
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:26,880
you had to measure the milk
and add it, mixing it.

306
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:29,737
Now it was your cake.
Now everything was fine.

307
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:32,125
(Laughter)

308
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:39,071
(Applause)

309
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,953
Now, I think a little bit
like the IKEA effect,

310
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:43,605
by getting people to work harder,

311
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,042
they actually got them to love
what they're doing

312
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,582
to a higher degree.

313
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,406
So how do we look at this
question experimentally?

314
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,019
We asked people to build some origami.

315
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,796
We gave them instructions
on how to create origami,

316
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,558
and we gave them a sheet of paper.

317
00:14:57,582 --> 00:14:59,400
And these were all novices,

318
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:01,978
and they built something
that was really quite ugly --

319
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,137
nothing like a frog or a crane.

320
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:07,947
But then we told them,
"Look, this origami really belongs to us.

321
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,995
You worked for us, but I'll tell
you what, we'll sell it to you.

322
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,023
How much do you want to pay for it?"

323
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,106
And we measured how much
they were willing to pay for it.

324
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,938
And we had two types of people:

325
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,906
We had the people who built it,

326
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,709
and the people who did not build it,

327
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,533
and just looked at it
as external observers.

328
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,224
And what we found
was that the builders thought

329
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:29,876
that these were beautiful
pieces of origami --

330
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,162
(Laughter)

331
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,677
and they were willing to pay
five times more for them

332
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:36,305
than the people who just
evaluated them externally.

333
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,738
Now you could say --
if you were a builder,

334
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,930
do you think [you'd say],
"Oh, I love this origami,

335
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:45,548
but I know that nobody
else would love it?"

336
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:51,688
Or "I love this origami,
and everybody else will love it as well?"

337
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:54,093
Which one of those two is correct?

338
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:57,569
Turns out the builders
not only loved the origami more,

339
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,897
they thought that everybody
would see the world in their view.

340
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,613
They thought everybody else
would love it more as well.

341
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,709
In the next version,
we tried to do the IKEA effect.

342
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,597
We tried to make it more difficult.

343
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:11,574
So for some people, we gave the same task.

344
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:15,456
For some people, we made it harder
by hiding the instructions.

345
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,203
At the top of the sheet,
we had little diagrams

346
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,186
of how you fold origami.

347
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,539
For some people, we just eliminated that.

348
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,304
So now this was tougher.

349
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:25,844
What happened?

350
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,915
Well in an objective way,

351
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:31,405
the origami now was uglier,
it was more difficult.

352
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:34,891
Now when we looked at the easy
origami, we saw the same thing --

353
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,137
builders loved it more,
evaluators loved it less.

354
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,320
When you looked at the hard instructions,

355
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,042
the effect was larger.

356
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,218
Why?

357
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:47,312
Because now the builders
loved it even more.

358
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:48,542
(Laughter)

359
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,722
They put all this extra effort into it.

360
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,008
And evaluators?

361
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,659
They loved it even less.

362
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:58,532
Because in reality, it was even uglier
than the first version.

363
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:59,897
(Laughter)

364
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:03,893
Of course, this tells you something
about how we evaluate things.

365
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,234
Now think about kids.

366
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:10,143
Imagine I asked you, "How much
would you sell your kids for?"

367
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,576
Your memories and associations and so on.

368
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,239
Most people would say
for a lot, a lot of money.

369
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,427
(Laughter)

370
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,835
On good days.

371
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,099
(Laughter)

372
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,028
But imagine this was slightly different.

373
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:23,862
Imagine if you did not have your kids.

374
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:26,621
And one day you went to the park
and you met some kids.

375
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,127
They were just like your kids,

376
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:30,169
and you played with them for a few hours,

377
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:33,542
and when you were about to leave,
the parents said, "Hey, by the way,

378
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,549
just before you leave,
if you're interested, they're for sale."

379
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,679
(Laughter)

380
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,933
How much would you pay for them now?

381
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:43,720
Most people say not that much.

382
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:48,539
And this is because our kids
are so valuable,

383
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,693
not just because of who they are,

384
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,328
but because of us,

385
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:54,512
because they are so connected to us,

386
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:57,107
and because of the time and connection.

387
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:00,038
By the way, if you think
IKEA instructions are not good,

388
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,450
what about the instructions that come
with kids, those are really tough.

389
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,482
(Laughter)

390
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:08,748
By the way, these are my kids, which,
of course, are wonderful and so on.

391
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,696
Which comes to tell you one more thing,

392
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,170
which is, much like our builders,

393
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:17,035
when they look at the creature
of their creation,

394
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,323
we don't see that other people
don't see things our way.

395
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,117
Let me say one last comment.

396
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:28,775
If you think about Adam Smith
versus Karl Marx,

397
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,014
Adam Smith had a very important
notion of efficiency.

398
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,712
He gave an example of a pin factory.

399
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:38,241
He said pins have 12 different steps,

400
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:42,170
and if one person does all 12 steps,
production is very low.

401
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,766
But if you get one person to do step one,

402
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,543
and one person to do step two
and step three and so on,

403
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,178
production can increase tremendously.

404
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:51,941
And indeed, this is a great example,

405
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,416
and the reason for the Industrial
Revolution and efficiency.

406
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,676
Karl Marx, on the other hand,

407
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,161
said that the alienation
of labor is incredibly important

408
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:04,581
in how people think about the connection
to what they are doing.

409
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,875
And if you do all 12 steps,
you care about the pin.

410
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:11,351
But if you do one step every time,
maybe you don't care as much.

411
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:15,173
I think that in the Industrial Revolution,

412
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,784
Adam Smith was more
correct than Karl Marx.

413
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:21,143
But the reality is that we've switched,

414
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,175
and now we're in the knowledge economy.

415
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,086
You can ask yourself, what happens
in a knowledge economy?

416
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,357
Is efficiency still more
important than meaning?

417
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:30,791
I think the answer is no.

418
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,009
I think that as we move to situations

419
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,992
in which people have
to decide on their own

420
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:40,186
about how much effort, attention,
caring, how connected they feel to it,

421
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,585
are they thinking about labor
on the way to work,

422
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,186
and in the shower and so on,

423
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,798
all of a sudden Marx
has more things to say to us.

424
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,069
So when we think about labor,

425
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:53,493
we usually think about motivation
and payment as the same thing,

426
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:57,119
but the reality is that we should
probably add all kinds of things to it --

427
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:01,339
meaning, creation, challenges,
ownership, identity, pride, etc.

428
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,326
The good news is that if we added
all of those components

429
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,928
and thought about them --

430
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:09,365
how do we create our own
meaning, pride, motivation,

431
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,239
and how do we do it in our workplace,

432
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,661
and for the employees --

433
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:16,650
I think we could get people to be
both more productive and happier.

434
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,980
Thank you very much.

435
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,804
(Applause)
