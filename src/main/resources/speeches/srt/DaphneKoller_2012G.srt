1
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,656
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.

2
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:19,056
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.

3
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:23,294
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.

4
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:27,088
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.

5
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:30,937
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,

6
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:34,738
which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.

7
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,858
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.

8
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:41,993
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,

9
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,698
education is just not readily accessible.

10
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,673
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,546
in the days of apartheid for the white minority.

12
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:53,246
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots

13
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:57,098
for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.

14
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,978
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year

15
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,814
at the University of Johannesburg.

16
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,945
There were a handful of positions left open

17
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,914
from the standard admissions process, and the night before

18
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,474
they were supposed to open that for registration,

19
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:14,526
thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,

20
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:18,406
hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.

21
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,714
When the gates opened, there was a stampede,

22
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,366
and 20 people were injured and one woman died.

23
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,306
She was a mother who gave her life

24
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:30,369
trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,526
But even in parts of the world like the United States

26
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,882
where education is available, it might not be within reach.

27
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:40,554
There has been much discussed in the last few years

28
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:42,543
about the rising cost of health care.

29
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:45,185
What might not be quite as obvious to people

30
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:49,207
is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition

31
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,687
has been increasing at almost twice the rate,

32
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:55,967
for a total of 559 percent since 1985.

33
00:01:55,967 --> 00:02:00,501
This makes education unaffordable for many people.

34
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:04,302
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,

35
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:06,927
the doors of opportunity might not open.

36
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:10,134
Only a little over half of recent college graduates

37
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,447
in the United States who get a higher education

38
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,910
actually are working in jobs that require that education.

39
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,750
This, of course, is not true for the students

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,702
who graduate from the top institutions,

41
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:22,334
but for many others, they do not get the value

42
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,870
for their time and their effort.

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,900
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,268
captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.

45
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:36,388
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen

46
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:40,287
when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.

47
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,908
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.

48
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,420
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.

49
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,539
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by

50
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,107
three big Stanford classes,

51
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:53,987
each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.

52
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:57,371
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,

53
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,291
the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague

54
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,020
and cofounder Andrew Ng.

55
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,339
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.

56
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,548
It's a Machine Learning class,

57
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:08,066
and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.

58
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:11,331
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,

59
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:13,947
it had 100,000 people registered.

60
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,956
So to put that number in perspective,

61
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,315
for Andrew to reach that same size audience

62
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:20,141
by teaching a Stanford class,

63
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,067
he would have to do that for 250 years.

64
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,553
Of course, he'd get really bored.

65
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:30,290
So, having seen the impact of this,

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,418
Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,

67
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:37,538
to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.

68
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,033
So we formed Coursera,

69
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:42,170
whose goal is to take the best courses

70
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,487
from the best instructors at the best universities

71
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:49,515
and provide it to everyone around the world for free.

72
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:52,115
We currently have 43 courses on the platform

73
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:55,314
from four universities across a range of disciplines,

74
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,147
and let me show you a little bit of an overview

75
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,425
of what that looks like.

76
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:01,638
(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.

77
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:03,518
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.

78
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:06,789
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.

79
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,197
We get unbelievable segregation.

80
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,989
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,

81
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,367
you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.

82
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:17,621
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...

83
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,286
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.

84
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:24,357
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.

85
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:27,334
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.

86
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,957
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.

87
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:34,573
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.

88
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:38,260
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...

89
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,869
(Applause)

90
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,143
DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,

91
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:48,381
that students like getting the best content

92
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,268
from the best universities for free.

93
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,790
Since we opened the website in February,

94
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,148
we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.

95
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:00,300
We have 1.5 million enrollments,

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,150
6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched

97
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,066
so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.

98
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,584
But it's not just about the numbers,

99
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,225
it's also about the people.

100
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,201
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India

101
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,376
and would never have access in this case

102
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,865
to a Stanford-quality course

103
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,380
and would never be able to afford it.

104
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,418
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two

105
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:25,385
and wants to hone her skills

106
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:28,520
so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,656
Or Ryan, who can't go to school,

108
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,521
because his immune deficient daughter

109
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,904
can't be risked to have germs come into the house,

110
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,744
so he couldn't leave the house.

111
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:40,376
I'm really glad to say --

112
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,628
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --

113
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:44,560
that this story had a happy ending.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,463
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --

115
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:47,814
is doing much better now,

116
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:52,012
and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.

117
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,256
So what made these courses so different?

118
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:57,976
After all, online course content has been available for a while.

119
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:01,688
What made it different was that this was real course experience.

120
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,414
It started on a given day,

121
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:07,048
and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis

122
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:08,903
and do homework assignments.

123
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,694
And these would be real homework assignments

124
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,998
for a real grade, with a real deadline.

125
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,054
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.

126
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:18,142
These are the spikes showing

127
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:21,931
that procrastination is global phenomenon.

128
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,507
(Laughter)

129
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,179
At the end of the course,

130
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,035
the students got a certificate.

131
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,195
They could present that certificate

132
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,348
to a prospective employer and get a better job,

133
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,408
and we know many students who did.

134
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:36,327
Some students took their certificate

135
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,449
and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled

136
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,290
for actual college credit.

137
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,504
So these students were really getting something meaningful

138
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,338
for their investment of time and effort.

139
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,893
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components

140
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,785
that go into these courses.

141
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,413
The first component is that when you move away

142
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,710
from the constraints of a physical classroom

143
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,550
and design content explicitly for an online format,

144
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,078
you can break away from, for example,

145
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,493
the monolithic one-hour lecture.

146
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,278
You can break up the material, for example,

147
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:08,654
into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,

148
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,628
each of which represents a coherent concept.

149
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:14,198
Students can traverse this material in different ways,

150
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:17,902
depending on their background, their skills or their interests.

151
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,422
So, for example, some students might benefit

152
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:23,182
from a little bit of preparatory material

153
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,253
that other students might already have.

154
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,693
Other students might be interested in a particular

155
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:30,779
enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.

156
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,014
So this format allows us to break away

157
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:36,838
from the one-size-fits-all model of education,

158
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:40,830
and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

159
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,173
Of course, we all know as educators

160
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:46,533
that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.

161
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,478
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort

162
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,070
is that we need to have students

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,479
who practice with the material

164
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,635
in order to really understand it.

165
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,903
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.

166
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,435
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,

167
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:06,267
demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,

168
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:09,059
where students are just supposed to repeat

169
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,459
what they already learned

170
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,379
gives considerably improved results

171
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,648
on various achievement tests down the line

172
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:18,952
than many other educational interventions.

173
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,914
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,

174
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,168
as well as other forms of practice in many ways.

175
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:28,312
For example, even our videos are not just videos.

176
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:30,355
Every few minutes, the video pauses

177
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,506
and the students get asked a question.

178
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,727
(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,

179
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,819
status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.

180
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,586
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.

181
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,210
DK: So here the video pauses,

182
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,466
and the student types in the answer into the box

183
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,689
and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.

184
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:48,573
(Laughter)

185
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,583
So they get to try again,

186
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,119
and this time they got it right.

187
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,312
There's an optional explanation if they want.

188
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:59,569
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.

189
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,447
This is a kind of simple question

190
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,528
that I as an instructor might ask in class,

191
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,028
but when I ask that kind of a question in class,

192
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:07,328
80 percent of the students

193
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,194
are still scribbling the last thing I said,

194
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,515
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,

195
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,971
and then there's the smarty pants in the front row

196
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,330
who blurts out the answer

197
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,537
before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,

198
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,409
and I as the instructor am terribly gratified

199
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,057
that somebody actually knew the answer.

200
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:25,849
And so the lecture moves on before, really,

201
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:29,378
most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.

202
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,985
Here, every single student

203
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,769
has to engage with the material.

204
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,705
And of course these simple retrieval questions

205
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:38,367
are not the end of the story.

206
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,337
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,

207
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,690
and one also needs to provide the students with feedback

208
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,353
on those questions.

209
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:48,241
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students

210
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:51,323
if you do not have 10,000 TAs?

211
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,677
The answer is, you need to use technology

212
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,172
to do it for you.

213
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:57,820
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,

214
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,088
and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.

215
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:02,615
In addition to multiple choice

216
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,768
and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,

217
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:09,028
we can also grade math, mathematical expressions

218
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,980
as well as mathematical derivations.

219
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,854
We can grade models, whether it's

220
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,030
financial models in a business class

221
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,014
or physical models in a science or engineering class

222
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:22,758
and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

223
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,677
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple

224
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,157
but fairly visual.

225
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,634
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,

226
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,238
and the students are supposed to color-correct

227
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,830
that blurry red image.

228
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,848
They're typing their program into the browser,

229
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:37,906
and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.

230
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,662
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,

231
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:44,021
and they can move on to the next assignment.

232
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:47,169
This ability to interact actively with the material

233
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,853
and be told when you're right or wrong

234
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,979
is really essential to student learning.

235
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,254
Now, of course we cannot yet grade

236
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,088
the range of work that one needs for all courses.

237
00:10:57,088 --> 00:11:00,389
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work

238
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,311
that is so essential in such disciplines

239
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,908
as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.

240
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:08,157
So we tried to convince, for example,

241
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,773
some of our humanities faculty

242
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,469
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.

243
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,660
That didn't go over really well.

244
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,093
So we had to come up with a different solution.

245
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,167
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.

246
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,589
It turns out that previous studies show,

247
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,261
like this one by Saddler and Good,

248
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,749
that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy

249
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:29,963
for providing reproducible grades.

250
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,733
It was tried only in small classes,

251
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,220
but there it showed, for example,

252
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,702
that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis

253
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,013
are actually very well correlated

254
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:39,309
with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.

255
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,469
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,

256
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,780
where the students grade their own work critically --

257
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,517
so long as you incentivize them properly

258
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,455
so they can't give themselves a perfect score --

259
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,646
are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.

260
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,253
And so this is an effective strategy

261
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,357
that can be used for grading at scale,

262
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:58,093
and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,

263
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,348
because they actually learn from the experience.

264
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:04,997
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,

265
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:07,501
where tens of thousands of students

266
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,699
are grading each other's work,

267
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,768
and quite successfully, I have to say.

268
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,028
But this is not just about students

269
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:17,069
sitting alone in their living room working through problems.

270
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,876
Around each one of our courses,

271
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,036
a community of students had formed,

272
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,916
a global community of people

273
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,448
around a shared intellectual endeavor.

274
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,100
What you see here is a self-generated map

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,061
from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,

276
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,820
where they have put themselves on a world map,

277
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,780
and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.

278
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,347
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.

279
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:43,986
First of all, there was a question and answer forum,

280
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,130
where students would pose questions,

281
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,554
and other students would answer those questions.

282
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,267
And the really amazing thing is,

283
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,937
because there were so many students,

284
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,302
it means that even if a student posed a question

285
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,934
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

286
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,516
somewhere around the world,

287
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,590
there would be somebody who was awake

288
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,903
and working on the same problem.

289
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,861
And so, in many of our courses,

290
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,190
the median response time for a question

291
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,608
on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.

292
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:14,185
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.

293
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,526
(Laughter)

294
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,468
And you can see from the student testimonials

295
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,155
that students actually find

296
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:21,676
that because of this large online community,

297
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,275
they got to interact with each other in many ways

298
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:28,468
that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.

299
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,812
Students also self-assembled,

300
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,675
without any kind of intervention from us,

301
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,578
into small study groups.

302
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,940
Some of these were physical study groups

303
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,766
along geographical constraints

304
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,488
and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.

305
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,388
This is the San Francisco study group,

306
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:45,707
but there were ones all over the world.

307
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,739
Others were virtual study groups,

308
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,728
sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

309
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,172
and on the bottom left there,

310
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,968
you see our multicultural universal study group

311
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,731
where people explicitly wanted to connect

312
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,737
with people from other cultures.

313
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:02,848
There are some tremendous opportunities

314
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:06,173
to be had from this kind of framework.

315
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:09,827
The first is that it has the potential of giving us

316
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,261
a completely unprecedented look

317
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,550
into understanding human learning.

318
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,013
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.

319
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:22,022
You can collect every click, every homework submission,

320
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:26,385
every forum post from tens of thousands of students.

321
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:28,728
So you can turn the study of human learning

322
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,661
from the hypothesis-driven mode

323
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,519
to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,

324
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
for example, has revolutionized biology.

325
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,984
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions

326
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,864
like, what are good learning strategies

327
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,560
that are effective versus ones that are not?

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
And in the context of particular courses,

329
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,337
you can ask questions

330
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,592
like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common

331
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,769
and how do we help students fix them?

332
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,193
So here's an example of that,

333
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,209
also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.

334
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,417
This is a distribution of wrong answers

335
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,027
to one of Andrew's assignments.

336
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,920
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,

337
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,191
so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.

338
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:08,969
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.

339
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,375
The big cross at the top left

340
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,523
is where 2,000 students

341
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,568
gave the exact same wrong answer.

342
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,895
Now, if two students in a class of 100

343
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,182
give the same wrong answer,

344
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,533
you would never notice.

345
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,093
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,

346
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,790
it's kind of hard to miss.

347
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,982
So Andrew and his students went in,

348
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:29,502
looked at some of those assignments,

349
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:33,590
understood the root cause of the misconception,

350
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,110
and then they produced a targeted error message

351
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,359
that would be provided to every student

352
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,538
whose answer fell into that bucket,

353
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:42,622
which means that students who made that same mistake

354
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,648
would now get personalized feedback

355
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:49,047
telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

356
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,858
So this personalization is something that one can then build

357
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:55,998
by having the virtue of large numbers.

358
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,310
Personalization is perhaps

359
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,733
one of the biggest opportunities here as well,

360
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,078
because it provides us with the potential

361
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,768
of solving a 30-year-old problem.

362
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:09,117
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,

363
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:11,368
posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,

364
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,430
which he observed by studying three populations.

365
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,038
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.

366
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:20,815
The second is a population of students that studied

367
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,534
using a standard lecture-based classroom,

368
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:24,614
but with a mastery-based approach,

369
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,534
so the students couldn't move on to the next topic

370
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,888
before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.

371
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,182
And finally, there was a population of students

372
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:36,710
that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.

373
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,982
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,

374
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,270
or sigma, in achievement scores better

375
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,664
than the standard lecture-based class,

376
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,808
and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma

377
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,638
improvement in performance.

378
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,101
To understand what that means,

379
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,934
let's look at the lecture-based classroom,

380
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,853
and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.

381
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:56,191
So in a lecture-based class,

382
00:16:56,191 --> 00:17:00,070
half the students are above that level and half are below.

383
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,168
In the individual tutoring instruction,

384
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:06,969
98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.

385
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:10,889
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students

386
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,087
would be above average.

387
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:16,510
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

388
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,909
Because we cannot afford, as a society,

389
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:21,981
to provide every student with an individual human tutor.

390
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,230
But maybe we can afford to provide each student

391
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,249
with a computer or a smartphone.

392
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:28,438
So the question is, how can we use technology

393
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,813
to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,

394
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,551
to the right side with the green curve?

395
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,888
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,

396
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,293
because a computer doesn't get tired

397
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:41,366
of showing you the same video five times.

398
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:44,617
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,

399
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:47,648
we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.

400
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:49,502
And even personalization

401
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,638
is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,

402
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,830
whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum

403
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,094
or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.

404
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:00,582
So the goal here is to try and push,

405
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:04,079
and see how far we can get towards the green curve.

406
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,438
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?

407
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:12,430
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.

408
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,975
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes

409
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,678
go straight to the students' lecture notes,

410
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,054
without passing through the brains of either."

411
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:23,101
(Laughter)

412
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,769
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.

413
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,434
I think what he was complaining about is not

414
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:31,184
universities but rather the lecture-based format

415
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,968
that so many universities spend so much time on.

416
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:37,127
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch,

417
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,354
who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,

418
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,377
but wood that needs igniting."

419
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,567
And maybe we should spend less time at universities

420
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,138
filling our students' minds with content

421
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:49,938
by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,

422
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:53,193
their imagination and their problem-solving skills

423
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,691
by actually talking with them.

424
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,058
So how do we do that?

425
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,489
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.

426
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,938
So there's been many studies, including this one,

427
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:05,018
that show that if you use active learning,

428
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,434
interacting with your students in the classroom,

429
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:10,130
performance improves on every single metric --

430
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,579
on attendance, on engagement and on learning

431
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,634
as measured by a standardized test.

432
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,498
You can see, for example, that the achievement score

433
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:19,368
almost doubles in this particular experiment.

434
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:23,769
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.

435
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:28,346
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education

436
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,249
to everyone around the world for free,

437
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,070
what would that do? Three things.

438
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,491
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,

439
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:37,857
where anyone around the world

440
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,778
with the ability and the motivation

441
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,729
could get the skills that they need

442
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,314
to make a better life for themselves,

443
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,331
their families and their communities.

444
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,962
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.

445
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:49,913
It's a shame that for so many people,

446
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:53,225
learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.

447
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,706
By having this amazing content be available,

448
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,449
we would be able to learn something new

449
00:19:58,449 --> 00:19:59,585
every time we wanted,

450
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:00,914
whether it's just to expand our minds

451
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,873
or it's to change our lives.

452
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:06,018
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,

453
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:09,090
because amazing talent can be found anywhere.

454
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,098
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs

455
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,713
is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.

456
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,369
And if we could offer that person an education,

457
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,725
they would be able to come up with the next big idea

458
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:22,129
and make the world a better place for all of us.

459
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,289
Thank you very much.

460
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:30,872
(Applause)
