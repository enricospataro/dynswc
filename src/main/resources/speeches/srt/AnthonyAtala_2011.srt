1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
There's actually a major health crisis today

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
in terms of the shortage of organs.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
The fact is that we're living longer.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
Medicine has done a much better job

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
of making us live longer,

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
and the problem is, as we age,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
our organs tend to fail more,

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and so currently

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
there are not enough organs to go around.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
In fact, in the last 10 years,

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
while in the same time,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
So this is now a public health crisis.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
So that's where this field comes in

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that we call the field of regenerative medicine.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
It really involves many different areas.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
You can use, actually, scaffolds,

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
biomaterials --

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
but specific materials you can actually implant in patients

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
and they will do well and help you regenerate.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
Or we can use cells alone,

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
either your very own cells

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
or different stem cell populations.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
Or we can use both.

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
We can use, actually, biomaterials

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
and the cells together.

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
And that's where the field is today.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
But it's actually not a new field.

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
Interestingly, this is a book

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
that was published back in 1938.

33
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
He actually devised some of the same technologies

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
used today for suturing blood vessels,

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
were actually designed by Alexis.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
But I want you to note his co-author:

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Charles Lindbergh.

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
That's the same Charles Lindbergh

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
who actually spent the rest of his life

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
working with Alexis

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
at the Rockefeller Institute in New York

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
in the area of the culture of organs.

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
So if the field's been around for so long,

47
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
why so few clinical advances?

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
And that really has to do to many different challenges.

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
But if I were to point to three challenges,

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
the first one is actually the design of materials

51
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
that could go in your body

52
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
and do well over time.

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And many advances now,

54
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
we can do that fairly readily.

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
The second challenge was cells.

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.

58
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells.

59
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Plus we have stem cells.

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
But even now, 2011,

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.

62
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --

63
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
we still can't grow them even today.

64
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And the third challenge is vascularity,

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
the actual supply of blood

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
to allow those organs or tissues to survive

67
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
once we regenerate them.

68
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
So we can actually use biomaterials now.

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
This is actually a biomaterial.

70
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.

71
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
This is actually like a cotton candy machine.

72
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
You saw the spray going in.

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
creating this structure, this tubularized structure,

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
which is a biomaterial

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
that we can then use

77
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
to help your body regenerate

78
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
using your very own cells to do so.

79
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
And that's exactly what we did here.

80
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
This is actually a patient

81
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
who [was] presented with a deceased organ,

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
and we then created one of these smart biomaterials,

83
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
and then we then used that smart biomaterial

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
to replace and repair

85
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
that patient's structure.

86
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
What we did was we actually

87
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
used the biomaterial as a bridge

88
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
so that the cells in the organ

89
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
could walk on that bridge, if you will,

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
and help to bridge the gap

91
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
to regenerate that tissue.

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
And you see that patient now six months after

93
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
which is fully regenerated

95
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
when you analyze it under the microscope.

96
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
We can also use cells alone.

97
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
These are actually cells that we obtained.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
These are stem cells that we create from specific sources,

99
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and we can drive them to become heart cells,

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and they start beating in culture.

101
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
So they know what to do.

102
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
The cells genetically know what to do,

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
and they start beating together.

104
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Now today, many clinical trials

105
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
are using different kinds of stem cells

106
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
for heart disease.

107
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
So that's actually now in patients.

108
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Or if we're going to use larger structures

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
to replace larger structures,

110
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
we can then use the patient's own cells,

111
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
or some cell population,

112
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
and the biomaterials,

113
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
the scaffolds, together.

114
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
So the concept here:

115
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
so if you do have a deceased or injured organ,

116
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
we take a very small piece of that tissue,

117
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

118
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
We then tease the cells apart,

119
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
we grow the cells outside the body.

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --

121
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --

122
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
we then shape that material,

123
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
and we then use those cells to coat that material

124
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
one layer at a time --

125
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

126
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
We then place it in an oven-like device,

127
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
and we're able to create that structure

128
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and bring it out.

129
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
This is actually a heart valve

130
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
that we've engineered,

131
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve

132
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
and we've seeded that with cells,

133
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
and then we exercise it.

134
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
So you see the leaflets opening and closing --

135
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
of this heart valve

136
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,820
that's currently being used experimentally

137
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
to try to get it to further studies.

138
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Another technology

139
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
that we have used in patients

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
actually involves bladders.

141
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --

142
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

143
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
We then grow the cells outside the body,

144
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --

145
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
the patient's own cells, two different cell types.

146
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
We then put it in this oven-like device.

147
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
It has the same conditions as the human body --

148
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.

149
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ

150
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
that we're able to implant back into the patient.

151
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.

152
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis,

153
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
but we actually created these biomaterials by hand.

154
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
But we now have better ways

155
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
to create these structures with the cells.

156
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,820
We use now some type of technologies,

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
where for solid organs, for example,

158
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
like the liver,

159
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
what we do is we take discard livers.

160
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.

161
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
So we can take these liver structures,

162
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
which are not going to be used,

163
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure

164
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
that will allow the cells to be washed away.

165
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Two weeks later,

166
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
you have something that looks like a liver.

167
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
You can hold it like a liver,

168
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.

169
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,820
And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
preserving the blood vessel tree.

171
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree

172
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
with the patient's own blood vessel cells,

173
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.

174
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
And we now have been able just to show

175
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
the creation of human liver tissue

176
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
just this past month

177
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
using this technology.

178
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Another technology that we've used

179
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
is actually that of printing.

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer,

181
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
but instead of using ink,

182
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
we're using cells.

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
And you can actually see here the printhead

184
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
going through and printing this structure,

185
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.

186
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
And there's a 3D elevator

187
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
that then actually goes down one layer at a time

188
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
each time the printhead goes through.

189
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
And then finally you're able to get that structure out.

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.

191
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And this is actually a piece of bone

192
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
that I'm going to show you in this slide

193
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
that was actually created with this desktop printer

194
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and implanted as you see here.

195
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
That was all new bone that was implanted

196
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
using these techniques.

197
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now,

198
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
our next generation of technologies,

199
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
are more sophisticated printers.

200
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
This particular printer we're designing now

201
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
is actually one where we print right on the patient.

202
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
So what you see here --

203
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
I know it sounds funny,

204
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
but that's the way it works.

205
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Because in reality, what you want to do

206
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,

207
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
and you have a scanner,

208
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
basically like a flatbed scanner.

209
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
That's what you see here on the right side.

210
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
You see a scanner technology

211
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
that first scans the wound on the patient

212
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
and then it comes back with the printheads

213
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
actually printing the layers that you require

214
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
on the patients themselves.

215
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
This is how it actually works.

216
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Here's the scanner going through,

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
scanning the wound.

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Once it's scanned,

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
it sends information in the correct layers of cells

220
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
where they need to be.

221
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And now you're going to see here

222
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
a demo of this actually being done

223
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
in a representative wound.

224
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.

225
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
So once those cells are on the patient

226
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
they will stick where they need to be.

227
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
And this is actually new technology

228
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
still under development.

229
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
We're also working on more sophisticated printers.

230
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Because in reality, our biggest challenge

231
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
are the solid organs.

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
I don't know if you realize this,

233
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,820
but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
are actually waiting for a kidney.

235
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Patients are dying every day

236
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
because we don't have enough of those organs to go around.

237
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
So this is more challenging --

238
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
large organ, vascular,

239
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
a lot of blood vessel supply,

240
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
a lot of cells present.

241
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
So the strategy here is --

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --

243
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
and we go layer by layer,

244
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
using computerized morphometric imaging analysis

245
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
and 3D reconstruction

246
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
to get right down to those patient's own kidneys.

247
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
We then are able to actually image those,

248
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
do 360 degree rotation

249
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
to analyze the kidney

250
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,820
in its full volumetric characteristics,

251
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
and we then are able

252
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
to actually take this information

253
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and then scan this

254
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
in a printing computerized form.

255
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
So we go layer by layer through the organ,

256
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
analyzing each layer as we go through the organ,

257
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,820
and we then are able to send that information, as you see here,

258
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
through the computer

259
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
and actually design the organ

260
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
for the patient.

261
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
This actually shows the actual printer.

262
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And this actually shows that printing.

263
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,820
In fact, we actually have the printer right here.

264
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
So while we've been talking today,

265
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
you can actually see the printer

266
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
back here in the back stage.

267
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
That's actually the actual printer right now,

268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
and that's been printing this kidney structure

269
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
that you see here.

270
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
It takes about seven hours to print a kidney,

271
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
so this is about three hours into it now.

272
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,

273
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys

274
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
that we printed a little bit earlier today.

275
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Put a pair of gloves here.

276
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Thank you.

277
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Go backwards.

278
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.

279
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
You can actually see that kidney

280
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
as it was printed earlier today.

281
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:55,820
(Applause)

282
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Has a little bit of consistency to it.

283
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,

284
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
and part of our team.

285
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.

286
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,820
(Applause)

287
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
So this is actually a new generation.

288
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.

289
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now.

290
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
In reality, we now have a long history of doing this.

291
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I'm going to share with you a clip

292
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.

293
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
And this is actually a very brief clip --

294
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
only about 30 seconds --

295
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
of a patient who actually received an organ.

296
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.

297
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.

298
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
I couldn't go out

299
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
and play basketball at recess

300
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
without feeling like I was going to pass out

301
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
when I got back inside.

302
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I felt so sick.

303
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,

304
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like

305
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
if I was on that.

306
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
So after the surgery,

307
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
life got a lot better for me.

308
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I was able to do more things.

309
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
I was able to wrestle in high school.

310
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
I became the captain of the team, and that was great.

311
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.

312
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder,

313
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
it's going to be with me.

314
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I've got it for life, so I'm all set.

315
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:59,820
(Applause)

316
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,

317
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
and it's very cool when they do.

318
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Luke, come up please.

319
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:25,820
(Applause)

320
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
So Luke, before last night,

321
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
when's the last time you saw Tony?

322
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --

323
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
and it's really great to see him.

324
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
(Laughter)

325
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,820
(Applause)

326
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.

327
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.

328
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,

329
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
and basically trying to live life like a normal kid,

330
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
which I always wanted growing up.

331
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida

332
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
and my kidneys and bladder weren't working.

333
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I went through about 16 surgeries,

334
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
and it seemed impossible to do that

335
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
when I was in kidney failure when I was 10.

336
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
And this surgery came along

337
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
and basically made me who I am today

338
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
and saved my life.

339
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:25,820
(Applause)

340
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?

341
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab

342
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
and coming up with crazy stuff.

343
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.

344
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.

345
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
I was a little kid, and I was like,

346
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."

347
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
(Laughter)

348
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
All I wanted to do was to get better,

349
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older

350
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
and I see the amazing things that he's doing.

351
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
JE: When you got this call out of the blue --

352
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Tony's really shy,

353
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
and it took a lot of convincing

354
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
to get somebody as modest as Tony

355
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
to allow us to bring Luke.

356
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
So Luke, you go to your communications professors --

357
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
you're majoring in communications --

358
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
and you ask them for permission to come to TED,

359
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
which might have a little bit to do with communications,

360
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and what was their reaction?

361
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
LM: Most of my professors were all for it,

362
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
and they said, "Bring pictures

363
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."

364
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
There were a couple that were a little stubborn,

365
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
but I had to talk to them.

366
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I pulled them aside.

367
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.

368
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)

369
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
JE: Thank you, Tony.

370
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
(Applause)
