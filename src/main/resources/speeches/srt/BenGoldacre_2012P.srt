00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:15,276
Hi. So, this chap here,

2
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,538
he thinks he can tell you the future.

3
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:19,517
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have

4
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:23,187
made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)

5
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:26,090
And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,198
that people can see into the future.

7
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:29,902
I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,

8
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:33,084
you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,

9
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:36,143
and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only

10
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:38,758
hear about the flukes and about the freaks.

11
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:42,837
We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.

12
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,997
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories

13
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:48,136
about precognition, but the problem is,

14
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:51,480
we have exactly the same problem in academia

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,981
and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.

16
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,346
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,

17
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:01,875
just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted

18
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,711
a piece of research where he found evidence

19
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:07,369
of precognitive powers in undergraduate students,

20
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,943
and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal

21
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:12,224
and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well,

22
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:14,405
fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know

23
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:17,239
that if I did a study where I found no evidence

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,751
that undergraduate students had precognitive powers,

25
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,303
it probably wouldn't get published in a journal.

26
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:26,158
And in fact, we know that that's true, because

27
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:28,687
several different groups of research scientists tried

28
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:32,207
to replicate the findings of this precognition study,

29
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,842
and when they submitted it to the exact same journal,

30
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:37,994
the journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing

31
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:42,519
replication. We're not interested in your negative data."

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,273
So this is already evidence of how, in the academic

33
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:50,143
literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture

34
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,610
of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,039
But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.

36
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,406
It also happens in, for example, cancer research.

37
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:06,483
So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers

38
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:09,379
reported in the journal Nature how they had tried

39
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,225
to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at

40
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,780
potential treatment targets in cancer,

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,418
and out of those 53 studies, they were only able

42
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:22,494
to successfully replicate six.

43
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:26,827
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.

44
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:30,740
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,379
because freaks get published.

46
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,475
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,

47
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,595
and the occasions when it works they will publish,

48
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,274
and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.

49
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:43,215
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,

50
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,504
because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,

51
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:48,210
their first recommendation of how to fix this problem

52
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,603
is to make it easier to publish negative results in science,

53
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,510
and to change the incentives so that scientists are

54
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,862
encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.

55
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:02,714
But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world

56
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:06,565
of preclinical basic science cancer research.

57
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,222
It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood

58
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:13,813
of academic medicine. So in 1980,

59
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:16,821
some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,

60
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,152
and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,

61
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:21,403
a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,

62
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:23,646
and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,

63
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,183
they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,

64
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:27,560
so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,273
rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.

66
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:34,281
Early on its development, they did a very small trial,

67
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,925
just under a hundred patients.

68
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:39,577
Fifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.

69
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,620
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill

70
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,578
with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.

71
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:48,227
So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,

72
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:51,096
and its commercial development was stopped, and because

73
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:55,444
its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.

74
00:03:55,444 --> 00:04:00,841
Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,

75
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,666
other companies had the same idea about drugs that would

76
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,258
prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.

77
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:08,978
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed

78
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:12,390
very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,

79
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,233
and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs

80
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:19,144
also caused an increased rate of death

81
00:04:19,144 --> 00:04:21,891
that before we detected that safety signal,

82
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:27,942
over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America

83
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:31,393
from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.

84
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:34,991
Now actually, in 1993,

85
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:38,551
the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,

86
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,392
published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,

87
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:45,517
in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980,

88
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,453
we thought that the increased death rate that occurred

89
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,811
in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."

90
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,843
The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,

91
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,481
and this study was never published;

92
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,867
it's now a good example of publication bias.

93
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,758
That's the technical term for the phenomenon where

94
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:02,996
unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left

95
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:06,367
missing in action, and they say the results described here

96
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:11,175
"might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."

97
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,388
Now these are stories from basic science.

98
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:19,175
These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.

99
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:22,322
The academic publishing environment is very different now.

100
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,317
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal,

101
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,972
which will publish any trial conducted in humans

102
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:32,275
regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.

103
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:36,244
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action

104
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:39,803
is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent

105
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:45,654
that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.

106
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,669
So this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug

107
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,204
that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.

108
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:53,740
And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies

109
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,792
that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published

110
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,739
that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,

111
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,603
and I read the other three studies that were published

112
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:05,174
that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,

113
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,361
and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,

114
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,827
I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.

115
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,219
But it turned out that I was misled. In fact,

116
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,668
seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine

117
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,380
against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,692
was positive and that was published, but six of them

119
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:24,740
were negative and they were left unpublished.

120
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,479
Three trials were published comparing reboxetine

121
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,705
against other antidepressants in which reboxetine

122
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,498
was just as good, and they were published,

123
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:34,887
but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected

124
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,758
which showed that reboxetine was worse than

125
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:41,459
those other treatments, and those trials were not published.

126
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,218
I felt misled.

127
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,348
Now you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,

128
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:49,356
and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of

129
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:52,337
cherry-picking and selective referencing

130
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,128
that I'm accusing other people of.

131
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,012
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias

132
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:58,139
has actually been very, very well studied.

133
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,357
So here is one example of how you approach it.

134
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,797
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where

135
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,982
you know that they've been conducted and completed,

136
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,303
and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere

137
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:10,166
in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials

138
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,320
that had ever been conducted on antidepressants

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,962
that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.

140
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:19,718
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.

141
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:22,918
So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,

142
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,016
because we can never know if we have those,

143
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:28,510
but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.

144
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,859
And then they went to see if these trials had been published

145
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,431
in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.

146
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:36,600
It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,197
were positive, half of them were negative, in reality.

148
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:44,938
But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,

149
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,172
what they found was a very different picture.

150
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:51,544
Only three of the negative trials were published,

151
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:56,186
but all but one of the positive trials were published.

152
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:59,947
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two,

153
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,541
you can see what a staggering difference there was

154
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,991
between reality and what doctors, patients,

155
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,613
commissioners of health services, and academics

156
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,894
were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.

157
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:16,348
We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw

158
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:19,678
in the core of medicine.

159
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:22,341
In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on

160
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,725
publication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been

161
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,919
collected in a systematic review, published in 2010,

162
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,685
that took every single study on publication bias

163
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:32,984
that they could find.

164
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,836
Publication bias affects every field of medicine.

165
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:40,149
About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,

166
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,207
and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely

167
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:46,261
to be published as negative findings.

168
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:50,322
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.

169
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,193
If I flipped a coin 100 times but then

170
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:57,452
withheld the results from you from half of those tosses,

171
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,852
I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.

172
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,658
But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.

173
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,385
That would mean that I was a chancer

174
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:07,499
and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)

175
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:11,136
But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate

176
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:14,925
in the whole of evidence-based medicine.

177
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:19,357
And to me, this is research misconduct.

178
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:22,100
If I conducted one study and I withheld

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
half of the data points from that one study,

180
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,807
you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.

181
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,590
And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts

182
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,148
10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,

183
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,936
we don't consider that to be research misconduct.

184
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:42,503
And when that responsibility is diffused between

185
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:45,664
a whole network of researchers, academics,

186
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:49,192
industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason

187
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,645
we find it more acceptable,

188
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:54,320
but the effect on patients is damning.

189
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,338
And this is happening right now, today.

190
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:02,049
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug

191
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,645
which governments around the world have spent billions

192
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,217
and billions of dollars on stockpiling,

193
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:10,365
and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,

194
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:14,314
in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.

195
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,998
Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia

196
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:21,812
and death. (Laughter)

197
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:25,020
Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers

198
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,545
were trying to collect together all of the data from all

199
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:31,193
of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,

200
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:34,144
they found that several of those trials were unpublished.

201
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,986
The results were unavailable to them.

202
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:39,950
And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,

203
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,632
through Freedom of Information Act requests, through

204
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:46,441
harassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.

205
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:48,907
And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,

206
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:51,953
the 10,000-page long documents that have

207
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:55,553
the best possible rendition of the information,

208
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:58,441
they were told they weren't allowed to have them.

209
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,124
And if you want to read the full correspondence

210
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:04,414
and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,

211
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,131
you can see that written up in this week's edition

212
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:11,498
of PLOS Medicine.

213
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:15,357
And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,

214
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,656
is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize

215
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:22,851
that this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.

216
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,909
We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.

217
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,097
First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,

218
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:31,700
oh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,

219
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,724
they'll say what they're going to do before they do it,

220
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,845
and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which

221
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:38,313
have been conducted and completed have been published.

222
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:40,509
But people didn't bother to use those registers.

223
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,128
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,

224
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,671
and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.

225
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,304
We won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,

226
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,986
unless they've been registered before they began.

227
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:53,517
But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted

228
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:56,532
which showed that half of all of trials published by journals

229
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,199
edited by members of the ICMJE

230
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:04,012
weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.

231
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:06,813
And then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed

232
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,162
a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts

233
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,605
a trial must post the results of that trial within one year.

234
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,701
And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,

235
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,405
you can see a study which looks to see if people kept

236
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,124
to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five

237
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,988
have done so.

238
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,271
This is a disaster.

239
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:32,835
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines

240
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,051
that we prescribe if we do not have access

241
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:39,231
to all of the information.

242
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:43,190
And this is not a difficult problem to fix.

243
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,318
We need to force people to publish all trials

244
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,289
conducted in humans, including the older trials,

245
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,234
because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,

246
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,847
and I don't know what world it is in which we're only

247
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:02,303
practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.

248
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,408
We need to publish all trials in humans,

249
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,482
including the older trials, for all drugs in current use,

250
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:10,398
and you need to tell everyone you know

251
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,840
that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.

252
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,791
Thank you very much. (Applause)

253
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,064
(Applause)
