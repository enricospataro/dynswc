1
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:16,828
Well, we all need a reason to wake up.

2
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,091
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.

3
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,562
I know you're too polite to ask,

4
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,221
so I will tell you.

5
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:29,397
One night, sophomore year of college,

6
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:33,119
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,

7
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:35,795
a few of my friends and I
were horsing around,

8
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:39,384
and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train.

9
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:43,101
It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead.

10
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,227
Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time.

11
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,106
We'd certainly done stupider things.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,111
I scurried up the ladder on the back,

13
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,857
and when I stood up,

14
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,463
the electrical current entered my arm,

15
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:01,027
blew down and out my feet,
and that was that.

16
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,108
Would you believe that watch still works?

17
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,243
Takes a licking!

18
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,298
(Laughter)

19
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,631
My father wears it now in solidarity.

20
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:21,138
That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death --

21
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:24,970
and it also began
my long run as a patient.

22
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,148
It's a good word.

23
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,899
It means one who suffers.

24
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:30,086
So I guess we're all patients.

25
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:33,793
Now, the American health care system

26
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:36,938
has more than its fair share
of dysfunction --

27
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,022
to match its brilliance, to be sure.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,022
I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc,

29
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:46,292
so I've seen care from both sides.

30
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:50,795
And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare

31
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,956
really means well -- I mean, truly.

32
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:58,627
But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents

33
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,895
for a system that too often
does not serve.

34
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,976
Why?

35
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:08,825
Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question,

36
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,097
and it explains a lot:

37
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:17,079
because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center.

38
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,145
Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed.

39
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:28,030
And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking

40
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:31,389
or the opportunity
for good design more compelling

41
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:33,554
than at the end of life,

42
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,934
where things are so distilled
and concentrated.

43
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:39,840
There are no do-overs.

44
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:46,384
My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines

45
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:50,775
and invite design thinking
into this big conversation.

46
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:56,672
That is, to bring intention and creativity

47
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,465
to the experience of dying.

48
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:05,088
We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us,

49
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:09,453
before one of the few universal issues

50
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,787
as individuals as well as a civil society:

51
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:16,727
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.

52
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,899
So let's begin at the end.

53
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:27,366
For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead,

54
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,209
it's dying, suffering.

55
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,004
It's a key distinction.

56
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,449
To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful

57
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:38,827
to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is,

58
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,516
from suffering we can change.

59
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:47,373
The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal,

60
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:52,511
and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow.

61
00:03:54,833 --> 00:04:00,179
It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves.

62
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:04,042
They bring proportionality,

63
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,385
like a cosmic right-sizing.

64
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,033
After my limbs were gone,

65
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:15,643
that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed --

66
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,980
necessarily part of my life,

67
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:25,120
and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself.

68
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:29,614
It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually.

69
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,836
Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering

70
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,368
is that it is the very thing

71
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:41,795
that unites caregiver and care receiver --

72
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,072
human beings.

73
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,723
This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens.

74
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:53,013
Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday --

75
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,465
suffering together.

76
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:59,830
Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand,

77
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:03,712
so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented.

78
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,470
It serves no good purpose.

79
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:10,795
But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up,

80
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,303
well, we can change it.

81
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,155
How we die is indeed
something we can affect.

82
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:22,319
Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction

83
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:25,795
between necessary
and unnecessary suffering

84
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:29,509
gives us our first of three
design cues for the day.

85
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:34,648
After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care,

86
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:39,334
is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile.

87
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,983
True to the tenets of palliative care,

88
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:47,680
I function as something
of a reflective advocate,

89
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,823
as much as prescribing physician.

90
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:57,018
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood --

91
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,996
while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care.

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,861
It is not limited to hospice.

93
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:06,088
It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage.

94
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,858
So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon

95
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,569
to benefit from palliative care.

96
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,550
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.

97
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,803
Sort of makes this point.

98
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,857
I've been seeing Frank now for years.

99
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,075
He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV.

100
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,003
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,

101
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:32,741
but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life --

102
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,130
really, about our lives.

103
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,551
In this way, Frank grieves.

104
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:40,806
In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in,

105
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,979
so that he's ready to take in
the next moment.

106
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:49,515
Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another.

107
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:53,020
Frank has always been an adventurer --

108
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,885
he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting --

109
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,473
and no fan of regret.

110
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:01,067
So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day,

111
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,827
saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River.

112
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,637
Was this a good idea?

113
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:11,292
With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no.

114
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:14,882
Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could.

115
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,430
It was a glorious, marvelous trip:

116
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:26,070
freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes,

117
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:31,525
wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon --

118
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:35,093
all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control.

119
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:38,202
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,

120
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,513
is exactly the kind
so many of us would make,

121
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:46,734
if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time.

122
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:52,480
So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective.

123
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,795
After my accident,
when I went back to college,

124
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,185
I changed my major to art history.

125
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:04,215
Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see --

126
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,899
a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change

127
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,964
so much of what he was seeing.

128
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:16,160
Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with,

129
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,694
turning anguish into a flower.

130
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,611
Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco

131
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,874
called the Zen Hospice Project,

132
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:31,518
where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective.

133
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,286
When one of our residents dies,

134
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,780
the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden,

135
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,834
heading for the gate, we pause.

136
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,043
Anyone who wants --

137
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,791
fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers,

138
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,259
the hearse drivers too, now --

139
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:53,710
shares a story or a song or silence,

140
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,522
as we sprinkle the body
with flower petals.

141
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,406
It takes a few minutes;

142
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,795
it's a sweet, simple parting image
to usher in grief with warmth,

143
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,530
rather than repugnance.

144
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,926
Contrast that with the typical experience
in the hospital setting,

145
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,814
much like this -- floodlit room
lined with tubes and beeping machines

146
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:22,006
and blinking lights that don't stop
even when the patient's life has.

147
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,265
Cleaning crew swoops in,
the body's whisked away,

148
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:31,317
and it all feels as though that person
had never really existed.

149
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,513
Well-intended, of course,
in the name of sterility,

150
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:39,033
but hospitals tend to assault our senses,

151
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:44,561
and the most we might hope for
within those walls is numbness --

152
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,827
anesthetic, literally
the opposite of aesthetic.

153
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,624
I revere hospitals for what they can do;
I am alive because of them.

154
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,033
But we ask too much of our hospitals.

155
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:02,849
They are places for acute trauma
and treatable illness.

156
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:06,898
They are no place to live and die;
that's not what they were designed for.

157
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,198
Now mind you -- I am not
giving up on the notion

158
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:15,432
that our institutions
can become more humane.

159
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:18,258
Beauty can be found anywhere.

160
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,184
I spent a few months in a burn unit

161
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,956
at St. Barnabas Hospital
in Livingston, New Jersey,

162
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,137
where I got really
great care at every turn,

163
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,358
including good
palliative care for my pain.

164
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,080
And one night, it began to snow outside.

165
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:41,161
I remember my nurses
complaining about driving through it.

166
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:44,107
And there was no window in my room,

167
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,437
but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky.

168
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,053
Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me.

169
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:54,710
She brought it in to the unit.

170
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:01,959
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand,

171
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:05,032
and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin;

172
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:07,366
the miracle of it all,

173
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,149
the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water.

174
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:17,244
In that moment,

175
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:21,756
just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me

176
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,879
than whether I lived or died.

177
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:27,026
That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed

178
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,255
to both try to live
and be OK if I did not.

179
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:33,880
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.

180
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:39,565
In my work over the years,
I've known many people

181
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:41,416
who were ready to go, ready to die.

182
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:47,795
Not because they had found
some final peace or transcendence,

183
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:52,128
but because they were so repulsed
by what their lives had become --

184
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:58,922
in a word, cut off, or ugly.

185
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:09,300
There are already record numbers of us
living with chronic and terminal illness,

186
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:10,776
and into ever older age.

187
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:16,567
And we are nowhere near ready
or prepared for this silver tsunami.

188
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,416
We need an infrastructure
dynamic enough to handle

189
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,504
these seismic shifts in our population.

190
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,477
Now is the time to create
something new, something vital.

191
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,861
I know we can because we have to.

192
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,907
The alternative is just unacceptable.

193
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,353
And the key ingredients are known:

194
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:41,051
policy, education and training,

195
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,137
systems, bricks and mortar.

196
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:48,268
We have tons of input
for designers of all stripes to work with.

197
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,824
We know, for example, from research

198
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:54,334
what's most important to people
who are closer to death:

199
00:12:54,358 --> 00:13:01,323
comfort; feeling unburdened
and unburdening to those they love;

200
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:06,589
existential peace; and a sense
of wonderment and spirituality.

201
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:12,474
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,

202
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:16,141
we've learned much more
from our residents in subtle detail.

203
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,947
Little things aren't so little.

204
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,493
Take Janette.

205
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:26,004
She finds it harder to breathe
one day to the next due to ALS.

206
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,178
Well, guess what?

207
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,319
She wants to start smoking again --

208
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,271
and French cigarettes, if you please.

209
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,829
Not out of some self-destructive bent,

210
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:42,812
but to feel her lungs filled
while she has them.

211
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:45,803
Priorities change.

212
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,847
Or Kate -- she just wants to know

213
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,906
her dog Austin is lying
at the foot of her bed,

214
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,647
his cold muzzle against her dry skin,

215
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,394
instead of more chemotherapy
coursing through her veins --

216
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:01,599
she's done that.

217
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:07,685
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
where in a moment, in an instant,

218
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,061
we are rewarded for just being.

219
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:19,475
So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses,

220
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:24,791
by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying.

221
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,637
Probably the most poignant room

222
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,914
in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen,

223
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,975
which is a little strange when you realize

224
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:35,812
that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all.

225
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:41,706
But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels:

226
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,796
smell, a symbolic plane.

227
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:51,093
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
happening under our roof,

228
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:54,851
one of the most tried and true
interventions we know of,

229
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,368
is to bake cookies.

230
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:11,568
As long as we have our senses --

231
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,604
even just one --

232
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:17,037
we have at least
the possibility of accessing

233
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:20,229
what makes us feel human, connected.

234
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:25,605
Imagine the ripples of this notion

235
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,414
for the millions of people
living and dying with dementia.

236
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:33,639
Primal sensorial delights that say
the things we don't have words for,

237
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:36,537
impulses that make us stay present --

238
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,366
no need for a past or a future.

239
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,294
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
of the system was our first design cue,

240
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,083
then tending to dignity
by way of the senses,

241
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:56,899
by way of the body --
the aesthetic realm --

242
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,780
is design cue number two.

243
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:03,570
Now this gets us quickly to the third
and final bit for today;

244
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:10,458
namely, we need to lift our sights,
to set our sights on well-being,

245
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:13,795
so that life and health and healthcare

246
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,204
can become about making life
more wonderful,

247
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:18,672
rather than just less horrible.

248
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,172
Beneficence.

249
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,954
Here, this gets right at the distinction

250
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:30,112
between a disease-centered and a patient-
or human-centered model of care,

251
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:33,597
and here is where caring
becomes a creative, generative,

252
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,463
even playful act.

253
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:38,477
"Play" may sound like a funny word here.

254
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:42,411
But it is also one of our
highest forms of adaptation.

255
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:47,094
Consider every major compulsory effort
it takes to be human.

256
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:49,621
The need for food has birthed cuisine.

257
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,233
The need for shelter
has given rise to architecture.

258
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,463
The need for cover, fashion.

259
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:57,218
And for being subjected to the clock,

260
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:00,769
well, we invented music.

261
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,795
So, since dying
is a necessary part of life,

262
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,450
what might we create with this fact?

263
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:15,250
By "play" I am in no way suggesting
we take a light approach to dying

264
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,913
or that we mandate
any particular way of dying.

265
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,795
There are mountains of sorrow
that cannot move,

266
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,886
and one way or another,
we will all kneel there.

267
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,320
Rather, I am asking that we make space --

268
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:34,087
physical, psychic room, to allow life
to play itself all the way out --

269
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:37,468
so that rather than just
getting out of the way,

270
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:42,309
aging and dying can become
a process of crescendo through to the end.

271
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,592
We can't solve for death.

272
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,410
I know some of you are working on this.

273
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:56,109
(Laughter)

274
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,635
Meanwhile, we can --

275
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,675
(Laughter)

276
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,005
We can design towards it.

277
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,237
Parts of me died early on,

278
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:08,025
and that's something we can all say
one way or another.

279
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,044
I got to redesign my life
around this fact,

280
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,408
and I tell you it has been a liberation

281
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:17,587
to realize you can always find
a shock of beauty or meaning

282
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,878
in what life you have left,

283
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,666
like that snowball lasting
for a perfect moment,

284
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,988
all the while melting away.

285
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,539
If we love such moments ferociously,

286
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,835
then maybe we can learn to live well --

287
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,946
not in spite of death,

288
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,556
but because of it.

289
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,516
Let death be what takes us,

290
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,402
not lack of imagination.

291
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:49,840
Thank you.

292
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:57,784
(Applause)
