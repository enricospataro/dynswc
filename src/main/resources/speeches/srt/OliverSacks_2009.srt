1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
We see with the eyes,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
but we see with the brain as well.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,820
our inscapes. We've lived with them all our lives.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,820
But there are also hallucinations as well,

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
and hallucinations are completely different.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
They don't seem to be of our creation.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
They don't seem to be under our control.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
They seem to come from the outside,

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
and to mimic perception.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,820
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations,

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,820
and a particular sort of visual hallucination

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
which I see among my patients.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,820
A few months ago, I got a phone call

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
from a nursing home where I work.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
was seeing things,

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
or, because she was an old lady,

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,820
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie,

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
the old lady.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
I went in to see her.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
It was evident straight away

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
that she was perfectly sane

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
and lucid and of good intelligence,

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,820
but she'd been very startled and very bewildered,

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
because she'd been seeing things.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
And she told me --

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
the nurses hadn't mentioned this --

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
that she was blind,

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,820
that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
But now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
So I said, "What sort of things?"

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
And she said, "People in Eastern dress,

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,820
in drapes, walking up and down stairs.

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
A man who turns towards me and smiles.

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,820
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Animals too.

41
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
I see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,820
I see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
Then, one night, the scene changes.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
They come to a certain point and then stop.

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Then it changes again.

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
They wear bright colors, rose and blue,

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
like Eastern dress."

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Sometimes, she said, before the people come on,

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
which seem to go up to the ceiling.

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,820
I said, "Is this like a dream?"

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
And she said, "No, it's not like a dream. It's like a movie."

55
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion.

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie."

57
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
And she said that it's a rather boring movie.

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress,

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,820
walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."

60
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
(Laughter)

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
And she has a sense of humor.

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
She knew it was a hallucination.

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
But she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years

64
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
and she'd never had a hallucination before.

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated

66
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,820
to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing,

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,820
that they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.

68
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
She had no control over them.

69
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
She said she didn't recognize

70
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
any of the people or places

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
in the hallucinations.

72
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And none of the people or the animals,

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,820
well, they all seemed oblivious of her.

74
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
And she didn't know what was going on.

75
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
She wondered if she was going mad

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
or losing her mind.

77
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Well, I examined her carefully.

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
She was a bright old lady,

79
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,820
perfectly sane. She had no medical problems.

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.

81
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
But she was blind.

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And I then said to her,

83
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
"I think I know what you have."

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,820
I said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination

85
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.

86
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
This was originally described," I said,

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
"right back in the 18th century,

88
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
by a man called Charles Bonnet.

89
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

90
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

92
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
And she was very relieved at this,

93
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,820
that there was nothing seriously the matter,

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
and also rather curious.

95
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
She said, "Did he have them himself?"

97
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
And she said, "Tell all the nurses

98
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

99
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
(Laughter)

100
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

101
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Well, so I did tell the nurses.

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Now this, for me, is a common situation.

103
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
I work in old-age homes, largely.

104
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
I see a lot of elderly people

105
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,820
who are hearing impaired or visually impaired.

106
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people

107
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
get musical hallucinations.

108
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people

109
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
get visual hallucinations.

110
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
You don't have to be completely blind,

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
only sufficiently impaired.

112
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Now with the original description in the 18th century,

113
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Charles Bonnet did not have them.

114
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
His grandfather had these hallucinations.

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.

116
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
He'd had cataract surgery.

117
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
His vision was pretty poor.

118
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,820
And in 1759, he described to his grandson

119
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
various things he was seeing.

120
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
The first thing he said was he saw

121
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
a handkerchief in midair.

122
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
It was a large blue handkerchief

123
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
with four orange circles.

124
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
And he knew it was a hallucination.

125
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.

126
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.

127
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not,

128
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
because the hallucinations would fit

129
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
in the context of the visions.

130
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
So on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them,

131
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,820
he said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"

132
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."

133
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,820
And then the handsome young men disappeared.

134
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
It's typical of these hallucinations

135
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.

136
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
They don't usually fade in and out.

137
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.

138
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Charles Lullin, the grandfather,

139
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
saw hundreds of different figures,

140
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
different landscapes of all sorts.

141
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,820
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,

142
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
and realized it was himself.

143
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
That was the only figure he recognized.

144
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,820
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris,

145
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.

146
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
But when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding

147
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,820
six inches high, on his study table.

148
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
This repetition of perception

149
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
is sometimes called palinopsia.

150
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,820
With him and with Rosalie,

151
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
what seems to be going on --

152
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --

153
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
and I said that as you lose vision,

154
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,

155
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
they become hyperactive and excitable,

156
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
and they start to fire spontaneously.

157
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
And you start to see things.

158
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
The things you see can be very complicated indeed.

159
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,820
With another patient of mine,

160
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
who, also had some vision,

161
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
the vision she had could be disturbing.

162
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
On one occasion, she said she saw

163
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.

164
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
And he turned around. And then

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
he divided into six figures in striped shirts,

166
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
who started walking towards her.

167
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
And then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Once, when she was driving,

169
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
or rather, her husband was driving,

170
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
the road divided into four

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.

172
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,820
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.

173
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
A lot of them had to do with a car.

174
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy

175
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
sitting on the hood of the car.

176
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully

177
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
when the car turned.

178
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And then when they came to a stop,

179
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air,

180
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
and then disappear.

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.

182
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes,

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
but the visual parts of her brain,

184
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
a little tumor in the occipital cortex.

185
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And, above all, she would see cartoons.

186
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,820
These cartoons would be transparent

187
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
and would cover half the visual field, like a screen.

188
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,820
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.

189
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
(Laughter)

190
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,

191
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
but she made a point of saying,

192
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,820
"Why Kermit?" She said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.

193
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.

194
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Why Kermit?

195
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

196
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.

197
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,820
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent

198
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
images or hallucinations of faces

199
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,

200
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
with very large teeth or very large eyes.

201
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
And these frightened her.

202
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Well, what is going on with these people?

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on,

204
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
and to reassure people,

205
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,820
especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.

206
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Something like 10 percent, as I said,

207
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
of visually impaired people get these.

208
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,820
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,

209
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.

210
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And if they do mention them to their own doctors

211
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
they may be misdiagnosed.

212
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
In particular, the notion is that if you see

213
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
things or hear things, you're going mad,

214
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.

215
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,

216
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
they address you. They accuse you.

217
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
They seduce you. They humiliate you.

218
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
They jeer at you.

219
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
You interact with them.

220
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
There is none of this quality of being addressed

221
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.

222
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,820
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you,

223
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
or that's how people think about it.

224
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy,

225
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
and sometimes, if one has this,

226
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
one may feel oneself transported back

227
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
to a time and place in the past.

228
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
You're at a particular road junction.

229
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You smell chestnuts roasting.

230
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.

231
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
And you're waiting for your girl.

232
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,820
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.

233
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
And the temporal lobe hallucinations

234
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
are all-sense hallucinations,

235
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
full of feeling, full of familiarity,

236
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
located in space and time,

237
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
coherent, dramatic.

238
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.

239
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,820
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,

240
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
you have all sorts of levels,

241
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
from the geometrical hallucinations --

242
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
the pink and blue squares the woman had --

243
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
up to quite elaborate hallucinations

244
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
with figures and especially faces.

245
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,

246
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
are the single commonest thing

247
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
in these hallucinations.

248
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.

249
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
So, what is going on?

250
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Fascinatingly, in the last few years,

251
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
it's been possible to do functional brain imagery,

252
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.

253
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
And in fact, to find that different parts

254
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
of the visual brain are activated

255
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
as they are hallucinating.

256
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations,

257
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
the primary visual cortex is activated.

258
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.

259
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,820
You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.

260
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
When images are formed,

261
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
a higher part of the visual cortex

262
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
is involved in the temporal lobe.

263
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,820
And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe

264
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
is called the fusiform gyrus.

265
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,820
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus,

266
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.

267
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus,

268
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
they may hallucinate faces,

269
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.

270
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,820
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus

271
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,820
where teeth and eyes are represented,

272
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
and that part of the gyrus is activated

273
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,820
when people get the deformed hallucinations.

274
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
There is another part of the brain

275
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
which is especially activated

276
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
when one sees cartoons.

277
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons,

278
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,820
when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.

279
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
It's very interesting that that should be specific.

280
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved

281
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
with the recognition and hallucination

282
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
of buildings and landscapes.

283
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,

284
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
but particular cells.

285
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,820
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.

286
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
And now we know that there are hundreds of other

287
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
sorts of cells,

288
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
which can be very, very specific.

289
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
So you may not only have

290
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
"car" cells,

291
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
you may have "Aston Martin" cells.

292
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
(Laughter)

293
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.

294
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I had to bring it in.

295
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
And now it's in there somewhere.

296
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
(Laughter)

297
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex,

298
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
there are only visual images,

299
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
or figments or fragments.

300
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
It's only at higher levels

301
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
that the other senses join in

302
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
and there are connections with memory and emotion.

303
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,

304
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
you don't go to those higher levels.

305
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex

306
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
where you have thousands and tens of thousands

307
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
and millions of images,

308
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
or figments, or fragmentary figments,

309
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
all neurally encoded

310
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,820
in particular cells or small clusters of cells.

311
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Normally these are all part of

312
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,820
the integrated stream of perception, or imagination,

313
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
and one is not conscious of them.

314
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind

315
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
that the process is interrupted.

316
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
And instead of getting normal perception,

317
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
you're getting an anarchic,

318
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
convulsive stimulation, or release,

319
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
of all of these visual cells

320
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
in the inferotemporal cortex.

321
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
So, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.

322
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.

323
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
The mind does its best to organize

324
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
and to give some sort of coherence to this,

325
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
but not terribly successfully.

326
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
When these were first described,

327
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.

328
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
But in fact people say,

329
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
"I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations."

330
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
"Kermit means nothing to me."

331
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,820
You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.

332
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.

333
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
I think I just want to recapitulate

334
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
and say this is common.

335
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Think of the number of blind people.

336
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people

337
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
who have these hallucinations,

338
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
but are too scared to mention them.

339
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into

340
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,820
notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.

341
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Finally, I think they are

342
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
infinitely interesting and valuable,

343
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,820
for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.

344
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --

345
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations,

346
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
how, as he put it, the theater of the mind

347
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
could be generated by the machinery of the brain.

348
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Now, 250 years later,

349
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.

350
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Thanks very much.

351
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
(Applause)

352
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Chris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.

353
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
You speak about these things with so much insight

354
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
and empathy for your patients.

355
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?

356
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.

357
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
(Laughter)

358
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Well, yeah, a lot of them.

359
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,820
And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.

360
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.

361
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,820
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.

362
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
But they stop there.

363
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
CA: And they don't disturb you?

364
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?

365
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,820
OS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus,

366
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
which I ignore.

367
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
They occasionally interest me,

368
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.

369
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
I've gone and had an fMRI myself,

370
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,820
to see how my visual cortex is taking over.

371
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,820
And when I see all these hexagons

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
and complex things, which I also have,

373
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
in visual migraine,

374
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
I wonder whether everyone sees things like this,

375
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
and whether things like cave art or ornamental art

376
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
may have been derived from them a bit.

377
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
CA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.

378
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Thank you so much for sharing.

379
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
OS: Thank you. Thank you.

380
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
(Applause)
