1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
It feels like we're all suffering

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
from information overload or data glut.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
and that's using our eyes more.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
So, visualizing information, so that we can see

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
the patterns and connections that matter

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
or it tells a story,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
So, let's see.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
and this image arose

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
out of frustration I had

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
That is, they're meaningless without context:

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
500 billion for this pipeline,

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
20 billion for this war.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
is visually and relatively.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
So I scraped a load of reported figures

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
from various news outlets

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
So purple is "fighting,"

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
And what you can see straight away

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
You can literally see them.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
But more importantly, you start to see

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
patterns and connections between numbers

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
Let me point out some that I really like.

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
780 billion a year.

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
that's their climate change fund.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Americans, incredibly generous people --

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
compared with the amount of foreign aid

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
given by the top 17 industrialized nations

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
at 120 billion.

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Then of course,

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
back in 2003.

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
to 3,000 billion.

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
So now it's great

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
by the debt that Africa owes to the West?

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Let's take a look.

54
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
So there it is:

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
227 billion is what Africa owes.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
And the recent financial crisis,

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
how much of this diagram might that figure take up?

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect

60
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
for that much money:

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
11,900 billion.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
So, by visualizing this information,

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
we turned it into a landscape

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
that you can explore with your eyes,

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
a kind of map really, a sort of information map.

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And when you're lost in information,

67
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
an information map is kind of useful.

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
So I want to show you another landscape now.

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
We need to imagine what a landscape

70
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
of the world's fears might look like.

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Let's take a look.

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
This is Mountains Out of Molehills,

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
a timeline of global media panic.

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
(Laughter)

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
So, I'll label this for you in a second.

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
But the height here, I want to point out,

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
is the intensity of certain fears

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
as reported in the media.

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
Let me point them out.

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,820
So this, swine flu -- pink.

81
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
Bird flu.

82
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
The millennium bug,

84
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
terrible disaster.

85
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
These little green peaks

86
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
are asteroid collisions.

87
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
(Laughter)

88
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And in summer, here, killer wasps.

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,820
(Laughter)

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
So these are what our fears look like

91
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
over time in our media.

92
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist --

93
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.

94
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
that you can only see when you visualize it.

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Let me highlight it for you.

97
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.

98
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,

99
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
twin peaks every year.

100
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
at the same month every year.

102
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Why?

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Well, November, Christmas video games come out,

104
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,820
and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.

105
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
But April isn't a particularly massive month

106
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
for video games.

107
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Why April?

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
and since then, that fear

110
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
has been remembered by the media

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
You have retrospectives, anniversaries,

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
court cases, even copy-cat shootings,

114
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
all pushing that fear into the agenda.

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?

116
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
See that gap there? There's a gap,

117
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
and it affects all the other stories.

118
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Why is there a gap there?

119
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
You see where it starts? September 2001,

120
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
when we had something very real

121
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
to be scared about.

122
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,

123
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
and I keep hearing a phrase

124
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
all the time, which is this:

125
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
"Data is the new oil."

126
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource

127
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,

128
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.

129
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,

130
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
and I would say that data is the new soil.

133
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.

134
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Over the years, online,

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
we've laid down

136
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
a huge amount of information and data,

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,

138
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.

139
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.

140
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
But it's a really fertile medium,

141
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.

143
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
But if you look at it directly,

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.

145
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.

147
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Let me show you this.

148
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Can you guess what this data set is?

149
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
What rises twice a year,

150
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
once in Easter

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
and then two weeks before Christmas,

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
has a mini peak every Monday,

153
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
and then flattens out over the summer?

154
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
I'll take answers.

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.

156
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
You might want to get some chocolate in.

157
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Any other guesses?

158
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.

159
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Yeah, retail therapy might help.

160
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
(Audience: Sick leave.)

161
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.

162
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Shall we see?

163
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:57,820
(Laughter)

164
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
(Applause)

165
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,

166
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates

167
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"

168
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
and this is the pattern we found --

169
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
people clearing out for Spring Break,

170
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,820
(Laughter)

171
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
being single over the summer,

173
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.

174
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Who would do that?

175
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
So there's a titanic amount of data out there now,

176
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
unprecedented.

177
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
But if you ask the right kind of question,

178
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
or you work it in the right kind of way,

179
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
interesting things can emerge.

180
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.

181
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.

182
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And here's my visual C.V.

183
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.

184
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.

185
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
But I wanted to convey something to you.

186
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
I started as a programmer,

187
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,

188
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
in print, online and then in advertising,

189
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
and only recently have I started designing.

190
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
And I've never been to design school.

191
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
I've never studied art or anything.

192
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
I just kind of learned through doing.

193
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
And when I started designing,

194
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I discovered an odd thing about myself.

195
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
I already knew how to design,

196
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,

197
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
but more like I was sensitive

198
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
to the ideas of grids and space

199
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
and alignment and typography.

200
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
It's almost like being exposed

201
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
to all this media over the years

202
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.

203
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And I don't feel like I'm unique.

204
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
I feel that everyday, all of us now

205
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
are being blasted by information design.

206
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web,

207
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
and we're all visualizers now;

208
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
we're all demanding a visual aspect

209
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
to our information.

210
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.

211
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
It's effortless, it literally pours in.

212
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
And if you're navigating a dense information jungle,

213
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
coming across a beautiful graphic

214
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
or a lovely data visualization,

215
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.

216
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
I was curious about this, so it led me

217
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
to the work of a Danish physicist

218
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
called Tor Norretranders,

219
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.

220
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So here we go. This is your senses,

221
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
pouring into your senses every second.

222
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Your sense of sight is the fastest.

223
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.

224
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.

225
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
And then you have hearing and smell,

226
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
which has the throughput of a hard disk.

227
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
And then you have poor old taste,

228
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.

229
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,

230
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
that's the amount we're actually aware of.

231
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
So a lot of your vision --

232
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.

233
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
It's unconscious.

234
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
The eye is exquisitely sensitive

235
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.

236
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
It's the language of the eye.

238
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,

239
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
which is about words and numbers and concepts,

240
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
you start speaking two languages simultaneously,

241
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
each enhancing the other.

242
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.

243
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
And that whole thing -- it's two languages

244
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
both working at the same time.

245
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like,

246
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
to alter our perspective or change our views.

247
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Let me ask you a simple question

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
with a really simple answer:

249
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Who has the biggest military budget?

250
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
It's got to be America, right?

251
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 --

252
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
607, rather.

253
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
So massive, in fact, that it can contain

254
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
all the other military budgets in the world inside itself.

255
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

256
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there

257
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.

258
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
So that might well chime

259
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
with your view that America

260
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
is a sort of warmongering military machine,

261
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
out to overpower the world

262
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
with its huge industrial-military complex.

263
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?

264
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Because America is an incredibly rich country.

265
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
In fact, it's so massively rich

266
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
that it can contain the four other

267
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
top industrialized nations' economies

268
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
inside itself, it's so vastly rich.

269
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.

270
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,

271
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
we have to bring in another data set,

272
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
and that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.

273
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?

274
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Let's have a look.

275
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
That changes the picture considerably.

276
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,

277
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
and American drops into eighth.

278
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Now you can also do this with soldiers.

279
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.

280
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Of course, 2.1 million.

281
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Again, chiming with your view

282
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
that China has a militarized regime

283
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.

284
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
But of course, China has an enormous population.

285
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
So if we do the same,

286
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
we see a radically different picture.

287
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
China drops to 124th.

288
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
It actually has a tiny army

289
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
when you take other data into consideration.

290
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
So, absolute figures, like the military budget,

291
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
in a connected world,

292
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
don't give you the whole picture.

293
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
They're not as true as they could be.

294
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
We need relative figures that are connected to other data

295
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
so that we can see a fuller picture,

296
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.

297
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
As Hans Rosling, the master,

298
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
my master, said,

299
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
"Let the dataset change your mindset."

300
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.

301
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Take a look at this one.

302
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
I'm a bit of a health nut.

303
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
I love taking supplements and being fit,

304
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.

305
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
There's always conflicting evidence.

306
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?

307
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
This is a visualization of all the evidence

308
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
for nutritional supplements.

309
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.

310
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
So the higher up the image,

311
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
the more evidence there is for each supplement.

312
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.

313
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
So you can immediately apprehend

314
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
the relationship between efficacy and popularity,

315
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
but you can also, if you grade the evidence,

316
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
do a "worth it" line.

317
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
So supplements above this line are worth investigating,

318
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
but only for the conditions listed below,

319
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
and then the supplements below the line

320
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
are perhaps not worth investigating.

321
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.

322
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,

323
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
the biomedical database,

324
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
and we compiled them and graded them all.

325
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
And it was incredibly frustrating for me

326
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,

327
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
and I spent a month doing this,

328
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
and I only filled two pages.

329
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
But what it points to

330
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
is that visualizing information like this

331
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
is a form of knowledge compression.

332
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount

333
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
of information and understanding

334
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
into a small space.

335
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,

336
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
and once it's there,

337
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
you can do cool stuff like this.

338
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
So I converted this into an interactive app,

339
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
so I can now generate this application online --

340
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
this is the visualization online --

341
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."

342
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
So it spawns itself.

343
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff

344
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
that affects heart health."

345
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
So let's filter that out.

346
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.

347
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,

348
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
I just want to see plants and --

349
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."

350
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Now this app is spawning itself

351
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
from the data.

352
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
The data is all stored in a Google Doc,

353
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and it's literally generating itself from that data.

354
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
So the data is now alive; this is a living image,

355
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
and I can update it in a second.

356
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.

357
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,820
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.

358
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
So it's cool.

359
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
It's kind of living.

360
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
But it can go beyond data,

361
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
and it can go beyond numbers.

362
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I like to apply information visualization

363
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
to ideas and concepts.

364
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
This is a visualization

365
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
of the political spectrum,

366
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
an attempt for me to try

367
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
and understand how it works

368
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
and how the ideas percolate down

369
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
from government into society and culture,

370
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
into families, into individuals, into their beliefs

371
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
and back around again in a cycle.

372
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
What I love about this image

373
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
is it's made up of concepts,

374
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
it explores our worldviews

375
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --

376
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
to see what others think,

377
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
to see where they're coming from.

378
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that.

379
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
What was most exciting for me

380
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
designing this

381
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
was that, when I was designing this image,

382
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
I desperately wanted this side, the left side,

383
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
to be better than the right side --

384
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --

385
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
but I couldn't, because I would have created

386
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
a lopsided, biased diagram.

387
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
So, in order to really create a full image,

388
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side

389
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize

390
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
how many of those qualities were actually in me,

391
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.

392
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,820
(Laughter)

393
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
But not too uncomfortable,

394
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
because there's something unthreatening

395
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
about seeing a political perspective,

396
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
versus being told or forced to listen to one.

397
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints

398
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
joyously when you can see them.

399
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
It's even fun to engage with them

400
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
because it's visual.

401
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
So that's what's exciting to me,

402
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
seeing how data can change my perspective

403
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
and change my mind midstream --

404
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
beautiful, lovely data.

405
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
So, just to wrap up,

406
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I wanted to say

407
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
that it feels to me that design is about solving problems

408
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
and providing elegant solutions,

409
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
and information design is about

410
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
solving information problems.

411
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
It feels like we have a lot of information problems

412
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
in our society at the moment,

413
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
from the overload and the saturation

414
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
to the breakdown of trust and reliability

415
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,

416
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
or even just interestingness.

417
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
I mean, I find information just too interesting.

418
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in.

419
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
So, visualizing information

420
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.

421
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Even when the information is terrible,

422
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
the visual can be quite beautiful.

423
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Often we can get clarity

424
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
or the answer to a simple question very quickly,

425
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
like this one,

426
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
the recent Icelandic volcano.

427
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Which was emitting the most CO2?

428
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Was it the planes or the volcano,

429
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
the grounded planes or the volcano?

430
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
So we can have a look.

431
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
We look at the data and we see:

432
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;

433
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
the grounded planes would have emitted

434
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
345,000 if they were in the sky.

435
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano.

436
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
(Laughter)

437
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,820
(Applause)

438
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
And that is beautiful. Thank you.

439
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:07,820
(Applause)
