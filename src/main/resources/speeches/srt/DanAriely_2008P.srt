1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,796
I'll tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,701
Not yours, of course -- other people's.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,907
(Laughter)

4
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:21,796
So after being at MIT for a few years,

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,477
I realized that writing academic papers
is not that exciting.

6
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,859
You know, I don't know
how many of those you read,

7
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:31,418
but it's not fun to read
and often not fun to write --

8
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:32,796
even worse to write.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,796
So I decided to try and write
something more fun.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,267
And I came up with an idea
that I would write a cookbook.

11
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:42,783
And the title for my cookbook
was going to be,

12
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:45,667
"Dining Without Crumbs:
The Art of Eating Over the Sink."

13
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,413
(Laughter)

14
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:50,342
And it was going to be a look
at life through the kitchen.

15
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,921
I was quite excited about this.

16
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:54,214
I was going to talk
a little bit about research,

17
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,735
a little bit about the kitchen.

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,878
We do so much in the kitchen,
I thought this would be interesting.

19
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:02,794
I wrote a couple of chapters,
and took it to MIT Press and they said,

20
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:05,912
"Cute, but not for us.
Go and find somebody else."

21
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:08,817
I tried other people,
and everybody said the same thing,

22
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:10,912
"Cute. Not for us."

23
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,796
Until somebody said,

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,646
"Look, if you're serious about this,

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,201
you have to write about your research
first; you have to publish something,

26
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,923
then you'll get the opportunity
to write something else.

27
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:24,218
If you really want to do it,
you have to do it."

28
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:26,587
I said, "I don't want to write
about my research.

29
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,828
I do it all day long,

30
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:31,344
I want to write something
a bit more free, less constrained."

31
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,796
And this person
was very forceful and said,

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,396
"Look, that's the only way
you'll ever do it."

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,730
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --"

34
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:39,913
I had a sabbatical.

35
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:42,896
I said, "I'll write about my research,
if there's no other way.

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,722
And then I'll get to do my cookbook."

37
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:47,982
So, I wrote a book on my research.

38
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,577
And it turned out to be
quite fun in two ways.

39
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,125
First of all, I enjoyed writing.

40
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:56,903
But the more interesting thing
was that I started learning from people.

41
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:58,512
It's a fantastic time to write,

42
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:01,241
because there's so much feedback
you can get from people.

43
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,796
People write to me
about their personal experience,

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,154
and about their examples,
and where they disagree,

45
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:07,796
and their nuances.

46
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,106
And even being here --
I mean, the last few days,

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,796
I've known heights of obsessive behavior

48
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,796
I never thought about.

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,452
(Laughter)

50
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,368
Which I think is just fascinating.

51
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,987
I will tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior,

52
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,189
and I want to start by giving you
some examples of visual illusion

53
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,146
as a metaphor for rationality.

54
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,988
So think about these two tables.

55
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:29,796
And you must have seen this illusion.

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,641
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical
line on the table on the left,

57
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:36,458
or the horizontal line
on the table on the right,

58
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,796
which one seems longer?

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,795
Can anybody see anything
but the left one being longer?

60
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,666
No, right? It's impossible.

61
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,582
But the nice thing about visual illusion
is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.

62
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:50,069
So I can put some lines
on; it doesn't help.

63
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,795
I can animate the lines.

64
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,487
And to the extent you believe
I didn't shrink the lines,

65
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,299
which I didn't, I've proven to you
that your eyes were deceiving you.

66
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:02,796
Now, the interesting thing about this
is when I take the lines away,

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,630
it's as if you haven't learned
anything in the last minute.

68
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,874
(Laughter)

69
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:11,589
You can't look at this and say,
"Now I see reality as it is."

70
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,653
Right? It's impossible to overcome
this sense that this is indeed longer.

71
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:17,304
Our intuition is really fooling us

72
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,475
in a repeatable,
predictable, consistent way.

73
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,796
and there is almost nothing
we can do about it,

74
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,796
aside from taking a ruler
and starting to measure it.

75
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,994
Here's another one.
It's one of my favorite illusions.

76
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,707
What color is the top arrow pointing to?

77
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,951
Audience: Brown.
Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.

78
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,944
The bottom one? Yellow.

79
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,309
Turns out they're identical.

80
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,244
Can anybody see them as identical?

81
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,642
Very, very hard.

82
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,796
I can cover the rest of the cube up.

83
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,226
If I cover the rest of the cube,
you can see that they are identical.

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,687
If you don't believe me,
you can get the slide later

85
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:51,527
and do some arts and crafts
and see that they're identical.

86
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,884
But again, it's the same story,
that if we take the background away,

87
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,113
the illusion comes back.

88
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,114
There is no way for us not
to see this illusion.

89
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:03,455
I guess maybe if you're colorblind,
I don't think you can see that.

90
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,796
I want you to think
about illusion as a metaphor.

91
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,955
Vision is one of the best things we do.

92
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,575
We have a huge part of our brain
dedicated to vision --

93
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,494
bigger than dedicated to anything else.

94
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,366
We use our vision more hours
of the day than anything else.

95
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,460
We're evolutionarily
designed to use vision.

96
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,460
And if we have these predictable
repeatable mistakes in vision,

97
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,990
which we're so good at,

98
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,578
what are the chances we won't make
even more mistakes

99
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:29,153
in something we're not as good at,
for example, financial decision-making.

100
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:30,796
(Laughter)

101
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,470
Something we don't have
an evolutionary reason to do,

102
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,844
we don't have a specialized
part of the brain for,

103
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,883
and we don't do that many
hours of the day.

104
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,875
The argument is in those cases,

105
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,796
it might be that we actually
make many more mistakes.

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,593
And worse -- not having
an easy way to see them,

107
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,846
because in visual illusions, we can
easily demonstrate the mistakes;

108
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,957
in cognitive illusion
it's much, much harder

109
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,796
to demonstrate the mistakes to people.

110
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,796
So I want to show you
some cognitive illusions,

111
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,902
or decision-making illusions,
in the same way.

112
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:03,402
And this is one of my favorite
plots in social sciences.

113
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:07,264
It's from a paper
by Johnson and Goldstein.

114
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,986
It basically shows the percentage
of people who indicated

115
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,740
they would be interested
in donating their organs.

116
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:16,689
These are different countries in Europe.

117
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,674
You basically see two types of countries:

118
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,300
countries on the right,
that seem to be giving a lot;

119
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:24,283
and countries on the left
that seem to giving very little,

120
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,910
or much less.

121
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,086
The question is, why?

122
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,434
Why do some countries give a lot
and some countries give a little?

123
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,086
When you ask people this question,

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,642
they usually think that it has
to be about culture.

125
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,292
How much do you care about people?

126
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,796
Giving organs to somebody else

127
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,154
is probably about how much you care
about society, how linked you are.

128
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,796
Or maybe it's about religion.

129
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,775
But if you look at this plot,

130
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,226
you can see that countries
that we think about as very similar,

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,392
actually exhibit very different behavior.

132
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,289
For example, Sweden
is all the way on the right,

133
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,972
and Denmark, which we think
is culturally very similar,

134
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,796
is all the way on the left.

135
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,796
Germany is on the left,
and Austria is on the right.

136
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,136
The Netherlands is on the left,
and Belgium is on the right.

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,796
And finally, depending
on your particular version

138
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,796
of European similarity,

139
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,986
you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,

140
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,834
but it turns out that with organ
donation, they are very different.

141
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,297
By the way, the Netherlands
is an interesting story.

142
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,940
You see, the Netherlands is kind
of the biggest of the small group.

143
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:28,796
It turns out that they got to 28 percent

144
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,099
after mailing every household
in the country a letter,

145
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,796
begging people to join
this organ donation program.

146
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:38,300
You know the expression,
"Begging only gets you so far."

147
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:40,796
It's 28 percent in organ donation.

148
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,689
(Laughter)

149
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:45,443
But whatever the countries
on the right are doing,

150
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,578
they're doing a much
better job than begging.

151
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:48,910
So what are they doing?

152
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:52,402
Turns out the secret has to do
with a form at the DMV.

153
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:53,796
And here is the story.

154
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,327
The countries on the left
have a form at the DMV

155
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,042
that looks something like this.

156
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:02,351
"Check the box below if you want to
participate in the organ donor program."

157
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,796
And what happens?

158
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,129
People don't check, and they don't join.

159
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,322
The countries on the right,
the ones that give a lot,

160
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,948
have a slightly different form.

161
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,472
It says, "Check the box below
if you don't want to participate ..."

162
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:16,686
Interestingly enough,
when people get this,

163
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,796
they again don't check, but now they join.

164
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,796
(Laughter)

165
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,732
Now, think about what this means.

166
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:28,796
You know, we wake up in the morning
and we feel we make decisions.

167
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,130
We wake up in the morning
and we open the closet;

168
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:32,938
we feel that we decide what to wear.

169
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:36,034
we open the refrigerator and we feel
that we decide what to eat.

170
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,557
What this is actually saying,

171
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,391
is that many of these decisions
are not residing within us.

172
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,192
They are residing in the person
who is designing that form.

173
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,487
When you walk into the DMV,

174
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:48,510
the person who designed the form
will have a huge influence

175
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,343
on what you'll end up doing.

176
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,146
Now, it's also very hard
to intuit these results.

177
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,511
Think about it for yourself.

178
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:55,796
How many of you believe

179
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,106
that if you went to renew
your license tomorrow,

180
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,796
and you went to the DMV,

181
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,087
and you encountered one of these forms,

182
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,572
that it would actually
change your own behavior?

183
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,903
Very hard to think
that it would influence us.

184
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:10,466
We can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans,
of course it would influence them."

185
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,253
But when it comes to us,

186
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:14,915
we have such a feeling
that we're in the driver's seat,

187
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,228
such a feeling that we're in control
and we are making the decision,

188
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,851
that it's very hard
to even accept the idea

189
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,550
that we actually have an illusion
of making a decision,

190
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:25,638
rather than an actual decision.

191
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:28,130
Now, you might say,

192
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,571
"These are decisions we don't care about."

193
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,868
In fact, by definition,
these are decisions

194
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,475
about something that will happen
to us after we die.

195
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:37,619
How could we care about something less

196
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,932
than about something
that happens after we die?

197
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:42,878
So a standard economist,
somebody who believes in rationality,

198
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,155
would say, "You know what?

199
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,631
The cost of lifting the pencil
and marking a "V" is higher

200
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,796
than the possible benefit of the decision,

201
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,618
so that's why we get this effect."

202
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:52,651
(Laughter)

203
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:55,173
But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.

204
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:58,213
It's not because it's trivial.
It's not because we don't care.

205
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,658
It's the opposite. It's because we care.

206
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,626
It's difficult and it's complex.

207
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,201
And it's so complex
that we don't know what to do.

208
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,201
And because we have no idea what to do,

209
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,796
we just pick whatever it was
that was chosen for us.

210
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,970
I'll give you one more example.

211
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:15,581
This is from a paper
by Redelmeier and Shafir.

212
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:19,111
And they said, "Would this
effect also happens to experts?

213
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:22,263
People who are well-paid,
experts in their decisions,

214
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,643
and who make a lot of them?"

215
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,852
And they took a group of physicians.

216
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,328
They presented to them
a case study of a patient.

217
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:31,796
They said, "Here is a patient.
He is a 67-year-old farmer.

218
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,550
He's been suffering from
right hip pain for a while."

219
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,408
And then, they said to the physicians,

220
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,796
"You decided a few weeks ago

221
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,796
that nothing is working for this patient.

222
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,249
All these medications,
nothing seems to be working.

223
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:45,045
So you refer the patient
for hip replacement therapy.

224
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:46,796
Hip replacement. Okay?"

225
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,795
So the patient is on a path
to have his hip replaced.

226
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,245
Then they said to half of the physicians,

227
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,608
"Yesterday, you reviewed
the patient's case,

228
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,242
and you realized that you forgot
to try one medication.

229
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,862
You did not try ibuprofen.

230
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,145
What do you do? Do you pull
the patient back and try ibuprofen?

231
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,939
Or do you let him go
and have hip replacement?"

232
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:08,614
Well, the good news is
that most physicians in this case

233
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:11,447
decided to pull the patient
and try ibuprofen.

234
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,211
Very good for the physicians.

235
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,302
To the other group
of physicians, they said,

236
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:19,175
"Yesterday when you reviewed the case,
you discovered there were two medications

237
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,715
you didn't try out yet --
ibuprofen and piroxicam."

238
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,990
You have two medications
you didn't try out yet.

239
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,657
What do you do? You let him go,
or you pull him back?

240
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:30,125
And if you pull him back, do you try
ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"

241
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,305
Now, think of it:

242
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,201
This decision makes it as easy to let
the patient continue with hip replacement,

243
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:38,351
but pulling him back, all of the sudden
it becomes more complex.

244
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,193
There is one more decision.

245
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,543
What happens now?

246
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,186
The majority of the physicians
now choose to let the patient go

247
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,727
for a hip replacement.

248
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,796
I hope this worries you, by the way --

249
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,053
(Laughter)

250
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,796
when you go to see your physician.

251
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:55,164
The thing is that
no physician would ever say,

252
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,981
"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.
Let's go for hip replacement."

253
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:01,796
But the moment you set this
as the default,

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,796
it has a huge power over whatever
people end up doing.

255
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,154
I'll give you a couple of more examples
on irrational decision-making.

256
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,996
Imagine I give you a choice:

257
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,633
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome,
all expenses paid --

258
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:19,219
hotel, transportation, food,
a continental breakfast, everything --

259
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,796
or a weekend in Paris?

260
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,074
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend
in Rome -- these are different things.

261
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:26,876
They have different food,
different culture, different art.

262
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,256
Imagine I added a choice to the set
that nobody wanted.

263
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,032
Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,

264
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,424
a weekend in Paris,

265
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,040
or having your car stolen?"

266
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:38,097
(Laughter)

267
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:41,367
It's a funny idea, because why
would having your car stolen,

268
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,987
in this set, influence anything?

269
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:45,125
(Laughter)

270
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,598
But what if the option to have your car
stolen was not exactly like this?

271
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,154
What if it was a trip to Rome,
all expenses paid,

272
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,456
transportation, breakfast,

273
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,796
but it doesn't include
coffee in the morning?

274
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,193
If you want coffee, you have to pay
for it yourself, it's two euros 50.

275
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,224
(Laughter)

276
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,796
Now in some ways,

277
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,119
given that you can have Rome with coffee,

278
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:07,524
why would you possibly
want Rome without coffee?

279
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:10,492
It's like having your car stolen.
It's an inferior option.

280
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,286
But guess what happened?

281
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,621
The moment you add Rome without coffee,

282
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:18,263
Rome with coffee becomes more popular,
and people choose it.

283
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,796
The fact that you have Rome without coffee

284
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,796
makes Rome with coffee look superior,

285
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,796
and not just to Rome without coffee --
even superior to Paris.

286
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,897
(Laughter)

287
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:32,373
Here are two examples of this principle.

288
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:35,049
This was an ad in The Economist
a few years ago

289
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:37,153
that gave us three choices:

290
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:40,010
an online subscription for 59 dollars,

291
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:43,519
a print subscription for 125 dollars,

292
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:45,796
or you could get both for 125.

293
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,796
(Laughter)

294
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,405
Now I looked at this,
and I called up The Economist,

295
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,992
and I tried to figure out
what they were thinking.

296
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:56,158
And they passed me from one person
to another to another,

297
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:59,905
until eventually I got to the person
who was in charge of the website,

298
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,524
and I called them up, and they went
to check what was going on.

299
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:07,395
The next thing I know,
the ad is gone, no explanation.

300
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,306
So I decided to do the experiment

301
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,972
that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.

302
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:14,395
I took this and I gave it
to 100 MIT students.

303
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,983
I said, "What would you choose?"

304
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,993
These are the market shares --
most people wanted the combo deal.

305
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,225
Thankfully, nobody wanted
the dominant option.

306
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,889
That means our students can read.

307
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,295
(Laughter)

308
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,208
But now, if you have an option
that nobody wants,

309
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:29,931
you can take it off, right?

310
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,796
So I printed another version of this,

311
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,637
where I eliminated the middle option.

312
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:37,144
I gave it to another 100 students.
Here is what happened:

313
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:39,905
Now the most popular option
became the least popular,

314
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,572
and the least popular
became the most popular.

315
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:46,796
What was happening
was the option that was useless,

316
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,671
in the middle, was useless
in the sense that nobody wanted it.

317
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,861
But it wasn't useless in the sense
that it helped people figure out

318
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,036
what they wanted.

319
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,796
In fact, relative
to the option in the middle,

320
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,319
which was get only the print for 125,

321
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:06,096
the print and web for 125
looked like a fantastic deal.

322
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,223
And as a consequence, people chose it.

323
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,874
The general idea here, by the way,

324
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,589
is that we actually don't know
our preferences that well.

325
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:15,083
And because we don't know
our preferences that well,

326
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:18,396
we're susceptible to all of these
influences from the external forces:

327
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,096
the defaults, the particular options
that are presented to us, and so on.

328
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:23,796
One more example of this.

329
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,177
People believe that when we deal
with physical attraction,

330
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,464
we see somebody, and we know immediately
whether we like them or not,

331
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:31,796
if we're attracted or not.

332
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,252
This is why we have
these four-minute dates.

333
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:36,796
So I decided to do
this experiment with people.

334
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,796
I'll show you images here, no real people,
but the experiment was with people.

335
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,796
I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.

336
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,889
and I said, "Who do you want to date?

337
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,388
Tom or Jerry?"

338
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:50,691
But for half the people,
I added an ugly version of Jerry.

339
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:55,796
I took Photoshop and I made
Jerry slightly less attractive.

340
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,233
(Laughter)

341
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:00,796
For the other people, I added
an ugly version of Tom.

342
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,796
And the question was,
will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom

343
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,588
help their respective,
more attractive brothers?

344
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,841
The answer was absolutely yes.

345
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,011
When ugly Jerry was around,
Jerry was popular.

346
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:14,175
When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.

347
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,796
(Laughter)

348
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,332
This of course has two
very clear implications

349
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,665
for life in general.

350
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,796
If you ever go bar-hopping,
who do you want to take with you?

351
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,549
(Laughter)

352
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:34,350
You want a slightly uglier
version of yourself.

353
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:35,796
(Laughter)

354
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,057
Similar, but slightly uglier.

355
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:39,524
(Laughter)

356
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:43,317
The second point, or course, is that
if somebody invites you to bar hop,

357
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,088
you know what they think about you.

358
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,796
(Laughter)

359
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,102
Now you get it.

360
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:51,796
What is the general point?

361
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,078
The general point is that,

362
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,796
when we think about economics, we have
this beautiful view of human nature.

363
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,357
"What a piece of work is a man!
How noble in reason!"

364
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:01,959
We have this view of ourselves, of others.

365
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:07,197
The behavioral economics perspective
is slightly less "generous" to people;

366
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,320
in fact, in medical terms,

367
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,536
that's our view.

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,687
(Laughter)

369
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,796
But there is a silver lining.

370
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,694
The silver lining is, I think,

371
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:23,796
kind of the reason that behavioral
economics is interesting and exciting.

372
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,685
Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?

373
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:30,097
When it comes to building
the physical world,

374
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,153
we kind of understand our limitations.

375
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:33,348
We build steps.

376
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,515
And we build these things
that not everybody can use, obviously.

377
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,435
(Laughter)

378
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,006
We understand our limitations,

379
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,680
and we build around them.

380
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:44,283
But for some reason, when it comes
to the mental world,

381
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,664
when we design things like healthcare
and retirement and stock markets,

382
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,036
we somehow forget the idea
that we are limited.

383
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,967
I think that if we understood
our cognitive limitations

384
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,603
in the same way we understand
our physical limitations,

385
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:58,437
even though they don't stare us
in the face the same way,

386
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:00,941
we could design a better world,
and that, I think,

387
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:02,358
is the hope of this thing.

388
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:03,796
Thank you very much.

389
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,462
(Applause)
