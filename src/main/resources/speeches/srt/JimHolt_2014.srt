1
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:14,821
Why does the universe exist?

2
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,816
Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter)

3
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:21,658
This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.

4
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:25,234
Why is there a world, why are we in it,

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,113
and why is there something rather than nothing at all?

6
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:31,759
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,994
So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,

8
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:35,550
the puzzle of existence,

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,464
where we are now in addressing it,

10
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,714
and why you should care,

11
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,630
and I hope you do care.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,456
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that

13
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:49,236
those who don't wonder about
the contingency of their existence,

14
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:52,093
of the contingency of the world's existence,

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,756
are mentally deficient.

16
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:57,703
That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)

17
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,380
So this has been called the most sublime

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,674
and awesome mystery,

19
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:04,343
the deepest and most far-reaching question

20
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,403
man can pose.

21
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:07,117
It's obsessed great thinkers.

22
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,721
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest

23
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,051
philosopher of the 20th century,

24
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,534
was astonished that there should be a world at all.

25
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:17,538
He wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,

26
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:20,228
"It is not how things are in the world

27
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,580
that is the mystical,

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,915
it's that the world exists."

29
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:26,133
And if you don't like taking your epigrams

30
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,044
from a philosopher, try a scientist.

31
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:31,645
John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists

32
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:32,871
of the 20th century,

33
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,796
the teacher of Richard Feynman,

34
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:37,456
the coiner of the term "black hole,"

35
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,879
he said, "I want to know

36
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,612
how come the quantum,

37
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:44,756
how come the universe, how come existence?"

38
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,755
And my friend Martin Amis —

39
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,432
sorry that I'll be doing a lot of
name-dropping in this talk,

40
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,807
so get used to it —

41
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:55,783
my dear friend Martin Amis once said

42
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,003
that we're about five Einsteins away from answering

43
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,039
the mystery of where the universe came from.

44
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,020
And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,207
in the audience tonight.

46
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,710
Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?

47
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,872
No Einsteins? Okay.

48
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:12,094
So this question, why is there
something rather than nothing,

49
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:14,062
this sublime question, was posed rather late

50
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,372
in intellectual history.

51
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,851
It was towards the end of the 17th century,

52
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,813
the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,

53
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,556
a very smart guy, Leibniz,

54
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,706
who invented the calculus

55
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:28,560
independently of Isaac Newton,
at about the same time,

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,162
but for Leibniz, who asked why is
there something rather than nothing,

57
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,355
this was not a great mystery.

58
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,751
He either was or pretended to be

59
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,507
an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,

60
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,522
and he said it's obvious why the world exists:

61
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:43,984
because God created it.

62
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:47,269
And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.

63
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,780
That's how powerful God is.

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,422
He doesn't need any preexisting
materials to fashion a world out of.

65
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,582
He can make it out of sheer nothingness,

66
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,056
creation ex nihilo.

67
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:57,001
And by the way, this is what

68
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,840
most Americans today believe.

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,554
There is no mystery of existence for them.

70
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,122
God made it.

71
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,708
So let's put this in an equation.

72
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,335
I don't have any slides so
I'm going to mime my visuals,

73
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,770
so use your imaginations.

74
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,624
So it's God + nothing = the world.

75
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:18,938
Okay? Now that's the equation.

76
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,671
And so maybe you don't believe in God.

77
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:22,501
Maybe you're a scientific atheist

78
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:25,835
or an unscientific atheist,
and you don't believe in God,

79
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,253
and you're not happy with it.

80
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:29,957
By the way, even if we have this equation,

81
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:31,859
God + nothing = the world,

82
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,545
there's already a problem:

83
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,579
Why does God exist?

84
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,782
God doesn't exist by logic alone

85
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,595
unless you believe the ontological argument,

86
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,922
and I hope you don't, because
it's not a good argument.

87
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,083
So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,

88
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,233
he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,

89
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,663
but where did I come from?

90
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,833
(Laughter)

91
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,252
Whence then am I?

92
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,460
God speaks in a more formal English.

93
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,449
(Laughter)

94
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,497
And so one theory is that God was so bored with

95
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,286
pondering the puzzle of His own existence

96
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,208
that He created the world just to distract himself.

97
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,320
But anyway, let's forget about God.

98
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,677
Take God out of the equation: We have

99
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:14,800
________ + nothing = the world.

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,581
Now, if you're a Buddhist,

101
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,325
you might want to stop right there,

102
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,294
because essentially what you've got is

103
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,870
nothing = the world,

104
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,383
and by symmetry of identity, that means

105
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:25,738
the world = nothing. Okay?

106
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,157
And to a Buddhist, the world
is just a whole lot of nothing.

107
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:31,263
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.

108
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:33,815
And we think there's a lot of something out there

109
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,380
but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.

110
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,091
If we let our desires melt away,

111
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:41,971
we'll see the world for what it truly is,

112
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,951
a vacuity, nothingness,

113
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,133
and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana

114
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,956
which has been defined as having

115
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:51,274
just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)

116
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,153
So that's the Buddhist thinking.

117
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:56,652
But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned

118
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:58,635
with the puzzle of existence, so I've got

119
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,243
________ + —

120
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,401
this is going to get serious in a minute, so —

121
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,427
________ + nothing = the world.

122
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:06,650
What are we going to put in that blank?

123
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,498
Well, how about science?

124
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:12,049
Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,

125
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:15,064
and the most fundamental science is physics.

126
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,034
That tells us what naked reality really is,

127
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,660
that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,

128
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,650
the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.

129
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,302
So maybe physics can fill this blank,

130
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:31,364
and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,

131
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,027
physicists have purported to give

132
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:38,147
a purely scientific explanation of how

133
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:41,142
a universe like ours could have popped into existence

134
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,021
out of sheer nothingness,

135
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:46,101
a quantum fluctuation out of the void.

136
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:48,159
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,

137
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,465
more recently Alex Vilenkin,

138
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:52,198
and the whole thing has been popularized

139
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,391
by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,

140
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,923
Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called

141
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,049
"A Universe from Nothing,"

142
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,265
and Lawrence thinks that he's given —

143
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,346
he's a militant atheist, by the way,

144
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,970
so he's gotten God out of the picture.

145
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,351
The laws of quantum field theory,

146
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,252
the state-of-the-art physics, can show how

147
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:10,570
out of sheer nothingness,

148
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,795
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,

149
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:16,240
a little nugget of false vacuum

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,213
can fluctuate into existence,

151
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:20,195
and then, by the miracle of inflation,

152
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,280
blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,035
we see around us.

154
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,589
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.

155
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,357
It's very speculative. It's fascinating.

156
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,685
But I've got a big problem with it,

157
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,570
and the problem is this:

158
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,041
It's a pseudo-religious point of view.

159
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,037
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,

160
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,785
but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.

161
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:46,554
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.

162
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:48,604
The laws of quantum field theory for him

163
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,215
are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."

164
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:55,654
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout

165
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:57,761
that they can form the abyss,

166
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,601
that it's pregnant with being.

167
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:02,508
They can call a world into existence out of nothing.

168
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,455
But that's a very primitive view of what

169
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:05,928
a physical law is, right?

170
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:09,183
We know that physical laws are actually

171
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:12,227
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities

172
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:13,432
in the world.

173
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,805
They don't exist outside the world.

174
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:17,785
They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.

175
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,780
They can't call a world into existence

176
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,098
out of nothingness.

177
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,629
That's a very primitive view

178
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,813
of what a scientific law is.

179
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,808
And if you don't believe me on this,

180
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:28,610
listen to Stephen Hawking,

181
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,645
who himself put forward a model of the cosmos

182
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:33,721
that was self-contained,

183
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,359
didn't require any outside cause, any creator,

184
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,087
and after proposing this,

185
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,501
Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.

186
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:44,813
He said, this model is just equations.

187
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,672
What breathes fire into the equations

188
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,594
and creates a world for them to describe?

189
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:51,727
He was puzzled by this,

190
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:55,532
so equations themselves can't do the magic,

191
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:57,670
can't resolve the puzzle of existence.

192
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,583
And besides, even if the laws could do that,

193
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,406
why this set of laws?

194
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:04,970
Why quantum field theory that describes

195
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,670
a universe with a certain number of forces

196
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,719
and particles and so forth?

197
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,010
Why not a completely different set of laws?

198
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,298
There are many, many mathematically
consistent sets of laws.

199
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:16,737
Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?

200
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,469
So this is a problem, believe it or not,

201
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:21,467
that reflective physicists really think a lot about,

202
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,575
and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,

203
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,790
say, well, maybe the set of laws

204
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,037
that describes our universe,

205
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,772
it's just one set of laws

206
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:31,808
and it describes one part of reality,

207
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:34,604
but maybe every consistent set of laws

208
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,390
describes another part of reality,

209
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,323
and in fact all possible physical worlds

210
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,774
really exist, they're all out there.

211
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,057
We just see a little tiny part of reality

212
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,600
that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,332
but there are many, many other worlds,

214
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:51,098
parts of reality that are described

215
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,055
by vastly different theories

216
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:56,071
that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,

217
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:59,816
that are inconceivably exotic.

218
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,553
Steven Weinberg, the father

219
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,994
of the standard model of particle physics,

220
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,820
has actually flirted with this idea himself,

221
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,063
that all possible realities actually exist.

222
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:14,152
Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,

223
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:18,528
who believes that all mathematical structures exist,

224
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,665
and mathematical existence is the same thing

225
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,432
as physical existence,

226
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,750
so we have this vastly rich multiverse

227
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,191
that encompasses every logical possibility.

228
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:31,701
Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,

229
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,973
these physicists and also philosophers are actually

230
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,495
reaching back to a very old idea

231
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,952
that goes back to Plato.

232
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,150
It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,

233
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,063
or the great chain of being,

234
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:46,930
that reality is actually as full as possible.

235
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,631
It's as far removed from nothingness

236
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,526
as it could possibly be.

237
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,020
So we have these two extremes now.

238
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,319
We have sheer nothingness on one side,

239
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,817
and we have this vision of a reality

240
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:03,000
that encompasses every conceivable world

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,729
at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,

242
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,622
nothingness, the simplest possible reality.

243
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:11,501
Now what's in between these two extremes?

244
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,528
There are all kinds of intermediate realities

245
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:16,475
that include some things and leave out others.

246
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,071
So one of these intermediate realities

247
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:23,766
is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,

248
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,441
that leaves out the inelegant bits,

249
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:28,087
the ugly asymmetries and so forth.

250
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,413
Now, there are some physicists who will tell you

251
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:34,047
that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.

252
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,994
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,

253
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:40,607
and he has written a book
called "The Elegant Universe."

254
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,878
He claims that the universe we live in mathematically

255
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,587
is very elegant.

256
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:46,270
Don't believe him. (Laughter)

257
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,357
It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,

258
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,270
but I think the other day he admitted to me

259
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,334
it's really an ugly universe.

260
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,710
It's stupidly constructed,

261
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,964
it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants

262
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,630
and mass ratios

263
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,408
and superfluous families of elementary particles,

264
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,556
and what the hell is dark energy?

265
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:08,955
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.

266
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:12,958
It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)

267
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,701
And then there's the best of all possible worlds

268
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,291
in an ethical sense.

269
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,470
You should get solemn now,

270
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,665
because a world in which sentient beings

271
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:23,285
don't suffer needlessly,

272
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,154
in which there aren't things like

273
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,369
childhood cancer or the Holocaust.

274
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,620
This is an ethical conception.

275
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,685
Anyway, so between nothingness

276
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,318
and the fullest possible reality,

277
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,863
various special realities.

278
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,143
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.

279
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:39,653
Then there's the most elegant possible reality.

280
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,017
That's special.

281
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,669
The fullest possible reality, that's special.

282
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,185
But what are we leaving out here?

283
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,921
There's also just the crummy,

284
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,676
generic realities

285
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,297
that aren't special in any way,

286
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,849
that are sort of random.

287
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,576
They're infinitely removed from nothingness,

288
00:11:56,576 --> 00:12:00,502
but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.

289
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,022
They're a mixture of chaos and order,

290
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,220
of mathematical elegance and ugliness.

291
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,005
So I would describe these realities

292
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:13,132
as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,

293
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,512
a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.

294
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:18,696
And these realities,

295
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,962
is there a deity in any of these realities?

296
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,373
Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect

297
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,709
like the Judeo-Christian deity.

298
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,016
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.

299
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:32,347
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent

300
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,450
but only 80 percent effective,

301
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,587
which pretty much describes the world
we see around us, I think. (Laughter)

302
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,319
So I would like to propose that the resolution

303
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,155
to the mystery of existence

304
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:49,245
is that the reality we exist in

305
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,301
is one of these generic realities.

306
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,956
Reality has to turn out some way.

307
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,026
It can either turn out to be nothing

308
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,707
or everything or something in between.

309
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:03,398
So if it has some special feature,

310
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,588
like being really elegant or really full

311
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,196
or really simple, like nothingness,

312
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,997
that would require an explanation.

313
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,156
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,

314
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:14,306
there's no further explanation for it.

315
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,690
And indeed, I would say

316
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,670
that's the reality we live in.

317
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,927
That's what science is telling us.

318
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,258
At the beginning of the week,

319
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,374
we got the exciting information that

320
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,513
the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,

321
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:31,483
infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,

322
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:35,308
it's like a big frothing champagne

323
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,992
coming out of a bottle endlessly,

324
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,084
a vast universe, mostly a wasteland

325
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:44,350
with little pockets of charm and order and peace,

326
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,715
this has been confirmed,

327
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:49,617
this inflationary scenario, by the observations

328
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,710
made by radio telescopes in Antarctica

329
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,533
that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves

330
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,457
from just before the Big Bang.

331
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,302
I'm sure you all know about this.

332
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,126
So anyway, I think there's some evidence

333
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:04,613
that this really is the reality that we're stuck with.

334
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,720
Now, why should you care?

335
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,956
Well — (Laughter) —

336
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:12,380
the question, "Why does the world exist?"

337
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,059
that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes

338
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,513
with a more intimate question:

339
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:18,596
Why do I exist? Why do you exist?

340
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,196
you know, our existence would
seem to be amazingly improbable,

341
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,515
because there's an enormous number
of genetically possible humans,

342
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:27,919
if you can compute it by looking at

343
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,261
the number of the genes and the
number of alleles and so forth,

344
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,557
and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you

345
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,712
there are about 10 to the 10,000th

346
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,372
possible humans, genetically.

347
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:39,840
That's between a googol and a googolplex.

348
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,456
And the number of the actual
humans that have existed

349
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,950
is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,

350
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,015
an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,

351
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,945
we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.

352
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,064
We're here. Okay.

353
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,985
So what kind of reality do we want to live in?

354
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,235
Do we want to live in a special reality?

355
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:59,464
What if we were living in the
most elegant possible reality?

356
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,973
Imagine the existential pressure on us

357
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:03,812
to live up to that, to be elegant,

358
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,678
not to pull down the tone of it.

359
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:08,759
Or, what if we were living
in the fullest possible reality?

360
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,770
Well then our existence would be guaranteed,

361
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,548
because every possible thing

362
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:13,914
exists in that reality,

363
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,075
but our choices would be meaningless.

364
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:19,070
If I really struggle morally and agonize

365
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,150
and I decide to do the right thing,

366
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,345
what difference does it make,

367
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:24,370
because there are an infinite number

368
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,384
of versions of me

369
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,781
also doing the right thing

370
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,436
and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.

371
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,276
So my choices are meaningless.

372
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,560
So we don't want to live in that special reality.

373
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,147
And as for the special reality of nothingness,

374
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,374
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

375
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:44,309
So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,

376
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,205
there are nasty bits and nice bits

377
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,747
and we could make the nice bits bigger

378
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,086
and the nasty bits smaller

379
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,977
and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.

380
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:54,383
The universe is absurd,

381
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,110
but we can still construct a purpose,

382
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,050
and that's a pretty good one,

383
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,715
and the overall mediocrity of reality

384
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,320
kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity

385
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,632
we all feel in the core of our being.

386
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,266
And I know you feel it.

387
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,370
I know you're all special,

388
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,692
but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,

389
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,081
don't you think?

390
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,018
(Laughter) (Applause)

391
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:17,070
So anyway, you may say, this 
puzzle, the mystery of existence,

392
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,488
it's just silly mystery-mongering.

393
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:22,355
You're not astonished at the existence of the universe

394
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,990
and you're in good company.

395
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,206
Bertrand Russell said,

396
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:29,861
"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."

397
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,262
Just a brute fact.

398
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:34,096
And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,

399
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,805
a great philosophical wag,

400
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,422
when I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,

401
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:39,918
why is there something rather than nothing?"

402
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:42,068
And he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,

403
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,064
you still wouldn't be satisfied."

404
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:47,813
So — (Laughter) — okay.

405
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:50,175
So you're not astonished. I don't care.

406
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,148
But I will tell you something to conclude

407
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:55,426
that I guarantee you will astonish you,

408
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,093
because it's astonished all of the brilliant,

409
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,406
wonderful people I've met at this TED conference,

410
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,620
when I've told them, and it's this:

411
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,122
Never in my life have I had a cell phone.

412
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:08,999
Thank you.

413
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:12,999
(Laughter) (Applause)
