1
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:17,319
I'd like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends

2
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,796
in the coming century,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,320
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.

4
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:25,796
But I want to start
with my work on romantic love,

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,685
because that's my most recent work.

6
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:32,796
What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love,

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,796
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

8
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:38,037
17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted;

9
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:41,011
and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped.

10
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:44,170
And so I want to tell you
about that first,

11
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:47,059
and then go on into where
I think love is going.

12
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,509
(Laughter)

13
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,279
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.

14
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,276
I think our ancestors --

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,198
I think human beings have been
wondering about this question

16
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,998
since they sat around their campfires

17
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:04,713
or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago.

18
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:09,979
I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was

19
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:15,486
by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,817
and as it turns out,

21
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:20,795
there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love.

22
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,796
The first thing that happens is,

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,796
a person begins to take on
what I call, "special meaning."

24
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,015
As a truck driver once said to me,

25
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,820
"The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."

26
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,581
George Bernard Shaw said it differently.

27
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,073
"Love consists of overestimating
the differences

28
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,105
between one woman and another."

29
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,391
And indeed, that's what we do.

30
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:45,669
(Laughter)

31
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:48,289
And then you just focus on this person.

32
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:51,130
You can list what you
don't like about them,

33
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:54,718
but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do.

34
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:56,741
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,511
In trying to understand romantic love,

36
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:03,512
I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world,

37
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:06,188
and I just want to give
you one very short poem

38
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,459
from eighth-century China,

39
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,692
because it's an almost perfect example

40
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:13,080
of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman.

41
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:16,684
It's a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody

42
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,346
and you walk into a parking lot --

43
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,750
their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot.

44
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,280
Their wine glass at dinner

45
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:26,796
is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party.

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,584
And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat.

47
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:32,331
And it goes like this.

48
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,846
It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.

49
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:37,796
"I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat.

50
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,462
The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."

51
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,645
He became hooked on a sleeping mat,

52
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,645
probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain,

53
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,090
just like with you and me.

54
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:52,279
But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning,

55
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,749
you focus your attention on them.

56
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,374
You aggrandize them.

57
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:58,159
But you have intense energy.

58
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:01,678
As one Polynesian said,
"I felt like jumping in the sky."

59
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,423
You're up all night.
You're walking till dawn.

60
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:08,406
You feel intense elation
when things are going well;

61
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,979
mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly.

62
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:14,457
Real dependence on this person.

63
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,880
As one businessman in New York said to me,

64
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,765
"Anything she liked, I liked."

65
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,305
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.

66
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:24,796
You become extremely sexually possessive.

67
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,551
You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually,

68
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,445
you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else.

69
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,023
But the moment you fall in love,

70
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,343
you become extremely
sexually possessive of them.

71
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,796
I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this.

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,453
The whole point of this
is to pull two people together

73
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:43,783
strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team.

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,796
But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving:

75
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,242
an intense craving
to be with a particular person,

76
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,489
not just sexually, but emotionally.

77
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:57,241
It would be nice to go to bed with them,

78
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:01,497
but you want them to call you
on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,

79
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,377
to tell you that they love you.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,002
The other main characteristic
is motivation.

81
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:12,391
The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person.

82
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,684
And last but not least,
it is an obsession.

83
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:19,796
Before I put these people
in the MRI machine,

84
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,796
I would ask them all kinds of questions.

85
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,985
But my most important question
was always the same.

86
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,796
It was: "What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"

87
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,710
And indeed, they would say,

88
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,891
"All day. All night.

89
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,256
I can never stop thinking
about him or her."

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,630
And then, the very last question --

91
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,253
I would always have to work
myself up to this question,

92
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,844
because I'm not a psychologist.

93
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:45,844
I don't work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation.

94
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:48,119
My final question was always the same.

95
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,796
I would say,
"Would you die for him or her?"

96
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,356
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"

97
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,491
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.

98
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,209
I was just staggered by it.

99
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:02,040
So we scanned their brains,

100
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,174
looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart

101
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:05,966
and looking at a neutral photograph,

102
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,824
with a distraction task in between.

103
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:12,796
So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,117
and when it was in a resting state.

105
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,960
And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions.

106
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,642
In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region

107
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,874
that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

108
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,820
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.

109
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,089
I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion.

110
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,969
In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions,

111
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,699
from very high to very low.

112
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,429
But actually, it's a drive.

113
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,588
It comes from the motor of the mind,

114
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:44,277
the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind.

115
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,796
The kind of part of the mind

116
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,460
when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate,

117
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:52,322
when you want to win
that promotion at work.

118
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,265
The motor of the brain.

119
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,493
It's a drive.

120
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:58,620
And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive.

121
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,469
You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you,

122
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,930
and they say, "No, thank you,"

123
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,471
you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression.

124
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,688
But certainly, around the world,

125
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:13,669
people who are rejected
in love will kill for it.

126
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,304
People live for love.

127
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,588
They kill for love.

128
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:17,643
They die for love.

129
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:21,675
They have songs, poems, novels,

130
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,643
sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.

131
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,816
In over 175 societies,

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,624
people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system.

133
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:33,671
I have come to think

134
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,283
it's one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth

135
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:38,884
for both great joy and great sorrow.

136
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,916
And I've also come to think

137
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,423
that it's one of three
basically different brain systems

138
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,495
that evolved from mating and reproduction.

139
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:49,947
One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification.

140
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,796
W.H. Auden called it
an "intolerable neural itch,"

141
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,795
and indeed, that's what it is.

142
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:59,542
It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry.

143
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:03,670
The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love:

144
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,796
that elation, obsession of early love.

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,176
And the third brain system is attachment:

146
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,153
that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner.

147
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:15,330
And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there,

148
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,909
looking for a whole range of partners.

149
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,718
You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car.

150
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:22,114
It can be focused on nobody.

151
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:25,796
I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy

152
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,796
on just one individual at a time,

153
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,652
thereby conserving mating time and energy.

154
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:33,406
And I think that attachment,
the third brain system,

155
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,972
evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being

156
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:41,049
at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team.

157
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,318
So with that preamble,

158
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:50,373
I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends.

159
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,103
One of the last 10,000 years

160
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:57,824
and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years,

161
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:02,100
that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems:

162
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:05,677
lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner.

163
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:10,543
The first is women working,
moving into the workforce.

164
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:16,044
I've looked at 130 societies

165
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,709
through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations.

166
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:23,465
Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them,

167
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,796
women are not only moving
into the job market --

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,796
sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market --

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,674
and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women

170
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:37,495
in terms of economic power,
health and education.

171
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,655
It's very slow.

172
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,796
For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend.

173
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,133
We all know of them, but nevertheless --

174
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:50,553
the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark,
but the caravan moves on."

175
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,904
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.

176
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,615
Women are moving back into the job market.

177
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,796
And I say back into the job market,
because this is not new.

178
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:02,809
For millions of years,
on the grasslands of Africa,

179
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,983
women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables.

180
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:09,667
They came home with 60 to 80 percent
of the evening meal.

181
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,579
The double income family was the standard.

182
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,033
And women were regarded
as just as economically,

183
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:19,796
socially and sexually powerful as men.

184
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,623
In short, we're really
moving forward to the past.

185
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:29,336
Then, women's worst
invention was the plow.

186
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,034
With the beginning of plow agriculture,
men's roles became extremely powerful.

187
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:37,494
Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors,

188
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:41,197
but then with the industrial revolution
and the post-industrial revolution

189
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,164
they're moving back into the job market.

190
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:48,315
In short, they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago,

191
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,563
10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.

192
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:56,158
We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions

193
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,515
in the history of the human animal.

194
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:02,082
And it's going to have an impact.

195
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:03,639
I generally give a whole lecture

196
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:05,967
on the impact of women
on the business community.

197
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,048
I'll say just a couple of things,
and then go on to sex and love.

198
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,929
There's a lot of gender differences;

199
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,129
anybody who thinks men and women are alike

200
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,095
simply never had a boy and a girl child.

201
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:18,312
I don't know why they want to think
that men and women are alike.

202
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,859
There's much we have in common,

203
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:22,796
but there's a whole lot
that we do not have in common.

204
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,796
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,

205
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,924
"I think that we are like two feet.
We need each other to get ahead."

206
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,796
But we did not evolve
to have the same brain.

207
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,269
And we're finding more and more
gender differences in the brain.

208
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:39,420
I'll only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love.

209
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,551
One of them is women's verbal ability.

210
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,796
Women can talk.

211
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,796
Women's ability to find the right word
rapidly, basic articulation

212
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,198
goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle,

213
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:50,793
when estrogen levels peak.

214
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,435
But even at menstruation,
they're better than the average man.

215
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,967
Women can talk.

216
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:59,796
They've been doing it for a million years;
words were women's tools.

217
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,907
They held that baby
in front of their face,

218
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:05,740
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

219
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:08,796
And, indeed, they're becoming
a very powerful force.

220
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,057
Even in places like India and Japan,

221
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:17,478
where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market,

222
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,335
they're moving into journalism.

223
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:23,796
And I think that the television
is like the global campfire.

224
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,796
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.

225
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,904
Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me,

226
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,071
who negotiates what we're going to say,

227
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:35,150
is a woman.

228
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,832
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,

229
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:41,010
"To have a great writer
is to have another government."

230
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:46,089
Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women.

231
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:49,651
It's one of many,
many characteristics that women have

232
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,955
that they will bring into the job market.

233
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,106
They've got incredible people skills,
negotiating skills.

234
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,796
They're highly imaginative.

235
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,399
We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination, of long-term planning.

236
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,543
They tend to be web thinkers.

237
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,352
Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected,

238
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,550
they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think,

239
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:15,277
put them into more complex patterns,
see more options and outcomes.

240
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,007
They tend to be contextual,
holistic thinkers,

241
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,571
what I call web thinkers.

242
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,600
Men tend to -- and these are averages --

243
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:25,283
tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous,

244
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:26,692
focus on what they do,

245
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:32,642
and move in a more
step-by-step thinking pattern.

246
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:35,093
They're both perfectly good
ways of thinking.

247
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,349
We need both of them to get ahead.

248
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,796
In fact, there's many more
male geniuses in the world.

249
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,541
And there's also many more
male idiots in the world.

250
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,291
(Laughter)

251
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:48,497
When the male brain works well,
it works extremely well.

252
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:51,855
And what I really think
that we're doing is,

253
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,165
we're moving towards
a collaborative society,

254
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,991
a society in which the talents
of both men and women

255
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:00,796
are becoming understood
and valued and employed.

256
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,583
But in fact, women moving
into the job market

257
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:08,717
is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life.

258
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:14,512
Foremost, women are starting
to express their sexuality.

259
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:17,162
I'm always astonished
when people come to me and say,

260
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:19,504
"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"

261
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:22,241
"Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women?"

262
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:23,836
"Well, men are more adulterous!"

263
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,798
And I say, "Who do you think
these men are sleeping with?"

264
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,226
(Laughter)

265
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,978
And -- basic math!

266
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,176
Anyway.

267
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,796
In the Western world,

268
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,796
women start sooner at sex,
have more partners,

269
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,705
express less remorse
for the partners that they do,

270
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,411
marry later, have fewer children,

271
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,340
leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones.

272
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:50,343
We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression.

273
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:55,088
And, indeed, once again we're moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression

274
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:58,796
that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago,

275
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,796
because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see

276
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,078
in hunting and gathering societies today.

277
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,661
We're also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality.

278
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,796
They're now saying that the 21st century

279
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,796
is going to be the century of what
they call the "symmetrical marriage,"

280
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,204
or the "pure marriage,"
or the "companionate marriage."

281
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:26,796
This is a marriage between equals,

282
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,263
moving forward to a pattern

283
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:32,421
that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit.

284
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:36,134
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.

285
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:40,832
91 percent of American women
and 86 percent of American men

286
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:45,459
would not marry somebody
who had every single quality

287
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,299
they were looking for in a partner,

288
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,086
if they were not in love with that person.

289
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,629
People around the world,
in a study of 37 societies,

290
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:57,290
want to be in love
with the person that they marry.

291
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:03,820
Indeed, arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life.

292
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,232
I even think that marriages
might even become more stable

293
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:14,010
because of the second great world trend.

294
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:16,796
The first one being women
moving into the job market,

295
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,670
the second one being
the aging world population.

296
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:22,121
They're now saying that in America,

297
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:25,796
that middle age should be regarded
as up to age 85.

298
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:31,341
Because in that highest
age category of 76 to 85,

299
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,796
as much as 40 percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them.

300
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,202
So we're seeing there's a real
extension of middle age.

301
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:43,796
For one of my books,
I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.

302
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,051
And as it turns out, the older you get,
the less likely you are to divorce.

303
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:52,017
So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America,

304
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,375
and it's actually beginning to decline.

305
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,001
It may decline some more.

306
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:02,952
I would even say that with Viagra,

307
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:06,791
estrogen replacement, hip replacements

308
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,796
and the incredibly interesting women

309
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,925
-- women have never been
as interesting as they are now.

310
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:15,407
Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated,

311
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,378
so interesting, so capable.

312
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:23,161
And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution

313
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:27,050
when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages, that time is now.

314
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:31,537
However, there's always kinds
of complications in this.

315
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:36,278
These three brain systems
-- lust, romantic love and attachment --

316
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:37,656
don't always go together.

317
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,379
They can go together, by the way.

318
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,355
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.

319
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,648
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.

320
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,768
Dopamine's associated with romantic love,

321
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,815
and you can just
fall in love with somebody

322
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,702
who you're just having casual sex with.

323
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:53,162
With orgasm, then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin --

324
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,217
those are associated with attachment.

325
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:59,200
This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody

326
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:01,073
after you've made love to them.

327
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:05,796
But these three brain systems:
lust, romantic love and attachment,

328
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,301
aren't always connected to each other.

329
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,071
You can feel deep attachment
to a long-term partner

330
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:16,187
while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else,

331
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:21,664
while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners.

332
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:27,161
In short, we're capable of loving
more than one person at a time.

333
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,526
In fact, you can lie in bed at night

334
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,796
and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person

335
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,252
to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else.

336
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:39,157
It's as if there's a committee meeting
going on in your head

337
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,308
as you are trying to decide what to do.

338
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:43,967
So I don't think, honestly,

339
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:46,006
we're an animal
that was built to be happy;

340
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,298
we are an animal
that was built to reproduce.

341
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:51,257
I think the happiness we find, we make.

342
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,763
And I think, however,

343
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,454
we can make good relationships
with each other.

344
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,925
So I want to conclude with two things.

345
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,996
I want to conclude with a worry,

346
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,949
and with a wonderful story.

347
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,796
The worry is about antidepressants.

348
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:15,583
Over 100 million prescriptions
of antidepressants

349
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,428
are written every year
in the United States.

350
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,485
And these drugs are going generic.

351
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,992
They are seeping around the world.

352
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:29,796
I know one girl who's been
on these antidepressants,

353
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,796
SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
antidepressants -- since she was 13.

354
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,796
She's 23. She's been on them
ever since she was 13.

355
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,336
I've got nothing against people
who take them short term,

356
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,583
when they're going
through something horrible.

357
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,962
They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else.

358
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,054
I would recommend it.

359
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,537
But more and more people
in the United States

360
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,945
are taking them long term.

361
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:56,334
And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin.

362
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:01,615
And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit.

363
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,201
Everybody knows that.

364
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,659
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.

365
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,597
Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit,

366
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,488
but they kill the sex drive.

367
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,960
And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm.

368
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:19,175
And when you kill orgasm,

369
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,066
you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment.

370
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,796
The things are connected in the brain.

371
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,476
And when you tamper with one brain system,

372
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,445
you're going to tamper with another.

373
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,574
I'm just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place.

374
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,560
So now --

375
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:41,796
(Applause)

376
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,523
Thank you.

377
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,032
I want to end with a story.

378
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:46,959
And then, just a comment.

379
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:53,340
I've been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years.

380
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,110
I'm an identical twin;
I am interested in why we're all alike.

381
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,796
Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese

382
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,820
and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River

383
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:06,844
are all alike.

384
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,906
And about a year ago,

385
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,915
an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me

386
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:16,591
and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them.

387
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,417
I said, "I don't know anything
about personality. You know?

388
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,161
I don't know. Do you think
you've got the right person?"

389
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,225
They said, "Yes."

390
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,272
It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love

391
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,028
with one person rather than another.

392
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,495
That's my current project;
it will be my next book.

393
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,621
There's all kinds of reasons

394
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:36,398
that you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

395
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:39,708
Timing is important.
Proximity is important.

396
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:41,112
Mystery is important.

397
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:43,865
You fall in love with somebody
who's somewhat mysterious,

398
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,567
in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain,

399
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:49,357
probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love.

400
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,810
You fall in love with somebody

401
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,929
who fits within
what I call your "love map,"

402
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,100
an unconscious list of traits

403
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:57,438
that you build in childhood
as you grow up.

404
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:00,504
And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people,

405
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,796
actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems.

406
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,107
And that's what I'm now
contributing to this.

407
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,796
But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate.

408
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,796
I've been carrying on here
about the biology of love.

409
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,216
I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too,

410
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,407
the magic of it.

411
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,169
It's a story that was told to me

412
00:21:23,193 --> 00:21:25,654
by somebody who had
heard it just from one --

413
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:26,796
probably a true story.

414
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,796
It was a graduate student --
I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --

415
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,796
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.

416
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,191
That's where we put our people
in the MRI machine.

417
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,383
And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student,

418
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,780
and she was not in love with him.

419
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:47,281
And they were
all at a conference in Beijing.

420
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,339
And he knew from our work

421
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:55,771
that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody,

422
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:57,796
you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain,

423
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,513
and perhaps trigger this brain
system for romantic love.

424
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,694
(Laughter)

425
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:07,604
So he decided he'd put science to work.

426
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:11,778
And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him.

427
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,698
And sure enough -- I've never been in one,

428
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,460
but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks

429
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:20,302
and it's crazy and it's noisy
and it's exciting.

430
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:22,612
He figured that this would drive up
the dopamine,

431
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:24,168
and she'd fall in love with him.

432
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:29,166
So off they go and she's squealing
and squeezing him

433
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,707
and laughing and having a wonderful time.

434
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:35,270
An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw,

435
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:38,874
and she throws her hands up and she says,

436
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,210
"Wasn't that wonderful?"

437
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,648
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw
driver handsome!"

438
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:47,741
(Laughter)

439
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:53,796
(Applause)

440
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,982
There's magic to love!

441
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,617
(Applause)

442
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,261
But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago,

443
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:02,617
we evolved three basic drives:

444
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,160
the sex drive, romantic love

445
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,524
and attachment to a long-term partner.

446
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,627
These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain.

447
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:15,426
They're going to survive
as long as our species survives

448
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,158
on what Shakespeare called
"this mortal coil."

449
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:19,188
Thank you.

450
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:20,637
Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!

451
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,724
(Applause)
