1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,820
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,820
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,820
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,820
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,

7
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
the body formerly known as a planet.

9
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,820
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,820
a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,

11
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,820
to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and we, living on it, came to be.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to

14
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,820
and search for answers to questions like this,

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,820
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,820
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,820
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,

20
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost

21
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
that humanity had ever established around the Sun.

22
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,820
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,820
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,820
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,820
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.

27
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,

28
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,820
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,

30
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,820
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
for a much larger human voyage

33
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
and also how humans fit into that picture.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,820
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.

38
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories

39
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
that we are conducting around Saturn,

41
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
and have been for the past two and a half years.

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,820
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,820
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,

46
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,820
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.

48
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.

49
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,820
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,

50
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
and, until Cassini had arrived there,

51
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,820
was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,820
that we had remaining in our solar system.

53
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.

54
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
It has a very large, thick atmosphere,

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,

57
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.

58
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,

59
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
except that its atmosphere is suffused with

60
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.

61
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan

62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,820
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,820
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface

65
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.

66
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
But these haze particles, it was surmised,

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,820
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface

69
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
in a thick organic sludge.

70
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,820
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.

71
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,

72
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:05,820
especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.

73
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,820
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.

74
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
It's a condensable in the atmosphere,

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,820
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore

76
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,820
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,

77
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,

78
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.

79
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,820
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

80
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,820
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.

81
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers

82
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,820
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.

83
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,

84
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.

85
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.

86
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,820
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.

87
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,

88
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
it might be raining, and you might be standing

89
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,820
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)

90
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,820
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,

91
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,820
and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,

92
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.

93
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --

94
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,820
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.

96
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,820
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.

97
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
And yet another moon there --

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface

100
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,820
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.

101
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
And we have taken pictures like this.

102
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,820
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.

103
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,820
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.

104
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,820
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things

105
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,820
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.

106
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,

108
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
meaning it's a very young surface.

109
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
And there are features that look tectonic.

110
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
They look like they've been pulled apart.

111
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,

112
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,820
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.

113
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
And so it's been tectonically altered.

114
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
But we couldn't make sense of our images,

115
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,820
until, six months after we got into orbit,

116
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
an event occurred that many have regarded

117
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.

118
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,

119
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried

120
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,820
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,

121
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,820
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.

122
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,820
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.

123
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
This is a device of human making,

124
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.

125
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,820
It is so significant that, in my mind,

126
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
this was an event that should have been celebrated

127
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,820
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,

128
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
and sadly, that wasn't the case.

129
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
(Laughter).

130
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,

132
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,

133
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,820
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.

134
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,820
It was a moving demonstration of what the words

135
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
"united nations" are supposed to mean:

136
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,820
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,

138
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
and to come to understand a planetary system

139
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,820
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,

140
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
and now humans had actually touched it.

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.

142
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
It was a tremendously emotional event,

143
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,820
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,820
(Applause).

145
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,

146
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
and it also took panoramic pictures.

147
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,820
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.

149
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted

150
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
those other pictures taken from orbit to be.

151
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,820
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.

152
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,820
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.

153
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
And you can follow these channels

154
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
and you can see how they all converge.

155
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,820
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.

156
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
You are looking at a shoreline.

157
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.

158
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.

159
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.

160
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.

161
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.

162
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,

163
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
you would be flying at these altitudes.

164
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,820
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines

165
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)

166
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,820
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,

167
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,820
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.

169
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
And here is the horizon, OK?

170
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?

171
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
(Applause).

172
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions

173
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,820
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.

174
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
What the probe came down in was basically

175
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.

176
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.

177
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And it's probably the case that this material

178
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,820
has washed off the highlands of Titan

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
through these channels that we saw,

180
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,820
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.

181
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.

182
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,820
But still, there was no sign in our images,

183
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,820
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.

184
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.

185
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,

186
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,

187
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
separated by a few kilometers,

188
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.

189
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.

190
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.

191
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,820
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.

192
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,820
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,

193
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,820
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.

194
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,820
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.

195
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.

196
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
And then, only a week and a half ago,

197
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,

198
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,820
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.

199
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,

200
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,820
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.

201
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan

202
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,820
is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,

203
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
and having Earth-like geological formations

204
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
and a tremendous geographical diversity,

205
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system

206
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.

207
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,820
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,

208
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,820
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,

209
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.

210
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
(Laughter).

211
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,820
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,

212
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.

213
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
It is a very geologically active body.

214
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus

215
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --

216
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
where we found this system of fractures.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.

218
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,820
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.

219
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,

220
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,820
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.

221
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,820
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.

222
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered

223
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,820
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles

224
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
extending hundreds of miles into space.

225
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,

226
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,820
we see that these jets feed a plume

227
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,820
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles

228
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
into the space above Enceladus.

229
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
My team and I have examined images like this,

230
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,820
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.

231
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,820
And we have arrived at the conclusion

232
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
that these jets may be erupting from pockets

233
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,820
of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.

234
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,820
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.

235
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon

236
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,

237
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,820
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.

238
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life

239
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
elsewhere in our solar system,

240
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,

241
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.

242
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred

243
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,820
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,

244
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,820
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times

245
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,820
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.

246
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.

247
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
It is precious, it is unique,

248
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.

249
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,820
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --

250
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --

251
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
you would remember this very famous picture

252
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,820
taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.

253
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,

254
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,

255
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,820
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.

256
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,

257
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,820
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.

258
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,820
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.

259
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,

260
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,

261
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
you see the refracted image of the Sun

262
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
and you see this ring created, in fact,

263
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
by the exhalations of Enceladus.

264
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,820
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,

265
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
sight of our own planet,

266
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,820
cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.

267
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Now, there is something deeply moving

268
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
about seeing ourselves from afar,

269
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet

270
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
in the skies of other worlds.

271
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,

272
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,820
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn

273
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.

274
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
And thank you very much.

275
00:16:51,820 --> 00:17:03,820
(Applause)
