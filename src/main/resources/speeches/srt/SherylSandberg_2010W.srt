1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,161
So for any of us in this room today,
let's start out by admitting we're lucky.

2
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:20,012
We don't live in the world
our mothers lived in,

3
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,275
our grandmothers lived in,

4
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,787
where career choices
for women were so limited.

5
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:25,796
And if you're in this room today,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,564
most of us grew up in a world
where we have basic civil rights,

7
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:34,511
and amazingly, we still live in a world
where some women don't have them.

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,906
But all that aside,
we still have a problem,

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,145
and it's a real problem.

10
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,796
And the problem is this:

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,992
Women are not making it
to the top of any profession

12
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,388
anywhere in the world.

13
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,347
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.

14
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,409
190 heads of state --
nine are women.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,286
Of all the people
in parliament in the world,

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,159
13 percent are women.

17
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:00,462
In the corporate sector, women at the top,

18
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:02,796
C-level jobs, board seats --

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,561
tops out at 15, 16 percent.

20
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,537
The numbers have not moved since 2002

21
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,510
and are going in the wrong direction.

22
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:13,164
And even in the non-profit world,

23
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,460
a world we sometimes think of
as being led by more women,

24
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,796
women at the top: 20 percent.

25
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:21,260
We also have another problem,

26
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,674
which is that women face harder choices

27
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:26,796
between professional success
and personal fulfillment.

28
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:32,341
A recent study in the U.S.
showed that, of married senior managers,

29
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,796
two-thirds of the married men had children

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,526
and only one-third
of the married women had children.

31
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,499
A couple of years ago, I was in New York,

32
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,979
and I was pitching a deal,

33
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,354
and I was in one of those fancy
New York private equity offices

34
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:46,551
you can picture.

35
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:49,385
And I'm in the meeting --
it's about a three-hour meeting --

36
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,568
and two hours in,
there needs to be that bio break,

37
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:54,399
and everyone stands up,

38
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:57,709
and the partner running the meeting
starts looking really embarrassed.

39
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:02,354
And I realized he doesn't know
where the women's room is in his office.

40
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:04,921
So I start looking
around for moving boxes,

41
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:07,231
figuring they just moved in,
but I don't see any.

42
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:10,199
And so I said, "Did you just
move into this office?"

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,819
And he said, "No,
we've been here about a year."

44
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:17,550
And I said, "Are you telling me
that I am the only woman

45
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:20,356
to have pitched a deal
in this office in a year?"

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,406
And he looked at me, and he said,

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,011
"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one
who had to go to the bathroom."

48
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,434
(Laughter)

49
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,927
So the question is,
how are we going to fix this?

50
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:36,679
How do we change these numbers at the top?

51
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,796
How do we make this different?

52
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,076
I want to start out by saying,
I talk about this --

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,796
about keeping women in the workforce --

54
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,409
because I really think that's the answer.

55
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,695
In the high-income part of our workforce,

56
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,796
in the people who end up at the top --

57
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,796
Fortune 500 CEO jobs,
or the equivalent in other industries --

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,467
the problem, I am convinced,
is that women are dropping out.

59
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,796
Now people talk about this a lot,

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,834
and they talk about things
like flextime and mentoring

61
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,343
and programs companies
should have to train women.

62
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,272
I want to talk about none of that today,

63
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:12,298
even though that's all really important.

64
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:15,148
Today I want to focus
on what we can do as individuals.

65
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:17,796
What are the messages
we need to tell ourselves?

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,984
What are the messages we tell
the women that work with and for us?

67
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,093
What are the messages
we tell our daughters?

68
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:25,860
Now, at the outset,
I want to be very clear

69
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:27,966
that this speech comes with no judgments.

70
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,570
I don't have the right answer.

71
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,121
I don't even have it for myself.

72
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,796
I left San Francisco,
where I live, on Monday,

73
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,586
and I was getting on the plane
for this conference.

74
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,706
And my daughter, who's three,
when I dropped her off at preschool,

75
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,397
did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying,
"Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.

76
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:47,243
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.

77
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:48,796
I know no women,

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,630
whether they're at home
or whether they're in the workforce,

79
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,193
who don't feel that sometimes.

80
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:55,796
So I'm not saying
that staying in the workforce

81
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,645
is the right thing for everyone.

82
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,796
My talk today is about
what the messages are

83
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,177
if you do want to stay in the workforce,

84
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,796
and I think there are three.

85
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,323
One, sit at the table.

86
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,134
Two, make your partner a real partner.

87
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:14,796
And three, don't leave before you leave.

88
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,078
Number one: sit at the table.

89
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,499
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,

90
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,796
we hosted a very senior
government official,

91
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,041
and he came in to meet with senior execs

92
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,666
from around Silicon Valley.

93
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,356
And everyone kind of sat at the table.

94
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,952
He had these two women
who were traveling with him

95
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,796
pretty senior in his department,

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,106
and I kind of said to them,

97
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,344
"Sit at the table.
Come on, sit at the table,"

98
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,131
and they sat on the side of the room.

99
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:42,305
When I was in college, my senior year,

100
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,828
I took a course called
European Intellectual History.

101
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,059
Don't you love that kind
of thing from college?

102
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,796
I wish I could do that now.

103
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,796
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,

104
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,360
who was then a brilliant
literary student --

105
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:55,694
and went on to be a brilliant
literary scholar --

106
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:57,735
and my brother -- smart guy,

107
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,374
but a water-polo-playing pre-med,

108
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:00,796
who was a sophomore.

109
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,796
The three of us take this class together.

110
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:07,554
And then Carrie reads all the books
in the original Greek and Latin,

111
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:09,270
goes to all the lectures.

112
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:11,344
I read all the books in English

113
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:13,025
and go to most of the lectures.

114
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,796
My brother is kind of busy.

115
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,532
He reads one book of 12
and goes to a couple of lectures,

116
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,603
marches himself up to our room

117
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,104
a couple days before the exam
to get himself tutored.

118
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:27,358
The three of us go to the exam
together, and we sit down.

119
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,541
And we sit there for three hours --

120
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:31,946
and our little blue notebooks
-- yes, I'm that old.

121
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,185
We walk out, we look at each other,
and we say, "How did you do?"

122
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,686
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like
I didn't really draw out the main point

123
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,285
on the Hegelian dialectic."

124
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,234
And I say, "God, I really
wish I had really connected

125
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:46,473
John Locke's theory of property
with the philosophers that follow."

126
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,001
And my brother says,

127
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,940
"I got the top grade in the class."

128
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,909
(Laughter)

129
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,029
"You got the top grade in the class?

130
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,603
You don't know anything."

131
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,027
(Laughter)

132
00:05:57,051 --> 00:06:01,599
The problem with these stories
is that they show what the data shows:

133
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:05,113
women systematically
underestimate their own abilities.

134
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,796
If you test men and women,

135
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,414
and you ask them questions
on totally objective criteria like GPAs,

136
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,302
men get it wrong slightly high,

137
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,413
and women get it wrong slightly low.

138
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,796
Women do not negotiate
for themselves in the workforce.

139
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,796
A study in the last two years

140
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,437
of people entering
the workforce out of college

141
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:26,796
showed that 57 percent
of boys entering, or men, I guess,

142
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,221
are negotiating their first salary,

143
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:31,323
and only seven percent of women.

144
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,076
And most importantly,

145
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,796
men attribute their success to themselves,

146
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,474
and women attribute it
to other external factors.

147
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,193
If you ask men why they did a good job,

148
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,796
they'll say, "I'm awesome.

149
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,796
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,796
If you ask women why they did a good job,

151
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,796
what they'll say is someone helped them,

152
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,796
they got lucky, they worked really hard.

153
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,796
Why does this matter?

154
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,796
Boy, it matters a lot.

155
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,796
Because no one gets to the corner office

156
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,374
by sitting on the side, not at the table,

157
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:05,401
and no one gets the promotion

158
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,980
if they don't think
they deserve their success,

159
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,796
or they don't even understand
their own success.

160
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,436
I wish the answer were easy.

161
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,072
I wish I could go tell
all the young women I work for,

162
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,110
these fabulous women,

163
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:19,384
"Believe in yourself
and negotiate for yourself.

164
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:20,796
Own your own success."

165
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:23,222
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.

166
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,425
But it's not that simple.

167
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:29,300
Because what the data shows,
above all else, is one thing,

168
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,625
which is that success and likeability
are positively correlated for men

169
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:35,635
and negatively correlated for women.

170
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,675
And everyone's nodding,
because we all know this to be true.

171
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:42,796
There's a really good study
that shows this really well.

172
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,011
There's a famous Harvard
Business School study

173
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:46,668
on a woman named Heidi Roizen.

174
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:51,096
And she's an operator
in a company in Silicon Valley,

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,796
and she uses her contacts

176
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,356
to become a very successful
venture capitalist.

177
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,796
In 2002 -- not so long ago --

178
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,059
a professor who was then
at Columbia University

179
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,466
took that case
and made it [Howard] Roizen.

180
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,323
And he gave the case out, both of them,
to two groups of students.

181
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,279
He changed exactly one word:

182
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:10,796
"Heidi" to "Howard."

183
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,796
But that one word made
a really big difference.

184
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:15,998
He then surveyed the students,

185
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:18,688
and the good news was the students,
both men and women,

186
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:21,106
thought Heidi and Howard
were equally competent,

187
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,408
and that's good.

188
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,503
The bad news was
that everyone liked Howard.

189
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,527
He's a great guy.
You want to work for him.

190
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,551
You want to spend the day
fishing with him.

191
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,137
But Heidi? Not so sure.

192
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,026
She's a little out for herself.
She's a little political.

193
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,097
You're not sure
you'd want to work for her.

194
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,445
This is the complication.

195
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,130
We have to tell our daughters
and our colleagues,

196
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,838
we have to tell ourselves
to believe we got the A,

197
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,796
to reach for the promotion,
to sit at the table,

198
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,599
and we have to do it in a world

199
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:52,218
where, for them, there are sacrifices
they will make for that,

200
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,529
even though for their brothers,
there are not.

201
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,304
The saddest thing about all of this
is that it's really hard to remember this.

202
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,376
And I'm about to tell a story
which is truly embarrassing for me,

203
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,707
but I think important.

204
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,287
I gave this talk at Facebook
not so long ago

205
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:09,800
to about 100 employees,

206
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:12,872
and a couple hours later,
there was a young woman who works there

207
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:16,235
sitting outside my little desk,
and she wanted to talk to me.

208
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,402
I said, okay, and she sat down,
and we talked.

209
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,379
And she said, "I learned something today.

210
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,458
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."

211
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,831
"What do you mean?"

212
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,649
She said, "You're giving this talk,

213
00:09:25,673 --> 00:09:27,970
and you said you would take
two more questions.

214
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:30,074
I had my hand up with many other people,

215
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,693
and you took two more questions.

216
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:34,627
I put my hand down, and I noticed
all the women did the same,

217
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,580
and then you took more questions,

218
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:37,796
only from the men."

219
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,267
And I thought to myself,

220
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,096
"Wow, if it's me -- who cares
about this, obviously --

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,054
giving this talk --

222
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:50,796
and during this talk, I can't even notice
that the men's hands are still raised,

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,796
and the women's hands are still raised,

224
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,998
how good are we

225
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:56,726
as managers of our companies
and our organizations

226
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,275
at seeing that the men
are reaching for opportunities

227
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,346
more than women?"

228
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,487
We've got to get women
to sit at the table.

229
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,512
(Cheers)

230
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:07,744
(Applause)

231
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,091
Message number two:

232
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:11,002
Make your partner a real partner.

233
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,217
I've become convinced that we've made
more progress in the workforce

234
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,796
than we have in the home.

235
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,031
The data shows this very clearly.

236
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,999
If a woman and a man
work full-time and have a child,

237
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,376
the woman does twice the amount
of housework the man does,

238
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,796
and the woman does three times
the amount of childcare the man does.

239
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:35,017
So she's got three jobs
or two jobs, and he's got one.

240
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,068
Who do you think drops out
when someone needs to be home more?

241
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:42,444
The causes of this are really complicated,
and I don't have time to go into them.

242
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:46,404
And I don't think Sunday football-watching
and general laziness is the cause.

243
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,642
I think the cause is more complicated.

244
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,155
I think, as a society,

245
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,396
we put more pressure
on our boys to succeed

246
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,796
than we do on our girls.

247
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:56,302
I know men that stay home

248
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:59,393
and work in the home
to support wives with careers,

249
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,444
and it's hard.

250
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:03,796
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff
and I see the father there,

251
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,339
I notice that the other mommies
don't play with him.

252
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,796
And that's a problem,

253
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,006
because we have to make it
as important a job,

254
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,409
because it's the hardest job
in the world to work inside the home,

255
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:17,913
for people of both genders,

256
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:21,431
if we're going to even things out and let
women stay in the workforce.

257
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:22,796
(Applause)

258
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,059
Studies show that households
with equal earning

259
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,025
and equal responsibility

260
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,210
also have half the divorce rate.

261
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:32,418
And if that wasn't good enough motivation
for everyone out there,

262
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,255
they also have more --

263
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,089
how shall I say this on this stage?

264
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,796
They know each other more
in the biblical sense as well.

265
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,313
(Cheers)

266
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,272
Message number three:

267
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,796
Don't leave before you leave.

268
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,102
I think there's a really deep irony

269
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,211
to the fact that actions
women are taking --

270
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,796
and I see this all the time --

271
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,946
with the objective
of staying in the workforce

272
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,535
actually lead to their eventually leaving.

273
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,796
Here's what happens:

274
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,364
We're all busy. Everyone's busy.
A woman's busy.

275
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,796
And she starts thinking
about having a child,

276
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,796
and from the moment she starts
thinking about having a child,

277
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,344
she starts thinking
about making room for that child.

278
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,628
"How am I going to fit this
into everything else I'm doing?"

279
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:14,652
And literally from that moment,

280
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,970
she doesn't raise her hand anymore,

281
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:20,324
she doesn't look for a promotion,
she doesn't take on the new project,

282
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,325
she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."

283
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:23,623
She starts leaning back.

284
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,419
The problem is that --

285
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:29,007
let's say she got pregnant
that day, that day --

286
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,796
nine months of pregnancy,
three months of maternity leave,

287
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,970
six months to catch your breath --

288
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,456
Fast-forward two years,

289
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,440
more often -- and as I've seen it --

290
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:39,978
women start thinking
about this way earlier --

291
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,892
when they get engaged, or married,

292
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,064
when they start thinking
about having a child,

293
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,555
which can take a long time.

294
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,587
One woman came to see me about this.

295
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,340
She looked a little young.

296
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:52,698
And I said, "So are you and your husband
thinking about having a baby?"

297
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,684
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."

298
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,283
She didn't even have a boyfriend.

299
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,308
(Laughter)

300
00:12:57,332 --> 00:13:00,663
I said, "You're thinking about this
just way too early."

301
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,657
But the point is that what happens

302
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,329
once you start
kind of quietly leaning back?

303
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,129
Everyone who's been through this --

304
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,896
and I'm here to tell you,
once you have a child at home,

305
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,506
your job better be really good to go back,

306
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,673
because it's hard to leave
that kid at home.

307
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,561
Your job needs to be challenging.

308
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,251
It needs to be rewarding.

309
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,796
You need to feel like you're
making a difference.

310
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,796
And if two years ago
you didn't take a promotion

311
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,086
and some guy next to you did,

312
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,796
if three years ago you stopped
looking for new opportunities,

313
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,548
you're going to be bored

314
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,265
because you should have kept
your foot on the gas pedal.

315
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,427
Don't leave before you leave.

316
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,796
Stay in.

317
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,796
Keep your foot on the gas pedal,

318
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,451
until the very day you need to leave
to take a break for a child --

319
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,261
and then make your decisions.

320
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,194
Don't make decisions too far in advance,

321
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:54,936
particularly ones you're not
even conscious you're making.

322
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,072
My generation really, sadly,

323
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,367
is not going to change
the numbers at the top.

324
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,111
They're just not moving.

325
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:05,337
We are not going to get
to where 50 percent of the population --

326
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:08,028
in my generation, there will not
be 50 percent of [women]

327
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,559
at the top of any industry.

328
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,111
But I'm hopeful that future
generations can.

329
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:18,793
I think a world where half
of our countries and our companies

330
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,230
were run by women,
would be a better world.

331
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:24,635
It's not just because people would know
where the women's bathrooms are,

332
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,312
even though that would be very helpful.

333
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,083
I think it would be a better world.

334
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,338
I have two children.

335
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,934
I have a five-year-old son
and a two-year-old daughter.

336
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,057
I want my son to have a choice

337
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:39,153
to contribute fully
in the workforce or at home,

338
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:43,073
and I want my daughter
to have the choice to not just succeed,

339
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:45,796
but to be liked for her accomplishments.

340
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,930
Thank you.

341
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,820
(Applause)
