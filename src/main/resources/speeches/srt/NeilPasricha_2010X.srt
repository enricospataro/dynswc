1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
So the Awesome story:

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
It begins about 40 years ago,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And they got here in the late 1960s.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
and they settled into a new life.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
They saw their first dentist,

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
they ate their first hamburger,

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
and they had their first kids.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
My sister and I

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
grew up here,

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
We had close family,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
good friends, a quiet street.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
We grew up taking for granted

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
when they grew up --

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
things like power always on

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
in our houses,

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
things like schools across the street

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
and hospitals down the road

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and popsicles in the backyard.

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
We grew up, and we grew older.

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
I went to high school.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I graduated.

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
I found a girl, I settled down --

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
(Laughter)

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
but life was pretty good.

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Life was pretty good.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
2006 was a great year.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
I got married,

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
2007 was a great year.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
I graduated from school,

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
(Laughter)

47
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
So you can't actually see them,

48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
but it was breathtaking,

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
believe me.

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
(Laughter)

51
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

52
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
not just me.

54
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
First of all, the news was so heavy.

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

57
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
it was about ice caps melting,

58
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
wars going on around the world,

59
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
earthquakes, hurricanes

60
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

61
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
and then eventually did collapse,

62
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
and so many of us losing our homes,

63
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
or our jobs,

64
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
or our retirements,

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
or our livelihoods.

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.

68
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
My marriage wasn't going well,

69
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,820
and we just were growing further and further apart.

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
One day my wife came home from work

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
to have a very honest conversation.

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,820
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

75
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
until only a month later,

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
had been battling mental illness for some time.

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
And for those of you

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
you know how challenging it can be.

83
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

84
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
on a Sunday night.

85
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

86
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Very sadly, he took his own life.

88
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And it was a really heavy time.

89
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And as these dark clouds were circling me,

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and I was finding it really, really difficult

91
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
to think of anything good,

92
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
I said to myself that I really needed a way

93
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
to focus on the positive somehow.

94
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
So I came home from work one night,

95
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and I logged onto the computer,

96
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and I started up a tiny website

97
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
called 1000awesomethings.com.

98
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
I was trying to remind myself

99
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
but we just don't talk about enough --

101
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
things like waiters and waitresses

102
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
who bring you free refills without asking,

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
being the first table to get called up

104
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

105
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
and you get to be first in line --

108
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

109
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
(Laughter)

110
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
And slowly over time,

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
I started putting myself in a better mood.

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
I mean, 50,000 blogs

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
are started a day,

114
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And nobody read it except for my mom.

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket

117
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
and go up by 100 percent

118
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
when she forwarded it to my dad.

119
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
(Laughter)

120
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
And then I got excited

121
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
when it started getting tens of hits,

122
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens

123
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and then hundreds and then thousands

124
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
and then millions.

125
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

126
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
And then I got a phone call,

127
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

128
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,820
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

129
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
I was like, that sounds totally fake.

130
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
(Laughter)

131
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,820
(Applause)

132
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?

133
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
(Laughter)

134
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
and I ended up walking a red carpet

136
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

138
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
And the surprise

139
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
and just the amazement of that

140
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

141
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
when, in my inbox,

142
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
10 literary agents were waiting for me

143
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
to talk about putting this into a book.

144
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Flash-forward to the next year

145
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

146
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

147
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:17,820
(Applause)

148
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

149
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

150
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

151
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

152
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
So let's talk about those three As.

153
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Over the last few years,

154
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
I haven't had that much time to really think.

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

156
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

157
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
that helped me grow my website,

158
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
but also grow myself?"

159
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,

160
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
as three As.

161
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
They are Attitude, Awareness

162
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
and Authenticity.

163
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

164
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
So Attitude:

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Look, we're all going to get lumps,

166
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
and we're all going to get bumps.

167
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it

168
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

169
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
We will all have high highs

170
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
and big days and proud moments

171
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
of smiles on graduation stages,

172
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
father-daughter dances at weddings

173
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,

174
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
but between those high highs,

175
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.

176
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
but your husband might leave you,

178
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
your girlfriend could cheat,

179
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,

180
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,820
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.

181
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
It's not a happy thought,

182
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

183
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
or bad scenes.

184
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Your mom could get cancer,

185
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
your dad could get mean.

186
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
And there are times in life

187
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

188
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

189
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
and when that bad news washes over you,

190
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

191
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
I just really hope you feel

192
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
like you've always got two choices.

193
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
One, you can swirl and twirl

194
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
and gloom and doom forever,

195
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
or two, you can grieve

196
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
and then face the future

197
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
with newly sober eyes.

198
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,

199
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
no matter what pain hits you,

201
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
choosing to move forward and move on

202
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
and take baby steps into the future.

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
The second "A" is Awareness.

204
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I love hanging out with three year-olds.

205
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
I love the way that they see the world,

206
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
because they're seeing the world for the first time.

207
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

208
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

209
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
at their first baseball game

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

212
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and the smell of the hotdogs.

213
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

214
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

215
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
for Thanksgiving dinner.

216
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I love the way that they see the world,

217
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
because they're seeing the world

218
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
for the first time.

219
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Having a sense of awareness

220
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

221
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Because you all used to be three years old.

222
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

223
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

224
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
They're in there.

225
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And being aware is just about remembering

226
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
that you saw everything you've seen

227
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
for the first time once, too.

228
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
So there was a time when it was your first time ever

229
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery

231
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
and smelt the bakery air,

232
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket

233
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
and said, "Found money."

234
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
The last "A" is Authenticity.

235
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.

236
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Let's go all the way back to 1932

237
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,

238
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.

239
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,

240
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
grew up and grew into

241
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.

242
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
He's number 76 in the picture.

243
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."

244
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s

245
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
you did not want to go up against.

246
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
They were tough football players doing what they love,

247
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
which was crushing skulls

248
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
and separating shoulders on the football field.

249
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
But Rosey Grier also had

250
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
another passion.

251
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
In his deeply authentic self,

252
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
He loved knitting.

254
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,

255
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

256
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
That's what he said.

257
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

258
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
he started joining clubs.

259
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
And he even put out a book

260
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
(Laughter)

262
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
(Applause)

263
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
It's a great cover.

264
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

265
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
(Laughter)

266
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
And so what I love about this story

267
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
is that Rosey Grier

268
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
is just such an authentic person,

269
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
and that's what authenticity is all about.

270
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

271
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
And I think when you're authentic,

272
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
you end up following your heart,

273
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
and you put yourself in places

274
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
and situations and in conversations

275
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
that you love and that you enjoy.

276
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
You meet people that you like talking to.

277
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
You go places you've dreamt about.

278
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
And you end you end up following your heart

279
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
and feeling very fulfilled.

280
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
So those are the three A's.

281
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

282
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
to my parents coming to Canada.

283
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
I don't know what it would feel like

284
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

285
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I don't know, because I never did it,

286
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

287
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

288
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
and appreciating the small wonders

289
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
that you're starting to see in your new world.

290
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

291
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
you'd have to be really true to yourself

292
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

293
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk

294
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
for about 10 seconds right now,

295
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,

296
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
and my parents are sitting in the front row.

297
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.

298
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.

299
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:41,820
(Applause)

300
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story

301
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
of his first day in Canada.

302
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
And it's a great story, because what happened was

303
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,

304
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,

305
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.

306
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
(Laughter)

307
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch

308
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
for all the new immigrants to Canada.

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch

310
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
and there was this huge spread.

311
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

312
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
there was olives, those little white onions.

313
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

314
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

315
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
and little cubes of cheese.

316
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

317
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
and salmon salad sandwiches.

318
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

319
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

320
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

321
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

322
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,820
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

323
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
(Laughter)

324
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

325
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I was eating olives with pie.

326
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
(Laughter)

327
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

328
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
(Laughter)

329
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
When I was five years old,

330
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

331
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
and he would stare in wonder

332
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

333
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

334
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

335
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

336
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

337
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

338
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
Is this A&P?"

339
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

340
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

341
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

342
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

343
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
And when we did, my dad would say,

344
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

345
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

346
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
drove it all the way to the docks

347
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
and then sailed it all the way

348
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
across the Atlantic Ocean

349
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
and then put it in another truck

350
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,

351
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"

352
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."

353
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.

354
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."

355
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.

356
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
There are so many things to be happy about.

357
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
We are the only species

358
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
on the only life-giving rock

359
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,

360
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
capable of experiencing

361
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
so many of these things.

362
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.

363
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.

364
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,

365
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
interior design and horoscope signs.

366
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.

367
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.

368
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.

369
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,

370
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.

371
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
You can sleep in clean sheets.

372
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
You can go to the movies and get good seats.

373
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,

374
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

375
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
We've got all that,

376
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.

377
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
And that's the sad part.

378
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
The cashiers at your grocery store,

379
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
the foreman at your plant,

380
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,

381
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,

382
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
every teacher you've ever had,

383
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,

384
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
every politician in every country,

385
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
every actor in every movie,

386
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
every single person in your family, everyone you love,

387
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
everyone in this room and you

388
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,820
will be dead in a hundred years.

389
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Life is so great that we only get such a short time

390
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
to experience and enjoy

391
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.

392
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
And that moment is right now,

393
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
and those moments are counting down,

394
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

395
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,820
You will never be as young as you are right now.

396
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

397
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
with a great attitude,

398
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
choosing to move forward and move on

399
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
whenever life deals you a blow,

400
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

401
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
embracing your inner three year-old

402
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

403
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
and being authentic to yourself,

404
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
being you and being cool with that,

405
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,

406
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
then I think you'll live a life

407
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
that is rich and is satisfying,

408
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.

409
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Thank you.
