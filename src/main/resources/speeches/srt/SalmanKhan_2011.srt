1
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:15,796
Khan Academy is most known
for its collection of videos,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,796
so before I go any further,

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,159
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

4
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:24,255
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be five.

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,572
This animal's fossils are only found
in this area of South America --

6
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,176
a nice clean band here --

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,389
and this part of Africa.

8
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:33,579
We can integrate over the surface,

9
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:36,444
and the notation
usually is a capital sigma.

10
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:39,634
National Assembly: They create
the Committee of Public Safety,

11
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,619
which sounds like a very nice committee.

12
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:45,348
Notice, this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.

13
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:48,617
Start differentiating
into effector and memory cells.

14
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:52,361
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.
Oh, look! There's another galaxy.

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,796
And for dollars, is their 30 million,

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,859
plus the 20 million dollars
from the American manufacturer.

17
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:01,383
If this does not blow your mind,

18
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:03,414
then you have no emotion.

19
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,796
(Laughter)

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,335
(Applause)

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,340
(Live) SK: We now have
on the order of 2,200 videos,

22
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:18,555
covering everything from basic arithmetic,
all the way to vector calculus,

23
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,796
and some of the stuff
that you saw up there.

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,224
We have a million students
a month using the site,

25
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:27,796
watching on the order
of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,470
But what we're going to talk about in this
is how we're going to the next level.

27
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:33,796
But before I do that,

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,184
I want to talk a little bit
about really just how I got started.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,041
And some of you all might know,

30
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:43,086
about five years ago,
I was an analyst at a hedge fund,

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,578
and I was in Boston,

32
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,690
and I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans, remotely.

33
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:51,055
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,

34
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,913
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,

35
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:55,062
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,

36
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:58,094
something that might give them
a refresher or something.

37
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,758
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,

38
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,286
something interesting happened.

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,654
Actually, a bunch of interesting
things happened.

40
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,916
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.

41
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:12,268
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

42
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:18,820
(Laughter)

43
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:23,583
And once you get over
the backhanded nature of that,

44
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,915
there was actually something
very profound there.

45
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,765
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin

46
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:30,939
to their cousin.

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,889
At first it's very unintuitive,

48
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:36,671
but when you think about it from their
point of view, it makes a ton of sense.

49
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:40,515
You have this situation where now
they can pause and repeat their cousin,

50
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,563
without feeling
like they're wasting my time.

51
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,959
If they have to review something

52
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,538
that they should have learned
a couple of weeks ago,

53
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:50,784
or maybe a couple of years ago,

54
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,466
they don't have to be embarrassed
and ask their cousin.

55
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,832
They can just watch those videos;
if they're bored, they can go ahead.

56
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,880
They can watch at their own time and pace.

57
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:03,705
Probably the least-appreciated aspect
of this

58
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,300
is the notion that the very first time

59
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:10,172
that you're trying to get
your brain around a new concept,

60
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,796
the very last thing you need

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,562
is another human being saying,
"Do you understand this?"

62
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,408
And that's what was happening

63
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,527
with the interaction
with my cousins before,

64
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:24,057
and now they can just do it
in the intimacy of their own room.

65
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,830
The other thing that happened is --

66
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:29,668
I put them on YouTube just --

67
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,170
I saw no reason to make it private,

68
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,796
so I let other people watch it,

69
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,796
and then people started stumbling on it,

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,318
and I started getting
some comments and some letters

71
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,548
and all sorts of feedback

72
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,508
from random people around the world.

73
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,206
These are just a few.

74
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,508
This is actually from one
of the original calculus videos.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,081
Someone wrote it on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment:

76
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:55,796
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."

77
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,716
(Laughter)

78
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,542
Let's pause here.

79
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,518
This person did a derivative,

80
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,719
and then they smiled.

81
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,524
(Laughter)

82
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,231
In response to that same comment --

83
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:10,706
this is on the thread, you can go
on YouTube and look at the comments --

84
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,508
someone else wrote: "Same thing here.

85
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,605
I actually got a natural high
and a good mood for the entire day,

86
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,057
since I remember seeing
all of this matrix text in class,

87
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,796
and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,081
(Laughter)

89
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,456
We get a lot of feedback
along those lines.

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,161
This clearly was helping people.

91
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:34,887
But then, as the viewership
kept growing and kept growing,

92
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,482
I started getting letters from people,

93
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,243
and it was starting to become clear

94
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,349
that it was more than just a nice-to-have.

95
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:44,796
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters:

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,291
"My 12 year-old son has autism,

97
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:49,537
and has had a terrible time with math.

98
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,796
We have tried everything,

99
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,796
viewed everything, bought everything.

100
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,505
We stumbled on your video
on decimals, and it got through.

101
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,513
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.

102
00:04:58,537 --> 00:04:59,688
Again, he got it.

103
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:00,878
We could not believe it.

104
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,119
He is so excited."

105
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,370
And so you can imagine,

106
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:08,528
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --

107
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:11,821
it was very strange for me to do
something of social value.

108
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,796
(Laughter)

109
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,500
(Applause)

110
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:23,796
But I was excited, so I kept going.

111
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,518
And then a few other things
started to dawn on me;

112
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,010
that not only would it
help my cousins right now,

113
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:31,089
or these people who were sending letters,

114
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:33,985
but that this content will never grow old,

115
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,303
that it could help their kids
or their grandkids.

116
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:42,089
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,

117
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:43,351
I wouldn't have to.

118
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,160
(Laughter)

119
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,796
Assuming he was good. We don't know.

120
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,422
(Laughter)

121
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:53,486
The other thing that happened --
and even at this point, I said,

122
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,724
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.
It's good for motivated students.

123
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,574
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."

124
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:01,873
But I didn't think it would somehow
penetrate the classroom.

125
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,023
Then I started getting
letters from teachers,

126
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,872
and the teachers would write, saying,

127
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,117
"We've used your videos
to flip the classroom.

128
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:10,718
You've given the lectures,
so now what we do --"

129
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:14,280
And this could happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow --

130
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:17,558
"what I do is I assign
the lectures for homework,

131
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:19,605
and what used to be homework,

132
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,581
I now have the students
doing in the classroom."

133
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:25,073
And I want to pause here --

134
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:29,690
(Applause)

135
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,011
I want to pause here, because there's
a couple of interesting things.

136
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:35,236
One, when those teachers are doing that,

137
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,796
there's the obvious benefit --

138
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,320
the benefit that now their students

139
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:41,866
can enjoy the videos in the way
that my cousins did,

140
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,296
they can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.

141
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,501
But the more interesting thing --
and this is the unintuitive thing

142
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,903
when you talk about technology
in the classroom --

143
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,813
by removing the one-size-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,

144
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,837
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home,

145
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:58,512
then when you go to the classroom,

146
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,036
letting them do work,
having the teacher walk around,

147
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,146
having the peers actually be able
to interact with each other,

148
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,804
these teachers have used technology
to humanize the classroom.

149
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,290
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience --

150
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,805
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,

151
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,783
not allowed to interact with each other.

152
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,299
A teacher, no matter how good,

153
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:21,632
has to give this one-size-fits-all
lecture to 30 students --

154
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:24,019
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --

155
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,614
and now it's a human experience,

156
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,947
now they're actually
interacting with each other.

157
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,756
So once the Khan Academy --

158
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,932
I quit my job,

159
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:34,400
and we turned into a real organization --

160
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,217
we're a not-for-profit --

161
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,335
the question is, how do we take this
to the next level?

162
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,867
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?

163
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,796
And so, what I'm showing over here,

164
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,454
these are actual exercises

165
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,796
that I started writing for my cousins.

166
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,916
The ones I started
were much more primitive.

167
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,310
This is a more competent version of it.

168
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,723
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
as many questions as you need,

169
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:01,796
until you get that concept,
until you get 10 in a row.

170
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,796
And the Khan Academy videos are there.

171
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,153
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,

172
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:08,134
if you don't know how to do it.

173
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,468
The paradigm here seems
like a very simple thing:

174
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,690
10 in a row, you move on.

175
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:13,294
But it's fundamentally different

176
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,605
than what's happening
in classrooms right now.

177
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,531
In a traditional classroom,

178
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,796
you have homework, lecture,
homework, lecture,

179
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,659
and then you have a snapshot exam.

180
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:26,340
And that exam, whether you get
a 70 percent, an 80 percent,

181
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,809
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,

182
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,276
the class moves on to the next topic.

183
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,045
And even that 95 percent student --

184
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,078
what was the five percent
they didn't know?

185
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,923
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zeroth power.

186
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,196
Then you build on that
in the next concept.

187
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,560
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

188
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,453
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,

189
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:50,390
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
then I come back after two weeks,

190
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:53,564
and say, "Well, let's see.
You're having trouble taking left turns.

191
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:56,825
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."

192
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,271
So I put a big "C" stamp
on your forehead --

193
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:00,357
(Laughter)

194
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,143
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."

195
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,261
(Laughter)

196
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,120
But as ridiculous as that sounds,

197
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,796
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

198
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,429
And the idea is you fast forward

199
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,439
and good students start failing
algebra all of the sudden,

200
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,767
and start failing
calculus all of the sudden,

201
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,149
despite being smart,
despite having good teachers,

202
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,917
and it's usually because they have
these Swiss cheese gaps

203
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,150
that kept building
throughout their foundation.

204
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:27,752
So our model is: learn math
the way you'd learn anything,

205
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,122
like riding a bicycle.

206
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:32,217
Stay on that bicycle.
Fall off that bicycle.

207
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:35,272
Do it as long as necessary,
until you have mastery.

208
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,796
The traditional model,

209
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,392
it penalizes you
for experimentation and failure,

210
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,439
but it does not expect mastery.

211
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,527
We encourage you to experiment.
We encourage you to fail.

212
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,201
But we do expect mastery.

213
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,661
This is just another one of the modules.

214
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:51,105
This is trigonometry.

215
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,644
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

216
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:55,795
And they all fit together.

217
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,777
We have about 90 of these right now.

218
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,410
You can go to the site right now,

219
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,506
it's all free,
not trying to sell anything.

220
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,670
But the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map.

221
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,813
That top node right there,
that's literally single-digit addition,

222
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:10,112
it's like one plus one is equal to two.

223
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,488
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,

224
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,695
it keeps forwarding you
to more and more advanced modules.

225
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,798
Further down the knowledge map,

226
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,069
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

227
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,266
Further down, you start getting
into pre-algebra and early algebra.

228
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,033
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,

229
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:29,589
a little bit of precalculus.

230
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,159
And the idea is, from this we can
actually teach everything --

231
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:37,025
well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.

232
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,858
So you can imagine -- and this
is what we are working on --

233
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:43,445
from this knowledge map, you have
logic, you have computer programming,

234
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:45,969
you have grammar, you have genetics,

235
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,152
all based off of that core of,
if you know this and that,

236
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,516
now you're ready for this next concept.

237
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,731
Now that can work well
for an individual learner,

238
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,887
and I encourage you
to do it with your kids,

239
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,950
but I also encourage everyone
in the audience to do it yourself.

240
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,176
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.

241
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,356
But what we want to do

242
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,458
is use the natural conclusion
of the flipping of the classroom

243
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,855
that those early teachers
had emailed me about.

244
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,472
And so what I'm showing you here,

245
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:13,384
this is data from a pilot
in the Los Altos school district,

246
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:16,724
where they took two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes,

247
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:18,999
and completely gutted
their old math curriculum.

248
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:22,458
These kids aren't using textbooks,
or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.

249
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,475
They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
for roughly half of their math class.

250
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:29,706
I want to be clear: we don't view this
as a complete math education.

251
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,628
What it does is -- this is
what's happening in Los Altos --

252
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,053
it frees up time --
it's the blocking and tackling,

253
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:38,053
making sure you know how to move
through a system of equations,

254
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,712
and it frees up time
for the simulations, for the games,

255
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:42,752
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,

256
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,658
for the estimating how high
that hill is based on its shadow.

257
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,238
And so the paradigm is
the teacher walks in every day,

258
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,040
every kid works at their own pace --

259
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,595
this is actually a live dashboard
from the Los Altos school district --

260
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,190
and they look at this dashboard.

261
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,904
Every row is a student.

262
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,796
Every column is one of those concepts.

263
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,963
Green means the student's
already proficient.

264
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,511
Blue means they're working
on it -- no need to worry.

265
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,796
Red means they're stuck.

266
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,493
And what the teacher does
is literally just say,

267
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,192
"Let me intervene on the red kids."

268
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,581
Or even better, "Let me get
one of the green kids,

269
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,651
who are already proficient
in that concept,

270
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:18,188
to be the first line of attack,
and actually tutor their peer."

271
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,421
(Applause)

272
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,796
Now, I come from a very
data-centric reality,

273
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,559
so we don't want that teacher
to even go and intervene

274
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,629
and have to ask the kid awkward questions:

275
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,963
"What don't you understand? What do
you understand?" and all the rest.

276
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:40,222
So our paradigm is to arm teachers
with as much data as possible --

277
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,296
data that, in any other
field, is expected,

278
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,359
in finance, marketing, manufacturing --

279
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:47,180
so the teachers can diagnose
what's wrong with the students

280
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:50,092
so they can make their interaction
as productive as possible.

281
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:52,950
Now teachers know exactly
what the students have been up to,

282
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,859
how long they've spent each day,
what videos they've watched,

283
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,717
when did they pause the videos,
what did they stop watching,

284
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,464
what exercises are they using,
what have they focused on?

285
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:04,361
The outer circle shows
what exercises they were focused on.

286
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:07,090
The inner circle shows
the videos they're focused on.

287
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,138
The data gets pretty granular,

288
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,249
so you can see the exact problems
the student got right or wrong.

289
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,002
Red is wrong, blue is right.

290
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,000
The leftmost question is the first one
the student attempted.

291
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,666
They watched the video over there.

292
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,634
And you can see, eventually
they were able to get 10 in a row.

293
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:25,013
It's almost like you can see them
learning over those last 10 problems.

294
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,124
They also got faster -- the height
is how long it took them.

295
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:34,540
When you talk about self-paced learning,
it makes sense for everyone --

296
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,985
in education-speak,
"differentiated learning" --

297
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,691
but it's kind of crazy, what happens
when you see it in a classroom.

298
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:45,159
Because every time we've done this,
in every classroom we've done,

299
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:47,507
over and over again,
if you go five days into it,

300
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,544
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead

301
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,481
and a group who are a little bit slower.

302
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:53,908
In a traditional model,
in a snapshot assessment,

303
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,844
you say, "These are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.

304
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,836
Maybe they should be tracked differently.

305
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,090
Maybe we should put them
in different classes."

306
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:03,518
But when you let students
work at their own pace --

307
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,143
we see it over and over again --

308
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,592
you see students who took
a little bit extra time

309
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,467
on one concept or the other,

310
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:11,687
but once they get through that concept,

311
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,059
they just race ahead.

312
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,455
And so the same kids that you
thought were slow six weeks ago,

313
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,138
you now would think are gifted.

314
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:20,154
And we're seeing it over and over again.

315
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,963
It makes you really wonder

316
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,286
how much all of the labels maybe
a lot of us have benefited from

317
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,892
were really just due
to a coincidence of time.

318
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:36,079
Now as valuable as something like this is
in a district like Los Altos,

319
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:37,796
our goal is to use technology

320
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,796
to humanize, not just in Los Altos,
but on a global scale,

321
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,323
what's happening in education.

322
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:45,648
And that brings up an interesting point.

323
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:48,402
A lot of the effort
in humanizing the classroom

324
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:51,346
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.

325
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,869
In our mind, the relevant metric is:

326
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,795
student-to-valuable-human-time-
with-the-teacher ratio.

327
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,344
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time

328
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,740
is spent doing lectures
and grading and whatnot.

329
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:05,660
Maybe five percent of their time
is sitting next to students

330
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:06,844
and working with them.

331
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,875
Now, 100 percent of their time is.

332
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,169
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,

333
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:14,551
you're humanizing
the classroom, I'd argue,

334
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:16,589
by a factor of five or 10.

335
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,946
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,

336
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,011
imagine what it does to the adult learner,

337
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,098
who's embarrassed to go back
and learn stuff

338
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,574
they should have known
before going back to college.

339
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:31,531
Imagine what it does
to a street kid in Calcutta,

340
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,297
who has to help his family during the day,

341
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,727
and that's the reason
he or she can't go to school.

342
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,234
Now they can spend two hours
a day and remediate,

343
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,583
or get up to speed
and not feel embarrassed

344
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,796
about what they do or don't know.

345
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,854
Now imagine what happens where --

346
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,789
we talked about the peers
teaching each other

347
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,622
inside of a classroom.

348
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,376
But this is all one system.

349
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,702
There's no reason why you can't
have that peer-to-peer tutoring

350
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:57,796
beyond that one classroom.

351
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,796
Imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta

352
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,988
all of the sudden can tutor your son,

353
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,473
or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.

354
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,796
And I think what you'll see emerging

355
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,723
is this notion of a global
one-world classroom.

356
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:17,796
And that's essentially
what we're trying to build.

357
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:19,534
Thank you.

358
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:26,469
(Applause)

359
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,216
Bill Gates: I'll ask about two
or three questions.

360
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,962
Salman Khan: Oh, OK.

361
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,319
(Applause continues)

362
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:00,880
(Applause ends)

363
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:03,840
BG: I've seen some things
you're doing in the system,

364
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,301
that have to do with motivation
and feedback --

365
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,796
energy points, merit badges.

366
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,851
Tell me what you're thinking there.

367
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,471
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have
an awesome team working on it.

368
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,598
I have to be clear,
it's not just me anymore.

369
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,107
I'm still doing all the videos,

370
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:19,433
but we have a rock-star team
doing the software.

371
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,616
We've put a bunch of game mechanics
in there, where you get badges,

372
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,899
we're going to start having leader boards
by area, you get points.

373
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,749
It's actually been pretty interesting.

374
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:29,332
Just the wording of the badging,

375
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,563
or how many points you get
for doing something,

376
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:33,224
we see on a system-wide basis,

377
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:35,886
like tens of thousands
of fifth-graders or sixth-graders

378
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,085
going one direction or another,
depending what badge you give them.

379
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,172
(Laughter)

380
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:43,796
BG: And the collaboration
you're doing with Los Altos,

381
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,997
how did that come about?

382
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:49,060
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.

383
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,893
Once again, I didn't expect it
to be used in classrooms.

384
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,796
Someone from their board came and said,

385
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,647
"What would you do if you had
carte Blanche in a classroom?"

386
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,687
I said, "Well, every student
would work at their own pace,

387
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,908
on something like this,
we'd give a dashboard."

388
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,131
They said, "This is kind of radical.
We have to think about it."

389
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:08,957
Me and the rest of the team were like,
"They're never going to want to do this."

390
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:12,402
But literally the next day they were like,
"Can you start in two weeks?"

391
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,877
(Laughter)

392
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:16,798
BG: So fifth-grade math
is where that's going on right now?

393
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:19,821
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes.

394
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,711
They're doing it at the district level.

395
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,807
I think what they're excited about
is they can follow these kids,

396
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:28,244
not only in school; on Christmas,
we saw some of the kids were doing it.

397
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:31,796
We can track everything, track them
as they go through the entire district.

398
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,748
Through the summers, as they go
from one teacher to the next,

399
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:38,572
you have this continuity of data that
even at the district level, they can see.

400
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:41,796
BG: So some of those views we saw
were for the teacher

401
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,511
to go in and track actually
what's going on with those kids.

402
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,861
So you're getting feedback
on those teacher views

403
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,598
to see what they think they need?

404
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:53,978
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those
were specs by the teachers.

405
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:57,012
We made some of those for students
so they could see their data,

406
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,148
but we have a very tight design loop
with the teachers themselves.

407
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,396
And they're saying,
"Hey, this is nice, but --"

408
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,809
Like that focus graph,
a lot of the teachers said,

409
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,373
"I have a feeling a lot of the kids
are jumping around

410
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,999
and not focusing on one topic."

411
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,496
So we made that focus diagram.

412
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,160
So it's all been teacher-driven.
It's been pretty crazy.

413
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,757
BG: Is this ready for prime time?

414
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:19,135
Do you think a lot of classes next school
year should try this thing out?

415
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,317
SK: Yeah, it's ready.

416
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:23,059
We've got a million people
on the site already,

417
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,015
so we can handle a few more.

418
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,796
(Laughter)

419
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,796
No, no reason why it really can't happen

420
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,430
in every classroom in America tomorrow.

421
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,934
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.

422
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,796
The idea there is,
if I'm confused about a topic,

423
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,972
somehow right in the user interface,

424
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,132
I'd find people who are volunteering,

425
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:43,894
maybe see their reputation,

426
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:47,095
and I could schedule and connect up
with those people?

427
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,868
SK: Absolutely. And this is something
I recommend everyone in this audience do.

428
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,954
Those dashboards the teachers have,
you can go log in right now

429
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:55,796
and you can essentially become a coach

430
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,796
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,

431
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,649
or maybe some kids
at the Boys and Girls Club.

432
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:04,205
And yeah, you can start
becoming a mentor, a tutor,

433
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:05,701
really immediately.

434
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,118
But yeah, it's all there.

435
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,868
BG: Well, it's amazing.

436
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,954
I think you just got a glimpse
of the future of education.

437
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,796
BG: Thank you.
SK: Thank you.

438
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,542
(Applause)
