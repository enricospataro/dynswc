1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I'd like to take you to another world.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
And I'd like to share

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
a 45 year-old love story

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
with the poor,

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
living on less than one dollar a day.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,820
I went to a very elitist, snobbish,

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,820
expensive education in India,

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
and that almost destroyed me.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I was all set

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,820
all laid out.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
for three years.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
(Laughter)

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
The whole world was laid out for me.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Everything was at my feet.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
I could do nothing wrong.

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
And then I thought out of curiosity

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I'd like to go and live and work

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
and just see what a village is like.

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
So in 1965,

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,820
I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
and I saw starvation, death,

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
people dying of hunger, for the first time.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
It changed my life.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
I came back home,

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
told my mother,

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
"I'd like to live and work in a village."

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Mother went into a coma.

30
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
(Laughter)

31
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
"What is this?

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
and you want to go and work in a village?

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
It made me think.

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
And I wanted to give something back

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
in my own way."

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
"What do you want to do in a village?

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
No job, no money,

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
no security, no prospect."

42
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
I said, "I want to live

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
and dig wells for five years."

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
"Dig wells for five years?

45
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
You went to the most expensive school and college in India,

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and you want to dig wells for five years?"

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,820
She didn't speak to me for a very long time,

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
because she thought I'd let my family down.

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
But then,

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
that very poor people have,

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
which are never brought into the mainstream --

53
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
which is never identified, respected,

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
applied on a large scale.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --

56
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
college only for the poor.

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
What the poor thought was important

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
would be reflected in the college.

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
I went to this village for the first time.

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Elders came to me

61
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
and said, "Are you running from the police?"

62
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
I said, "No."

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
(Laughter)

64
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
"You failed in your exam?"

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I said, "No."

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."

67
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
"What are you doing here?

68
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Why are you here?

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
The education system in India

70
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;

71
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
what are you doing in this village?

72
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
I said, "No, I want to actually start a college

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
only for the poor.

75
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."

76
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
They said, "Please,

78
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification

79
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
into your college."

80
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
So it's the only college in India

81
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,

82
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
you are disqualified to come.

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,820
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout

84
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
to come to our college.

85
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
You have to work with your hands.

86
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
You have to have a dignity of labor.

87
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community

88
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and provide a service to the community.

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So we started the Barefoot College,

90
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
and we redefined professionalism.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Who is a professional?

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
A professional is someone

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
who has a combination of competence,

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
confidence and belief.

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
A water diviner is a professional.

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
A traditional midwife

97
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
is a professional.

98
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
A traditional bone setter is a professional.

99
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
These are professionals all over the world.

100
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,820
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.

101
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream

102
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
and show that the knowledge and skills that they have

103
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
is universal.

104
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
It needs to be used, needs to be applied,

105
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
needs to be shown to the world outside --

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
that these knowledge and skills

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,820
are relevant even today.

108
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
So the college works

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,820
following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.

110
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,820
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.

111
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
There are no contracts, no written contracts.

112
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.

113
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
And no one can get more than $100 a month.

114
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.

115
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
You come for the work and the challenge,

116
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
you'll come to the Barefoot College.

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.

119
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
It doesn't matter if you fail.

120
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Battered, bruised, you start again.

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner

122
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
and the learner is the teacher.

123
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.

124
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
You are certified by the community you serve.

125
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall

126
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
to show that you are an engineer.

127
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
So when I said that,

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?

129
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,820
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
So we built the first Barefoot College

131
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
in 1986.

132
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects

133
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
who can't read and write,

134
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
built on $1.50 a sq. ft.

135
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,820
150 people lived there, worked there.

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.

137
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,

139
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,820
but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."

140
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,

141
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
because they didn't believe us,

142
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions

143
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.

144
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
I asked a forester --

145
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
high-powered, paper-qualified expert --

146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
I said, "What can you build in this place?"

147
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.

148
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Not even worth it.

149
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
No water, rocky soil."

150
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
I was in a bit of a spot.

151
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village

152
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"

153
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
He looked quietly at me and said,

154
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."

155
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
This is what it looks like today.

156
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
Went to the roof,

157
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
and all the women said, "Clear out.

158
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.

159
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
This is waterproofing the roof."

160
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
(Laughter)

161
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens

162
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
and a bit of other things I don't know.

163
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
But it actually doesn't leak.

164
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.

165
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
This technology, the women will not share with the men.

166
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
(Laughter)

167
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
It's the only college

168
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,820
which is fully solar-electrified.

169
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
All the power comes from the sun.

170
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.

171
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.

172
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
So long as the sun shines,

173
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
we'll have no problem with power.

174
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
But the beauty is

175
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
that is was installed

176
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
by a priest, a Hindu priest,

177
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
who's only done eight years of primary schooling --

178
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
never been to school, never been to college.

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
He knows more about solar

180
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,820
than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.

181
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,

182
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
is solar cooked.

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
are women,

185
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
illiterate women,

186
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
who actually fabricate

187
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
the most sophisticated solar cooker.

188
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Unfortunately, they're almost half German,

190
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
they're so precise.

191
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
(Laughter)

192
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
You'll never find Indian women so precise.

193
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Absolutely to the last inch,

194
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
they can make that cooker.

195
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
And we have 60 meals twice a day

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
of solar cooking.

197
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
We have a dentist --

198
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.

199
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
She actually looks after the teeth

200
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
of 7,000 children.

201
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Barefoot technology:

202
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --

203
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.

204
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Very little water is wasted.

205
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
All the roofs are connected underground

206
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
to a 400,000 liter tank,

207
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and no water is wasted.

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
because we collect rainwater.

210
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
60 percent of children don't go to school,

211
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
because they have to look after animals --

212
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
sheep, goats --

213
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
domestic chores.

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
So we thought of starting a school

215
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
at night for the children.

216
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Because the night schools of Tilonia,

217
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Because it's for the convenience of the child;

219
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
it's not for the convenience of the teacher.

220
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
And what do we teach in these schools?

221
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Democracy, citizenship,

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
how you should measure your land,

223
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
what you should do if you're arrested,

224
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
what you should do if your animal is sick.

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
This is what we teach in the night schools.

226
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
But all the schools are solar-lit.

227
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Every five years

228
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
we have an election.

229
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Between six to 14 year-old children

230
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
participate in a democratic process,

231
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
and they elect a prime minister.

232
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
The prime minister is 12 years old.

233
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
She looks after 20 goats in the morning,

234
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
but she's prime minister in the evening.

235
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
She has a cabinet,

236
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.

237
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
And they actually monitor and supervise

238
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
150 schools for 7,000 children.

239
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,

240
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
and she went to Sweden.

241
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
First time ever going out of her village.

242
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Never seen Sweden.

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.

244
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,

245
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?

246
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
She's only 12 years old,

247
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
and she's not dazzled by anything."

248
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
And the girl, who's on her left,

249
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye

250
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."

251
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
(Laughter)

252
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,820
(Applause)

253
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,

254
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
we use puppetry.

255
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Puppets is the way we communicate.

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
You have Jokhim Chacha

257
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
who is 300 years old.

258
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.

259
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.

260
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
He's my donor.

261
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
He actually raises money,

262
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
solves my disputes.

263
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
He solves my problems in the village.

264
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
If there's tension in the village,

265
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
if attendance at the schools goes down

266
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,

267
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village

268
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
and says, "Shake hands.

269
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
The attendance must not drop."

270
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
These puppets

271
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
are made out of recycled World Bank reports.

272
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
(Laughter)

273
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,820
(Applause)

274
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
So this decentralized, demystified approach

275
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
of solar-electrifying villages,

276
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
we've covered all over India

277
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
from Ladakh up to Bhutan --

278
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
all solar-electrified villages

279
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
by people who have been trained.

280
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
And we went to Ladakh,

281
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
and we asked this woman --

282
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,

283
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --

284
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
and we asked this woman,

285
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
"What was the benefit you had

286
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
from solar electricity?"

287
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
And she thought for a minute and said,

288
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,820
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."

289
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
(Laughter)

290
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Went to Afghanistan.

291
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,820
One lesson we learned in India

292
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,820
was men are untrainable.

293
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
(Laughter)

294
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Men are restless,

295
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
men are ambitious,

296
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
men are compulsively mobile,

297
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
and they all want a certificate.

298
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
(Laughter)

299
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
All across the globe, you have this tendency

300
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
of men wanting a certificate.

301
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Why? Because they want to leave the village

302
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
and go to a city, looking for a job.

303
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
So we came up with a great solution:

304
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
train grandmothers.

305
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
What's the best way of communicating

306
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
in the world today?

307
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Television? No.

308
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Telegraph? No.

309
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Telephone? No.

310
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Tell a woman.

311
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
(Laughter)

312
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,820
(Applause)

313
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,

314
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and we picked three women

315
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and said, "We want to take them to India."

316
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,

317
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
and you want to take them to India."

318
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."

319
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
So I took the husbands along.

320
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.

321
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
In six months,

322
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
how do we train these women?

323
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Sign language.

324
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
You don't choose the written word.

325
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
You don't choose the spoken word.

326
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
You use sign language.

327
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
And in six months

328
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,820
they can become solar engineers.

329
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.

330
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
This woman went back

331
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
and solar-electrified the first village,

332
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
set up a workshop --

333
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan

334
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
[was] by the three women.

335
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
This woman

336
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
is an extraordinary grandmother.

337
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,820
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.

338
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
And they haven't collapsed.

339
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan

340
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
and told the head of the department

341
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
the difference between AC and DC.

342
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
He didn't know.

343
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Those three women have trained 27 more women

344
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.

345
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
We went to Africa,

346
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
and we did the same thing.

347
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,

348
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,

349
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
because they're all speaking a different language.

350
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
But their body language is great.

351
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
They're speaking to each other

352
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
and actually becoming solar engineers.

353
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I went to Sierra Leone,

354
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --

355
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
comes across this village.

356
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"

357
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
They said, "These two grandmothers ... "

358
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.

359
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."

360
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Went straight to the president.

361
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"

362
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.

363
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
"What's the story."

364
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,820
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"

365
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.

366
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
But they will. The grandmothers will."

367
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.

368
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,820
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.

369
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Gambia:

370
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.

371
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Went to this village.

372
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
I knew which woman I would like to take.

373
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The community got together and said, "Take these two women."

374
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."

375
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."

376
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."

377
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
"Difficult husband; not possible."

378
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Called the husband, the husband came,

379
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."

380
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."

381
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."

382
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"

383
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
That was his biggest fear.

384
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."

385
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
She went like a grandmother

386
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
and came back like a tiger.

387
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
She walked out of the plane

388
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.

389
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
She handled the national press,

390
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
and she was a star.

391
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"

392
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."

393
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
(Laughter)

394
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Success story.

395
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
(Laughter)

396
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
(Applause)

397
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I'll just wind up by saying

398
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,820
that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.

399
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Look for solutions within.

400
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.

401
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
They're all over the world.

402
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Don't even worry.

403
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.

404
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
They have all the solutions in the world.

405
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.

406
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
"First they ignore you,

407
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
then they laugh at you,

408
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
then they fight you,

409
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
and then you win."

410
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Thank you.

411
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:57,820
(Applause)
