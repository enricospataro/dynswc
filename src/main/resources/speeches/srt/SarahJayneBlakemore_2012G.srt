1
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:15,397
Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed

2
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:17,447
that the vast majority of brain development

3
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,426
takes place in the first few years of life.

4
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:23,138
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability

5
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:25,759
to look inside the living human brain

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,797
and track development across the lifespan.

7
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,958
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,763
in brain imaging technology

9
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,706
such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,

10
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:39,833
neuroscientists have started to look inside the living

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,252
human brain of all ages, and to track changes

12
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:45,123
in brain structure and brain function,

13
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,800
so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,862
a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside

15
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:55,082
of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,

16
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,522
how much gray matter does the brain contain,

17
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,325
and how does that change with age?

18
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,037
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,

19
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:06,432
to take a video, a movie, of brain activity

20
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,300
when participants are taking part in some kind of task

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,192
like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,958
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind

23
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,188
of research, and we now have a really rich

24
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,712
and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,

25
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:23,780
and this picture has radically changed the way

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,413
we think about human brain development

27
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:29,181
by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,

28
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,892
and instead, the brain continues to develop

29
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,938
right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.

30
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,917
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts

31
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:44,313
with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty

32
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,598
and ends at the age at which an individual attains

33
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:51,049
a stable, independent role in society.

34
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,839
(Laughter)

35
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,604
It can go on a long time. (Laughter)

36
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:58,623
One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically

37
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,887
during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.

38
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,864
So this is a model of the human brain,

39
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:07,744
and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,253
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.

41
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,367
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than

42
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,994
in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,282
high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,

44
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:22,372
planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow

45
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:25,112
or next week or next year, inhibiting

46
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,778
inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying

47
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:30,703
something really rude or doing something really stupid.

48
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,481
It's also involved in social interaction,

49
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:35,605
understanding other people, and self-awareness.

50
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:38,655
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region

51
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:41,125
have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development

52
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,058
during the period of adolescence.

53
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:47,016
So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,

54
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:51,865
gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years

55
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,187
increases during childhood, which is what you can see

56
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:57,940
on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,505
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume

58
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,971
in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens

59
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,481
a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,

60
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,320
and that's probably because boys go through puberty

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,572
a couple of years later than girls on average,

62
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:15,007
and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline

63
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,692
in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.

64
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,717
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is

65
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:22,867
a really important developmental process, because

66
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:26,973
gray matter contains cell bodies and connections

67
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,427
between cells, the synapses, and this decline

68
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:33,172
in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex

69
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,064
is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,387
the elimination of unwanted synapses.

71
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:41,520
This is a really important process. It's partly dependent

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,654
on the environment that the animal or the human is in,

73
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:48,098
and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,

74
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,031
and synapses that aren't being used

75
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,363
in that particular environment are pruned away.

76
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,869
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.

77
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,709
You prune away the weaker branches so that

78
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,747
the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,

79
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:04,673
and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue

80
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:07,340
according to the species-specific environment,

81
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,255
is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions

82
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:13,809
during the period of human adolescence.

83
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:17,510
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes

84
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,762
in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI

85
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:24,035
to look at changes in brain activity across age.

86
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,677
So I'll just give you an example from my lab.

87
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:29,238
So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is

88
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:32,822
the network of brain regions that we use to understand

89
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:35,255
other people and to interact with other people.

90
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:39,021
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game

91
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:43,428
to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.

92
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,861
So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)

93
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,503
Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying

94
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:50,305
on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain

95
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:53,264
that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic

96
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:56,314
and instinctive social emotional responses are,

97
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:59,278
so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,

98
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,088
everyone is doing the same thing with their arms

99
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,891
and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen

100
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,715
as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing

101
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,984
with his arms, and presumably has a similar

102
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,958
facial expression, and the only people who don't

103
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,419
are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —

104
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,962
and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,

105
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,257
and they're doing another social emotional response

106
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:19,892
that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect

107
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:23,528
of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,

108
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,910
how good we are at reading other people's behavior,

109
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,587
their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,

110
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:33,403
in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.

111
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:35,180
So you don't have to ask any of these guys.

112
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,721
You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling

113
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,309
and thinking at this precise moment in time.

114
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,065
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.

115
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:45,637
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab

116
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:48,038
to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task

117
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,332
that involves thinking about other people, their minds,

118
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:54,226
their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings

119
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:57,072
that we've found several times now, as have other labs

120
00:05:57,072 --> 00:06:00,290
around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called

121
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,508
medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,

122
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:06,264
and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex

123
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,662
in the midline of your head.

124
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,945
This region is more active in adolescents when they make

125
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,072
these social decisions and think about other people

126
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,873
than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis

127
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:20,113
of nine different studies in this area from labs around

128
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,813
the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity

129
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:26,183
in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases

130
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:28,630
during the period of adolescence.

131
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,274
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults

132
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,640
use a different mental approach, a different

133
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,058
cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,

134
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,574
and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies

135
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,551
whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them

136
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,095
some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you

137
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:48,305
another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.

138
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,953
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our

139
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,678
experiments. You come into the lab,

140
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,352
you see this computerized task.

141
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:58,142
In this task, you see a set of shelves.

142
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,959
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,

143
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,930
and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set

144
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,515
of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.

145
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,794
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of

146
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:12,438
gray piece of wood.

147
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:15,922
This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.

148
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:19,415
Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,

149
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,867
whereas there are many more objects that you can see.

150
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,063
Now your task is to move objects around.

151
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,425
The director, standing behind the set of shelves,

152
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:29,170
is going to direct you to move objects around,

153
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,064
but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects

154
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:34,784
that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting

155
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:36,977
condition whereby there's a kind of conflict

156
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:40,145
between your perspective and the director's perspective.

157
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:43,385
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.

158
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,416
There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively

159
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,581
go for the white truck, because that's the top truck

160
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:50,399
from your perspective, but then you have to remember,

161
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,458
"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean

162
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,215
me to move the blue truck," which is the top truck

163
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,860
from his perspective. Now believe it or not,

164
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,811
normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors

165
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,951
about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.

166
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,794
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.

167
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:10,110
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,

168
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,664
and we also have a control condition

169
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:15,725
where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.

170
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,639
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing

171
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,476
but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to

172
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:23,683
ignore objects with the dark gray background.

173
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:26,383
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only

174
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:29,229
in the no-director condition they just have to remember

175
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,300
to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas

176
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,980
in the director condition, they have to remember

177
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,521
to take into account the director's perspective

178
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:41,818
in order to guide their ongoing behavior.

179
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:44,428
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors

180
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:46,994
in a large developmental study we did,

181
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:50,548
this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,

182
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:51,758
and what you're going to see is the percentage errors

183
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,732
in the adult group in both conditions,

184
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:57,018
so the gray is the director condition, and you see

185
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:59,591
that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent

186
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:02,306
of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors

187
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,334
when there's no director present, when they just have

188
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,415
to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.

189
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:10,083
Developmentally, these two conditions develop

190
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,006
in exactly the same way. Between late childhood

191
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,247
and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,

192
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,598
in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,

193
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:19,718
in both of these conditions.

194
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,003
But it's when you compare the last two groups,

195
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,955
the mid-adolescent group and the adult group

196
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:27,115
where things get really interesting, because there, there is

197
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:30,153
no continued improvement in the no-director condition.

198
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,083
In other words, everything you need to do in order to

199
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,789
remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed

200
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,320
by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,717
if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still

202
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:43,867
a significant improvement in the director condition

203
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,308
between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what

204
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:49,684
this means is that the ability to take into account someone

205
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:52,969
else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,

206
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,228
which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all

207
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:59,834
the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.

208
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,374
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you

209
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:04,783
sometimes think they have problems taking other people's

210
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:08,539
perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.

211
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,052
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.

212
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:15,915
They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media

213
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,442
for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,

214
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,213
they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.

215
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,706
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine

216
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:27,193
who said that the thing he noticed most

217
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,174
about his teenage daughters before and after puberty

218
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:32,418
was their level of embarrassment in front of him.

219
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,923
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters

220
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:37,177
were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,

221
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,926
stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'

222
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,827
and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing

223
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:44,298
their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.

224
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,115
(Laughter)

225
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:49,592
The very notion of their dad singing in public

226
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,955
was enough to make them behave.

227
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,383
So people often ask,

228
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:56,016
"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?

229
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:58,138
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"

230
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:00,806
And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots

231
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:04,229
of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound

232
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,386
very similar to the descriptions we use today.

233
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:10,619
So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"

234
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,394
where he describes adolescence as follows:

235
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:16,240
"I would there were no age between ten and

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,480
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;

237
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,571
for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches

238
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:27,794
with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)

239
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:32,328
He then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any

240
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:35,473
but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty

241
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:37,971
hunt in this weather?" (Laughter)

242
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,897
So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying

243
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:43,621
adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we

244
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:47,080
portray them in today, but today we try to understand

245
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,167
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes

246
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,105
that are going on in their brain.

247
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,713
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents

248
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:58,038
have a tendency to take risks. They do.

249
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,670
They take more risks than children or adults,

250
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,130
and they are particularly prone to taking risks

251
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,098
when they're with their friends. There's an important drive

252
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:08,584
to become independent from one's parents

253
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:11,408
and to impress one's friends in adolescence.

254
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,007
But now we try to understand that in terms of

255
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:17,000
the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,543
so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red

257
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:21,408
in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.

258
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,517
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,

259
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:28,250
and it's involved in things like emotion processing

260
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,400
and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling

261
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,696
out of doing fun things, including taking risks.

262
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:37,061
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.

263
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,109
And this region, the regions within the limbic system,

264
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:43,528
have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding

265
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,297
feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,

266
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:50,999
and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,

267
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,273
which you can see in blue in the slide here,

268
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,140
which stops us taking excessive risks,

269
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,538
is still very much in development in adolescents.

270
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:03,205
So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain

271
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,547
undergoes really quite profound development,

272
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:10,503
and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,

273
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:14,523
and intervention. The environment, including teaching,

274
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:17,932
can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,

275
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,734
and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been

276
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,239
routinely educating teenagers in the West.

277
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,992
All four of my grandparents, for example, left school

278
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:30,826
in their early adolescence. They had no choice.

279
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:33,600
And that's still the case for many, many teenagers

280
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,767
around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers

281
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:40,989
don't have access to secondary school education.

282
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:43,628
And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is

283
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,475
particularly adaptable and malleable.

284
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:50,245
It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.

285
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,478
So what's sometimes seen as the problem

286
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,954
with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse

287
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:58,896
control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.

288
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,733
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide

289
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,647
an excellent opportunity for education

290
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:09,077
and social development. Thank you. (Applause)

291
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:16,847
(Applause)
