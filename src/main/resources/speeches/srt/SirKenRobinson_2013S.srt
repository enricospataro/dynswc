1
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,622
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:21,326
I moved to America 12 years ago
with my wife Terry and our two kids.

3
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,136
Actually, truthfully, we moved
to Los Angeles --

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,584
(Laughter)

5
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,942
thinking we were moving
to America, but anyway --

6
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:31,901
(Laughter)

7
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:36,905
It's a short plane ride
from Los Angeles to America.

8
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,571
(Laughter)

9
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:40,855
I got here 12 years ago,

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,665
and when I got here,
I was told various things,

11
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,736
like, "Americans don't get irony."

12
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,588
(Laughter)

13
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,834
Have you come across this idea?

14
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,017
It's not true.

15
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,803
I've traveled the whole length
and breadth of this country.

16
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:59,453
I have found no evidence
that Americans don't get irony.

17
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,054
It's one of those cultural myths,

18
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:03,966
like, "The British are reserved."

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,189
(Laughter)

20
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:07,919
I don't know why people think this.

21
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,762
We've invaded every country
we've encountered.

22
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:13,070
(Laughter)

23
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,922
But it's not true Americans
don't get irony,

24
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,418
but I just want you to know
that that's what people

25
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:21,252
are saying about you behind your back.

26
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:24,212
You know, so when you leave
living rooms in Europe,

27
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:27,443
people say, thankfully,
nobody was ironic in your presence.

28
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:28,854
(Laughter)

29
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,415
But I knew that Americans get irony

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,164
when I came across that legislation,
"No Child Left Behind."

31
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,970
(Laughter)

32
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:40,595
Because whoever thought
of that title gets irony.

33
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,357
(Laughter)

34
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,839
Don't they?

35
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:49,662
(Applause)

36
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,658
Because it's leaving
millions of children behind.

37
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:56,545
Now I can see that's not a very attractive
name for legislation:

38
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,291
"Millions of Children Left Behind."

39
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,060
I can see that.

40
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,281
What's the plan?

41
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,069
We propose to leave
millions of children behind,

42
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,831
and here's how it's going to work.

43
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,241
And it's working beautifully.

44
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:08,272
(Laughter)

45
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,677
In some parts of the country,

46
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,658
60 percent of kids drop out
of high school.

47
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:15,164
In the Native American communities,

48
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:17,573
it's 80 percent of kids.

49
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,164
If we halved that number,

50
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:25,846
one estimate is it would create
a net gain to the U.S. economy

51
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,907
over 10 years,
of nearly a trillion dollars.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,653
From an economic point of view,

53
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,585
this is good math, isn't it,
that we should do this?

54
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,934
It actually costs an enormous amount

55
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,641
to mop up the damage
from the dropout crisis.

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,825
But the dropout crisis
is just the tip of an iceberg.

57
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,516
What it doesn't count
are all the kids who are in school

58
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,078
but being disengaged
from it, who don't enjoy it,

59
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,646
who don't get any real benefit from it.

60
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,410
And the reason is not
that we're not spending enough money.

61
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:01,899
America spends more money on education
than most other countries.

62
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:05,165
Class sizes are smaller
than in many countries.

63
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,763
And there are hundreds
of initiatives every year

64
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,423
to try and improve education.

65
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,415
The trouble is, it's all going
in the wrong direction.

66
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:19,160
There are three principles
on which human life flourishes,

67
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:23,171
and they are contradicted
by the culture of education

68
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,448
under which most teachers have to labor

69
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,024
and most students have to endure.

70
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:35,299
The first is this, that human beings
are naturally different and diverse.

71
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,322
Can I ask you, how many of you
have got children of your own?

72
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,655
Okay. Or grandchildren.

73
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,627
How about two children or more? Right.

74
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,561
And the rest of you
have seen such children.

75
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,321
(Laughter)

76
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,835
Small people wandering about.

77
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,581
(Laughter)

78
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,432
I will make you a bet,

79
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,504
and I am confident
that I will win the bet.

80
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,347
If you've got two children or more,

81
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,176
I bet you they are completely
different from each other.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,621
Aren't they?

83
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,547
(Applause)

84
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,150
You would never confuse them, would you?

85
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:14,214
Like, "Which one are you? Remind me."

86
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,016
(Laughter)

87
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,485
"Your mother and I need
some color-coding system

88
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,889
so we don't get confused."

89
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,791
Education under "No Child Left Behind"

90
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:28,394
is based on not diversity but conformity.

91
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,172
What schools are encouraged
to do is to find out

92
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:36,144
what kids can do across
a very narrow spectrum of achievement.

93
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,224
One of the effects
of "No Child Left Behind"

94
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:42,997
has been to narrow the focus
onto the so-called STEM disciplines.

95
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,631
They're very important.

96
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,894
I'm not here to argue
against science and math.

97
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,633
On the contrary, they're necessary
but they're not sufficient.

98
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,173
A real education has to give equal weight

99
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:56,910
to the arts, the humanities,
to physical education.

100
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:59,358
An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you --

101
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:04,484
(Applause)

102
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:08,371
One estimate in America currently
is that something like 10 percent of kids,

103
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,886
getting on that way,

104
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,976
are being diagnosed
with various conditions

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,977
under the broad title
of attention deficit disorder.

106
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:19,522
ADHD.

107
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,837
I'm not saying there's no such thing.

108
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,950
I just don't believe
it's an epidemic like this.

109
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,766
If you sit kids down, hour after hour,

110
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,745
doing low-grade clerical work,

111
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,231
don't be surprised if they start
to fidget, you know?

112
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,683
(Laughter)

113
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:41,885
(Applause)

114
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,044
Children are not, for the most part,
suffering from a psychological condition.

115
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,057
They're suffering from childhood.

116
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,175
(Laughter)

117
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,107
And I know this because
I spent my early life as a child.

118
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:57,226
I went through the whole thing.

119
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,519
Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum
that celebrates their various talents,

120
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,156
not just a small range of them.

121
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,379
And by the way, the arts
aren't just important

122
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,013
because they improve math scores.

123
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:12,154
They're important because they speak
to parts of children's being

124
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:13,607
which are otherwise untouched.

125
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,940
The second, thank you --

126
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:20,025
(Applause)

127
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:24,521
The second principle
that drives human life flourishing

128
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,029
is curiosity.

129
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:29,696
If you can light the spark
of curiosity in a child,

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,888
they will learn without any further
assistance, very often.

131
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,344
Children are natural learners.

132
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:39,660
It's a real achievement
to put that particular ability out,

133
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,061
or to stifle it.

134
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:45,688
Curiosity is the engine of achievement.

135
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,565
Now the reason I say this

136
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:51,764
is because one of the effects
of the current culture here,

137
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:52,990
if I can say so,

138
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,897
has been to De-professionalize teachers.

139
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:02,008
There is no system in the world
or any school in the country

140
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:04,296
that is better than its teachers.

141
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:09,154
Teachers are the lifeblood
of the success of schools.

142
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:12,170
But teaching is a creative profession.

143
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,521
Teaching, properly conceived,
is not a delivery system.

144
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:19,042
You know, you're not there just
to pass on received information.

145
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,294
Great teachers do that,

146
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:24,363
but what great teachers also do is mentor,

147
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:27,415
stimulate, provoke, engage.

148
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:30,050
You see, in the end,
education is about learning.

149
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,791
If there's no learning going on,
there's no education going on.

150
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,788
And people can spend an awful lot of time

151
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,385
discussing education
without ever discussing learning.

152
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,982
The whole point of education
is to get people to learn.

153
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,772
An old friend of mine --
actually very old, he's dead.

154
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:47,468
(Laughter)

155
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,969
That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.

156
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,949
(Laughter)

157
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,533
But a wonderful guy he was,
wonderful philosopher.

158
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:00,832
He used to talk about the difference

159
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,747
between the task
and achievement senses of verbs.

160
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,961
You can be engaged
in the activity of something,

161
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:10,400
but not really be
achieving it, like dieting.

162
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:11,907
(Laughter)

163
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,661
It's a very good example.

164
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,032
There he is. He's dieting.

165
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:16,925
Is he losing any weight? Not really.

166
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,541
(Laughter)

167
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,032
Teaching is a word like that.

168
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:23,244
You can say, "There's Deborah,
she's in room 34, she's teaching."

169
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:25,571
But if nobody's learning anything,

170
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:29,410
she may be engaged in the task of teaching
but not actually fulfilling it.

171
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:33,204
The role of a teacher
is to facilitate learning.

172
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,475
That's it.

173
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,375
And part of the problem is, I think,

174
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,831
that the dominant culture
of education has come to focus

175
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:42,944
on not teaching and learning, but testing.

176
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,281
Now, testing is important.

177
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,020
Standardized tests have a place.

178
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,511
But they should not be
the dominant culture of education.

179
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,631
They should be diagnostic.
They should help.

180
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:59,655
(Applause)

181
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:04,589
If I go for a medical examination,
I want some standardized tests.

182
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,183
I do.

183
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,294
I want to know
what my cholesterol level is

184
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:10,675
compared to everybody else's
on a standard scale.

185
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,941
I don't want to be told on some scale
my doctor invented in the car.

186
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,353
(Laughter)

187
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,289
"Your cholesterol
is what I call Level Orange."

188
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,496
"Really?"

189
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,297
(Laughter)

190
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,964
"Is that good?" "We don't know."

191
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,542
(Laughter)

192
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,132
But all that should support learning.

193
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:30,664
It shouldn't obstruct it,
which of course it often does.

194
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:35,182
So in place of curiosity,
what we have is a culture of compliance.

195
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:41,295
Our children and teachers are encouraged
to follow routine algorithms

196
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:45,856
rather than to excite that power
of imagination and curiosity.

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,512
And the third principle is this:
that human life is inherently creative.

198
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:52,249
It's why we all have different résumés.

199
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,890
We create our lives,

200
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,493
and we can recreate them
as we go through them.

201
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,098
It's the common currency
of being a human being.

202
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:03,265
It's why human culture
is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.

203
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:07,126
I mean, other animals may well have
imaginations and creativity,

204
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,858
but it's not so much
in evidence, is it, as ours?

205
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,386
I mean, you may have a dog.

206
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,994
And your dog may get depressed.

207
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,036
You know, but it doesn't listen
to Radiohead, does it?

208
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,815
(Laughter)

209
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,744
And sit staring out the window
with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

210
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:28,941
(Laughter)

211
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,767
"Would you like to come for a walk?"

212
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,992
"No, I'm fine."

213
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,750
(Laughter)

214
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:37,591
"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."

215
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,456
(Laughter)

216
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,229
We all create our own lives
through this restless process

217
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,349
of imagining alternatives
and possibilities,

218
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,815
and one of the roles of education

219
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,513
is to awaken and develop
these powers of creativity.

220
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:53,575
Instead, what we have
is a culture of standardization.

221
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,459
Now, it doesn't have to be that way.

222
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,068
It really doesn't.

223
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:03,137
Finland regularly comes out on top
in math, science and reading.

224
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,431
Now, we only know
that's what they do well at,

225
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,587
because that's all that's being tested.

226
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,469
That's one of the problems of the test.

227
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,231
They don't look for other things
that matter just as much.

228
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,898
The thing about work in Finland is this:

229
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,270
they don't obsess about those disciplines.

230
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,390
They have a very broad
approach to education,

231
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,784
which includes humanities,
physical education, the arts.

232
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:29,637
Second, there is no standardized
testing in Finland.

233
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,948
I mean, there's a bit,

234
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,258
but it's not what gets
people up in the morning,

235
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:35,829
what keeps them at their desks.

236
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,518
The third thing --
and I was at a meeting recently

237
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,083
with some people from Finland,
actual Finnish people,

238
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:45,979
and somebody from the American system
was saying to the people in Finland,

239
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:48,952
"What do you do
about the drop-out rate in Finland?"

240
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:52,008
And they all looked a bit
bemused, and said,

241
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:53,334
"Well, we don't have one.

242
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:55,705
Why would you drop out?

243
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,961
If people are in trouble,
we get to them quite quickly

244
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,453
and we help and support them."

245
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:02,044
Now people always say,

246
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,826
"Well, you know, you can't compare
Finland to America."

247
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:08,667
No. I think there's a population
of around five million in Finland.

248
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,005
But you can compare it
to a state in America.

249
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:16,045
Many states in America
have fewer people in them than that.

250
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,587
I mean, I've been
to some states in America

251
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,168
and I was the only person there.

252
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,995
(Laughter)

253
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,620
Really. Really.

254
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,598
I was asked to lock up when I left.

255
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,868
(Laughter)

256
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,626
But what all the high-performing
systems in the world do

257
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,514
is currently what is not evident, sadly,

258
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,779
across the systems in America --

259
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,070
I mean, as a whole.

260
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:43,832
One is this:

261
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:46,873
they individualize teaching and learning.

262
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:51,250
They recognize that it's students
who are learning

263
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,406
and the system has to engage them,

264
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,816
their curiosity, their individuality,
and their creativity.

265
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,751
That's how you get them to learn.

266
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,580
The second is that they attribute
a very high status

267
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,447
to the teaching profession.

268
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,805
They recognize
that you can't improve education

269
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,798
if you don't pick great people to teach
and keep giving them

270
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:14,019
constant support
and professional development.

271
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,015
Investing in professional
development is not a cost.

272
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,628
It's an investment,

273
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:21,397
and every other country
that's succeeding well knows that,

274
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,851
whether it's Australia, Canada,

275
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:28,302
South Korea, Singapore,
Hong Kong or Shanghai.

276
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,991
They know that to be the case.

277
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:31,381
And the third is,

278
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:35,135
they devolve responsibility
to the school level

279
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,412
for getting the job done.

280
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,168
You see, there's a big difference here

281
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:43,181
between going into a mode of command
and control in education --

282
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,933
That's what happens in some systems.

283
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,556
Central or state governments decide,

284
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,238
they know best and they're going
to tell you what to do.

285
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:54,114
The trouble is that education
doesn't go on

286
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,046
in the committee rooms
of our legislative buildings.

287
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,080
It happens in classrooms and schools,

288
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,153
and the people who do it
are the teachers and the students,

289
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,426
and if you remove their discretion,
it stops working.

290
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:09,611
You have to put it back to the people.

291
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:14,787
(Applause)

292
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,152
There is wonderful work
happening in this country.

293
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,295
But I have to say it's happening

294
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,861
in spite of the dominant
culture of education,

295
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,262
not because of it.

296
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:26,533
It's like people are sailing
into a headwind all the time.

297
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,528
And the reason I think is this:

298
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,560
that many of the current policies

299
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:35,705
are based on mechanistic
conceptions of education.

300
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:39,473
It's like education
is an industrial process

301
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:42,480
that can be improved
just by having better data,

302
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:45,420
and somewhere in the back of the mind
of some policy makers

303
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:49,554
is this idea that if we fine-tune it
well enough, if we just get it right,

304
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,839
it will all hum along perfectly
into the future.

305
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,111
It won't, and it never did.

306
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,552
The point is that education
is not a mechanical system.

307
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,375
It's a human system.

308
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,676
It's about people,

309
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,504
people who either do want
to learn or don't want to learn.

310
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:11,319
Every student who drops
out of school has a reason for it

311
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,640
which is rooted in their own biography.

312
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,242
They may find it boring.

313
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,962
They may find it irrelevant.

314
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:21,800
They may find that it's at odds with
the life they're living outside of school.

315
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:25,274
There are trends,
but the stories are always unique.

316
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,561
I was at a meeting recently
in Los Angeles of --

317
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,020
they're called alternative
education programs.

318
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,348
These are programs designed
to get kids back into education.

319
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,153
They have certain common features.

320
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,709
They're very personalized.

321
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,780
They have strong support for the teachers,

322
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:45,347
close links with the community
and a broad and diverse curriculum,

323
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:50,267
and often programs which involve students
outside school as well as inside school.

324
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,824
And they work.

325
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,167
What's interesting to me is,
these are called "alternative education."

326
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:57,239
(Laughter)

327
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:58,467
You know?

328
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,729
And all the evidence
from around the world is,

329
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,685
if we all did that, there'd be
no need for the alternative.

330
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:08,082
(Applause)

331
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:13,956
(Applause ends)

332
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,460
So I think we have to embrace
a different metaphor.

333
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:18,993
We have to recognize
that it's a human system,

334
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:22,873
and there are conditions
under which people thrive,

335
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:25,494
and conditions under which they don't.

336
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,765
We are after all organic creatures,

337
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,065
and the culture of the school
is absolutely essential.

338
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,164
Culture is an organic term, isn't it?

339
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,792
Not far from where I live
is a place called Death Valley.

340
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:45,087
Death Valley is the hottest,
driest place in America,

341
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,930
and nothing grows there.

342
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,126
Nothing grows there
because it doesn't rain.

343
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:52,100
Hence, Death Valley.

344
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:59,490
In the winter of 2004,
it rained in Death Valley.

345
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:03,021
Seven inches of rain fell
over a very short period.

346
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,525
And in the spring of 2005,
there was a phenomenon.

347
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:14,480
The whole floor of Death Valley
was carpeted in flowers for a while.

348
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,246
What it proved is this:

349
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,904
that Death Valley isn't dead.

350
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,513
It's dormant.

351
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,847
Right beneath the surface
are these seeds of possibility

352
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:30,409
waiting for the right conditions
to come about,

353
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,895
and with organic systems,
if the conditions are right,

354
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,794
life is inevitable.

355
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,481
It happens all the time.

356
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,066
You take an area, a school, a district,

357
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,494
you change the conditions, give people
a different sense of possibility,

358
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,636
a different set of expectations,
a broader range of opportunities,

359
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,946
you cherish and value the relationships
between teachers and learners,

360
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,161
you offer people
the discretion to be creative

361
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,004
and to innovate in what they do,

362
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:57,465
and schools that were once
bereft spring to life.

363
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:58,974
Great leaders know that.

364
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,583
The real role of leadership
in education --

365
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,704
and I think it's true
at the national level,

366
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,698
the state level, at the school level --

367
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:09,196
is not and should not be
command and control.

368
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,345
The real role of leadership
is climate control,

369
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,648
creating a climate of possibility.

370
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:19,102
And if you do that, people will rise to it

371
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:22,335
and achieve things
that you completely did not anticipate

372
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,302
and couldn't have expected.

373
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:26,679
There's a wonderful quote
from Benjamin Franklin.

374
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,282
"There are three sorts
of people in the world:

375
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,822
Those who are immovable,

376
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,069
people who don't get it,

377
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:34,964
or don't want to do anything about it;

378
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,700
there are people who are movable,

379
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,344
people who see the need for change

380
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,668
and are prepared to listen to it;

381
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,519
and there are people who move,

382
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,299
people who make things happen."

383
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:48,538
And if we can encourage more people,
that will be a movement.

384
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,322
And if the movement is strong enough,

385
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:54,071
that's, in the best sense
of the word, a revolution.

386
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:56,243
And that's what we need.

387
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,476
Thank you very much.

388
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,365
(Applause)

389
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,615
Thank you very much.

390
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:05,216
(Applause)
