1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Well, this is about state budgets.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
This is probably the most boring topic

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
of the whole morning.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
that we need to care about.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
State budgets

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
are big, big money --

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I'll show you the numbers --

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
and they get very little scrutiny.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
The understanding is very low.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
Many of the people involved

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
have special interests or short-term interests

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
that get them not thinking

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
about what the implications of the trends are.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
And these budgets

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
are the key for our future;

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
they're the key for our kids.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Most education funding --

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
whether it's K through 12,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
or the great universities or community colleges --

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
most of the money for those things

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
is coming out of these state budgets.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
But we have a problem.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
Here's the overall picture.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
U.S. economy is big --

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
14.7 trillion.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Now out of that pie,

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
the government spends 36 percent.

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
So this is combining the federal level,

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
which is the largest,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
the state level and the local level.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
And it's really in this combined way

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
that you get an overall sense of what's going on,

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
because there's a lot of complex things

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
like Medicaid and research money

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
that flow across those boundaries.

37
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
But we're spending 36 percent.

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Well what are we taking in?

39
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Simple business question.

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Answer is 26 percent.

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
sort of a mind-blowing number.

43
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
that we've had an economic recession.

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Receipts go down,

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
some spending programs go up,

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
but most of it is not because of that.

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Most of it is because of ways

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
that the liabilities are building up

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
and the trends,

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and that creates a huge challenge.

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
In fact, this is the forecast picture.

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
There are various things in here:

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I could say we might raise more revenue,

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,820
or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.

56
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
It is an increasingly difficult picture,

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
even assuming the economy does quite well --

58
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
probably better than it will do.

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
This is what you see

60
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
at this overall level.

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Now how did we get here?

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
How could you have a problem like this?

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
After all, at least on paper,

64
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Only one state says

66
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
they don't have to balance the budget.

67
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
But what this means actually

68
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
is that there's a pretense.

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
There's no real, true balancing going on,

70
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
and in a sense, the games they play to hide that

71
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
actually obscure the topic so much

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
that people don't see things

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,820
that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.

74
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
When Jerry Brown was elected,

75
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
this was the challenge that was put to him.

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
That is, through various gimmicks and things,

77
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
a so-called balanced budget

78
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
had led him to have 25 billion missing

79
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
out of the 76 billion in proposed spending.

80
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Now he's put together some thoughts:

81
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
About half of that he'll cut,

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
another half,

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
perhaps in a very complex set of steps,

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
taxes will be approved.

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
But even so,

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
as you go out into those future years,

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
various pension costs, health costs go up enough,

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and the revenue does not go up enough.

89
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
So you get a big squeeze.

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
What were those things that allowed us to hide this?

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
Well, some really nice little tricks.

92
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And these were somewhat noticed.

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
The paper said, "It's not really balanced.

94
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
It's got holes.

95
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
It perpetuates deficit spending.

96
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
It's riddled with gimmicks."

97
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
And really when you get down to it,

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
the guys at Enron never would have done this.

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
This is so blatant,

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
so extreme.

101
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Is anyone paying attention

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
to some of the things these guys do?

103
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
They borrow money.

104
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.

105
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
They make you pay more in withholding

106
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
just to help their cash flow out.

107
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
They sell off the assets.

108
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
They defer the payments.

109
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
They sell off the revenues from tobacco.

110
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
And California's not unique.

111
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
In fact, there's about five states that are worse

112
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
and only really four states

113
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
that don't face this big challenge.

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
So it's systemic across the entire country.

115
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
It really comes from the fact

116
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
that certain long-term obligations --

117
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,

118
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,

119
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
and just generosity --

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
that these mis-accounting things

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
allow to develop over time,

122
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
that you've got a problem.

123
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
This is the retiree health care benefits.

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --

125
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
much worse than the car companies.

126
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
And everybody looked at that

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
The forecast for the medical piece alone

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
is to go from 26 percent of the budget

130
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
to 42 percent.

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Well what's going to give?

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Well in order to accommodate that,

133
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,820
you would have to cut education spending in half.

134
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
It really is this young versus the old

135
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
to some degree.

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
If you don't change that revenue picture,

137
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
if you don't solve what you're doing in health care,

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
you're going to be deinvesting in the young.

139
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
The great University of California university system,

140
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
the great things that have gone on,

141
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
won't happen.

142
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
So far it's meant layoffs,

143
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
increased class sizes.

144
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Within the education community there's this discussion of,

145
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,

146
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
or the less good teachers who get laid off?"

147
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,

148
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
where do you do that? How much effect does that have?

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
well maybe you think that's okay.

151
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,820
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.

152
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
There's ways, if it's temporary,

153
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
to minimize the impact,

154
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
but it's a problem.

155
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
It's also really a problem for where we need to go.

156
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
Technology has a role to play.

157
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Well we need money to experiment with that,

158
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
to get those tools in there.

159
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,

160
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
measuring them, giving them feedback,

161
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
taking videos in the classroom.

162
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
That's something I think is very, very important.

163
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Well you have to allocate dollars

164
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
for that system

165
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
and for that incentive pay.

166
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
In a situation where you have growth,

167
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
you put the new money into this.

168
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.

169
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
But with the type of cuts we're talking about,

170
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
it will be far, far harder

171
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
to get these incentives for excellence,

172
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
or to move over

173
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
to use technology in the new way.

174
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
So what's going on?

175
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Where's the brain trust

176
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
that's in error here?

177
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Well there really is no brain trust.

178
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
(Laughter)

179
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.

180
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Just look at this spending.

181
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
California will spend over 100 billion,

182
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Microsoft, 38,

183
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Google, about 19.

184
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,

185
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
both inside Google and Microsoft

186
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --

187
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
should they have spent on that?

188
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --

189
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
it really is quite phenomenal.

190
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Everybody has an opinion.

191
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
There's great feedback.

192
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
And the numbers are used to make decisions.

193
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending --

194
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
particularly these long-term trends --

195
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
you don't have that type of involvement

196
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
on a number that's more important

197
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
in terms of equity, in terms of learning.

198
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
So what do we need to do?

199
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
We need better tools.

200
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
We can get some things out on the Internet.

201
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I'm going to use my website

202
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
to put up some things that will give the basic picture.

203
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
We need lots more.

204
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
There's a few good books,

205
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
one about school spending and where the money comes from --

206
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
how that's changed over time, and the challenge.

207
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
We need better accounting.

208
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
We need to take the fact

209
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
that the current employees, the future liabilities they create,

210
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
that should come out of the current budget.

211
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting

212
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
the way they have.

213
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
It should be more like private accounting.

214
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
It's the gold standard.

215
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And finally, we need to really reward politicians.

216
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems,

217
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?

218
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
We just shot you."

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
In fact, there are some like these:

220
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,

221
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
who have gone through and given proposals

222
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,820
for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.

223
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.

224
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
In fact, the week afterwards,

225
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
some tax cuts were done

226
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
that made the situation even worse

227
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
than their assumptions.

228
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So we need these pieces.

229
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Now I think this is a solvable problem.

230
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
It's a great country with lots of people.

231
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,820
But we have to draw those people in,

232
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
because this is about education.

233
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
And just look at what happened with the tuitions

234
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
with the University of California

235
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
and project that out for another three, four, five years --

236
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
it's unaffordable.

237
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
And that's the kind of thing --

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
the investment in the young --

239
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
that makes us great, allows us to contribute.

240
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
It allows us to do the art,

241
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
the biotechnology, the software

242
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
and all those magic things.

243
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
And so the bottom line is

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
we need to care about state budgets

245
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
because they're critical for our kids and our future.

246
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Thank you.

247
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
(Applause)
