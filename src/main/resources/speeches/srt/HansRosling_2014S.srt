1
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,886
Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you

2
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,211
three multiple choice questions.

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,942
Use this device. Use this device to answer.

4
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,497
The first question is, how did the number

5
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:24,618
of deaths per year

6
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:25,910
from natural disaster,

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,511
how did that change during the last century?

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,890
Did it more than double,

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,672
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,

10
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:35,046
or did it decrease to less than half?

11
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:37,450
Please answer A, B or C.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,550
I see lots of answers. This is much
faster than I do it at universities.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,707
They are so slow. They keep
thinking, thinking, thinking.

14
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,729
Oh, very, very good.

15
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,592
And we go to the next question.

16
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:51,251
So how long did women 30 years old

17
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,347
in the world go to school:

18
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,381
seven years, five years or three years?

19
00:00:55,381 --> 00:01:01,884
A, B or C? Please answer.

20
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:03,922
And we go to the next question.

21
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:07,843
In the last 20 years, how did the percentage

22
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,670
of people in the world

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,887
who live in extreme poverty change?

24
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:14,448
Extreme poverty — not having 
enough food for the day.

25
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,509
Did it almost double,

26
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,058
did it remain more or less the same,

27
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:19,571
or did it halve?

28
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:23,591
A, B or C?

29
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,747
Now, answers.

30
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:27,841
You see,

31
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,566
deaths from natural disasters in the world,

32
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,488
you can see it from this graph here,

33
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:34,268
from 1900 to 2000.

34
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:37,523
In 1900, there was about half a million people

35
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,610
who died every year from natural disasters:

36
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,707
floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruption, whatever, droughts.

37
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:47,427
And then, how did that change?

38
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:50,913
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.

39
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,772
This is how they answered.

40
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,701
The Swedish public answered like this:

41
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,173
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,

42
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,378
38 percent said it's more or less the same,

43
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,476
12 said it had halved.

44
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:03,128
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,

45
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:06,094
and it goes up and down,

46
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:08,646
and it goes to the Second World War,

47
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:12,046
and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling

48
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:13,892
and it's down to much less than half.

49
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:16,500
The world has been much, much more capable

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,114
as the decades go by

51
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:20,505
to protect people from this, you know.

52
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,371
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.

53
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,862
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.

54
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:35,708
(Laughter) (Applause)

55
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:43,077
The chimps don't watch the evening news,

56
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:44,535
so the chimps,

57
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,967
they choose by random, so the
Swedes answer worse than random.

58
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,906
Now how did you do?

59
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:53,868
That's you.

60
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,093
You were beaten by the chimps.

61
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,883
(Laughter)

62
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,858
But it was close.

63
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:04,879
You were three times better than the Swedes,

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,122
but that's not enough.

65
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,704
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.

66
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:12,235
You must have higher ambitions in the world.

67
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:15,643
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.

68
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,659
Here, you can see men went eight years.

69
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,440
How long did women go to school?

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,189
Well, we asked the Swedes like this,

71
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,406
and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?

72
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,768
The right answer is probably the one

73
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,503
the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?

74
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:31,006
(Laughter)

75
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:33,444
Let's see, let's see. Here we come.

76
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:37,845
Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.

77
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:41,258
This is the U.S. public.

78
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:45,133
And this is you. Here you come.

79
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,145
Ooh.

80
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,974
Well, congratulations, you're
twice as good as the Swedes,

81
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:53,394
but you don't need me —

82
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:58,208
So how come? I think it's like this,

83
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,930
that everyone is aware that there are countries

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,034
and there are areas

85
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,172
where girls have great difficulties.

86
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,080
They are stopped when they go to school,

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,145
and it's disgusting.

88
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,042
But in the majority of the world,

89
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,729
where most people in the world live,

90
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,711
most countries, girls today go to school

91
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,250
as long as boys, more or less.

92
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,309
That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,

93
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,393
not at all.

94
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:25,934
They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,

95
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,166
but schooling is there in the world today.

96
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,261
Now, we miss the majority.

97
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:35,584
When you answer, you answer
according to the worst places,

98
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,440
and there you are right, but you miss the majority.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,916
What about poverty?

100
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,819
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

101
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,594
was almost halved,

102
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,273
and in U.S., when we asked the public,

103
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:50,257
only five percent got it right.

104
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,126
And you?

105
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,984
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.

106
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:59,345
(Laughter) (Applause)

107
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:04,962
That little, just a few of you!

108
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:08,641
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.

109
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,435
And many in the rich countries,

110
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,095
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.

111
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,748
Of course they think so,

112
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,712
because they don't even know what has happened.

113
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:21,062
The first thing to think about the future

114
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,083
is to know about the present.

115
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,135
These questions were a few of the first ones

116
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:29,520
in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,540
in Gapminder Foundation that we run,

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,336
and it was started, this project, last year

119
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:39,742
by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)

120
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,324
He's cofounder and director,

121
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,868
and he wanted, Ola told me

122
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,428
we have to be more systematic

123
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,301
when we fight devastating ignorance.

124
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,519
So already the pilots reveal this,

125
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,729
that so many in the public score worse than random,

126
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,812
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,

127
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,840
and one of the main preconceived ideas

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,709
is about world income distribution.

129
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,540
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.

130
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,759
It's the number of people on each income,

131
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,650
from one dollar a day —

132
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,101
(Applause)

133
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,176
See, there was one hump here,

134
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,074
around one dollar a day,

135
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,530
and then there was one hump here

136
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,545
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.

137
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,291
The world was two groups.

138
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,901
It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,

139
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,913
the poor ones and the rich ones,

140
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,477
and there were fewer in between.

141
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,646
But look how this has changed:

142
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,472
As I go forward, what has changed,

143
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,128
the world population has grown,

144
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,896
and the humps start to merge.

145
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,666
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,

146
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,793
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world

147
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:44,048
with one hump only.

148
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:45,972
The percent in poverty has decreased.

149
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,549
Still it's appalling

150
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:50,750
that so many remain in extreme poverty.

151
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,773
We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,

152
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:56,822
but that can be ended now.

153
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,125
The challenge we have now

154
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,933
is to get away from that,
understand where the majority is,

155
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,177
and that is very clearly shown in this question.

156
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,410
We asked, what is the percentage of the world's

157
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,064
one-year-old children who have got those

158
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,674
basic vaccines against measles and other things

159
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,167
that we have had for many years:

160
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,189
20, 50 or 80 percent?

161
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,262
Now, this is what the U.S.
public and the Swedish answered.

162
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,138
Look at the Swedish result:

163
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,200
you know what the right answer is.

164
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,873
(Laughter)

165
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:29,376
Who the heck is a professor of
global health in that country?

166
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,048
Well, it's me. It's me.

167
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,010
(Laughter)

168
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,492
It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.

169
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:38,590
(Applause)

170
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,304
However, Ola's approach

171
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:45,462
to really measure what we know made headlines,

172
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:48,525
and CNN published these results on their web

173
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,672
and they had the questions there, millions answered,

174
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:54,154
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,

175
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,467
and this was one of the comments.

176
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:00,011
"I bet no member of the media
passed the test," he said.

177
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,650
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.

178
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,355
You are invited to media conferences.

179
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:06,632
Give it to them and measure what the media know."

180
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,556
And ladies and gentlemen,

181
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,233
for the first time, the informal results

182
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:15,158
from a conference with U.S. media.

183
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:20,044
And then, lately, from the European Union media.

184
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:21,312
(Laughter)

185
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,517
You see, the problem is not that people

186
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,465
don't read and listen to the media.

187
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:29,684
The problem is that the
media doesn't know themselves.

188
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,265
What shall we do about this, Ola?

189
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,763
Do we have any ideas?

190
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:43,857
(Applause)

191
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,566
Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,

192
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:51,381
I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.

193
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,014
Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you

194
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:58,573
by showing why it was not your fault, actually.

195
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,595
Then, I will equip you with some tricks

196
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,685
for beating the chimps in the future.

197
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,899
That's basically what I will do.

198
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,102
But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,

199
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:09,709
and it all starts in this place.

200
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,399
It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.

201
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,196
It's a neighborhood where I grew up,

202
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:20,797
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.

203
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,783
Actually, it has exactly the same problem

204
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:25,392
which existed in all the neighborhoods

205
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:26,740
where you grew up as well.

206
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,402
It was not representative. Okay?

207
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,845
It gave me a very biased view

208
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:34,193
of how life is on this planet.

209
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:37,185
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.

210
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,457
We have a personal bias.

211
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,570
We have all different experiences

212
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,210
from communities and people we meet,

213
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,197
and on top of this, we start school,

214
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,118
and we add the next problem.

215
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,262
Well, I like schools,

216
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:53,349
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,

217
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,950
because they learned something
when they went to school,

218
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,503
and now they describe this world to the students

219
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,709
without any bad intentions,

220
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,938
and those books, of course, that are printed

221
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,869
are outdated in a world that changes.

222
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,116
And there is really no practice

223
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:10,365
to keep the teaching material up to date.

224
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,349
So that's what we are focusing on.

225
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,918
So we have these outdated facts

226
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,852
added on top of our personal bias.

227
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:19,328
What happens next is news, okay?

228
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,845
An excellent journalist knows how to pick

229
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,251
the story that will make headlines,

230
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,850
and people will read it because it's sensational.

231
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,815
Unusual events are more interesting, no?

232
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,530
And they are exaggerated,

233
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,959
and especially things we're afraid of.

234
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,387
A shark attack on a Swedish person

235
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,102
will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.

236
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:45,821
So these three skewed sources of information

237
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:49,096
were really hard to get away from.

238
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,727
They kind of bombard us

239
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:54,533
and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,

240
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,270
and on top of it we put the very thing

241
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,536
that makes us humans, our human intuition.

242
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,712
It was good in evolution.

243
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:05,970
It helped us generalize

244
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,228
and jump to conclusions very, very fast.

245
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:12,196
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,

246
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:15,480
and we seek causality where there is none,

247
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,417
and we then get an illusion of confidence

248
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,423
where we believe that we are the best car drivers,

249
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,163
above the average.

250
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:26,525
Everybody answered that question,

251
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:27,794
"Yeah, I drive cars better."

252
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:30,091
Okay, this was good evolutionarily,

253
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,924
but now when it comes to the worldview,

254
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,786
it is the exact reason why it's upside down.

255
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:37,709
The trends that are increasing are instead falling,

256
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,291
and the other way around,

257
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,291
and in this case, the chimps
use our intuition against us,

258
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,731
and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.

259
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,214
It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?

260
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,586
So how do we solve such problems?

261
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,261
First, we need to measure it,

262
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,663
and then we need to cure it.

263
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:57,195
So by measuring it we can understand

264
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,519
what is the pattern of ignorance.

265
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,055
We started the pilot last year,

266
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,524
and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter

267
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:07,105
a lot of ignorance across the whole world,

268
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:10,718
and the idea is really to

269
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,695
scale it up to all domains

270
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,243
or dimensions of global development,

271
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:19,325
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,

272
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,535
gender equality, energy, finance.

273
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,268
All different sectors have facts,

274
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:26,864
and there are organizations trying to spread

275
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,790
awareness about these facts.

276
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,494
So I've started actually contacting some of them,

277
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:35,835
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,

278
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,433
and asking them, what are your favorite facts

279
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,326
which you think the public doesn't know?

280
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,904
Okay, I gather those facts.

281
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:45,439
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.

282
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,738
And then we poll the public

283
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,675
and see where they score worst.

284
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,021
So we get a shorter list

285
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,077
with the terrible results,

286
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,626
like some few examples from Hans,

287
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,543
and we have no problem finding these kinds

288
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:56,758
of terrible results.

289
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,603
Okay, this little shortlist, what
are we going to do with it?

290
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:03,729
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,

291
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,591
a global knowledge certificate,

292
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:08,494
which you can use, if you're a large organization,

293
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:12,249
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,

294
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,877
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.

295
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:18,840
Basically meaning, we don't hire people

296
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,110
who score like chimpanzees.

297
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,470
Of course you shouldn't.

298
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,741
So maybe 10 years from now,

299
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,733
if this project succeeds,

300
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,981
you will be sitting in an interview

301
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:34,187
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.

302
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:37,550
So now we come to the practical tricks.

303
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,454
How are you going to succeed?

304
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:43,033
There is, of course, one way,

305
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,770
which is to sit down late nights

306
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,925
and learn all the facts by heart

307
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,693
by reading all these reports.

308
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,705
That will never happen, actually.

309
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,414
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.

310
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:54,787
People don't have that time.

311
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:58,170
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.

312
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,944
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.

313
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:02,388
We need to be able to generalize.

314
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:04,493
So now I'm going to show you some tricks

315
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,043
where the misconceptions are turned around

316
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:10,251
into rules of thumb.

317
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,265
Let's start with the first misconception.

318
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,902
This is very widespread.

319
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:15,768
Everything is getting worse.

320
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:19,038
You heard it. You thought it yourself.

321
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,067
The other way to think is, most things improve.

322
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,203
So you're sitting with a question in front of you

323
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:27,436
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."

324
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:30,420
Okay? Don't go for the worse.

325
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,783
That will help you score better on our tests.

326
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,999
(Applause)

327
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,225
That was the first one.

328
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,984
There are rich and poor

329
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,450
and the gap is increasing.

330
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,105
It's a terrible inequality.

331
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:45,306
Yeah, it's an unequal world,

332
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,631
but when you look at the data, it's one hump.

333
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,485
Okay? If you feel unsure,

334
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,238
go for "the most people are in the middle."

335
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:54,221
That's going to help you get the answer right.

336
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:57,928
Now, the next preconceived idea is

337
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:01,553
first countries and people need to be very, very rich

338
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:03,879
to get the social development

339
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,330
like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.

340
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,016
No, no, no. That's wrong.

341
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,136
Look: that huge hump in the middle

342
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:13,579
already have girls in school.

343
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,907
So if you are unsure, go for the

344
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:17,302
"the majority already have this,"

345
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:20,345
like electricity and girls in
school, these kinds of things.

346
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,561
They're only rules of thumb,

347
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,951
so of course they don't apply to everything,

348
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,608
but this is how you can generalize.

349
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,573
Let's look at the last one.

350
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,874
If something, yes, this is a good one,

351
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,047
sharks are dangerous.

352
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:38,446
No — well, yes, but they are not so important

353
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:41,422
in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.

354
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,953
I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.

355
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:46,797
So as soon as I see a question
about things I'm afraid of,

356
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:49,730
which might be earthquakes, other religions,

357
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,768
maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,

358
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:53,927
anything that makes me feel,

359
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,428
assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.

360
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,265
That's a rule of thumb.

361
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,424
Of course there are dangerous 
things that are also great.

362
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:04,009
Sharks kill very, very few.
That's how you should think.

363
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,747
With these four rules of thumb,

364
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:11,107
you could probably answer better than the chimps,

365
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,061
because the chimps cannot do this.

366
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:15,664
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.

367
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:19,676
And hopefully we can turn your world around

368
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:22,511
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?

369
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:26,432
(Applause)

370
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,068
That's a systematic approach.

371
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:35,632
Now the question, is this important?

372
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,358
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,

373
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:41,605
extreme poverty and how to fight it,

374
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,650
and how to bring girls in school.

375
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,990
When we realize that actually it's
succeeding, we can understand it.

376
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,802
But is it important for everyone else

377
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,256
who cares about the rich end of this scale?

378
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:54,300
I would say yes, extremely important,

379
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,809
for the same reason.

380
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:58,874
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,

381
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,492
you might have a chance to understand

382
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,246
what's coming next in the future.

383
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,684
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.

384
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,034
That's when I was born,

385
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:09,053
and I selected the West.

386
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:13,236
That's the current EU countries and North America.

387
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:16,619
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares

388
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,700
in terms of how rich you are.

389
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,951
These are the people who can afford

390
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,529
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.

391
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,837
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived

392
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,804
outside EU and North America.

393
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:33,133
But this has changed, okay?

394
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:37,876
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.

395
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,264
Today it's 50/50.

396
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:42,945
The Western domination is over, as of today.

397
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,144
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?

398
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:48,387
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?

399
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:54,418
I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,
International Monetary Fund, website.

400
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:58,581
They have a forecast for the next 
five years of GDP per capita.

401
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:01,598
So I can use that to go five years into the future,

402
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,933
assuming the income inequality 
of each country is the same.

403
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,860
I did that, but I went even further.

404
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,038
I used those five years for the next 20 years

405
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,315
with the same speed, just as an 
experiment what might actually happen.

406
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,682
Let's move into the future.

407
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:21,902
In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.

408
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:24,938
In 2025, 63 percent.

409
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:34,175
2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is 
outnumbered in the rich consumer market.

410
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:37,522
These are just projections of 
GDP per capita into the future.

411
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:39,877
Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers

412
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:43,495
are going to live outside North America and Europe.

413
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:47,693
So yes, I think it's a good idea for 
a company to use this certificate

414
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,100
to make sure to make fact-
based decisions in the future.

415
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,576
Thank you very much.

416
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:55,077
(Applause)
