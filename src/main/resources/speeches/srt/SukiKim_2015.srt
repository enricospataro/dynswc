1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:18,039
In 2011, during the final six months
of Kim Jong-Il's life,

2
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,019
I lived undercover in North Korea.

3
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,079
I was born and raised
in South Korea, their enemy.

4
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,571
I live in America, their other enemy.

5
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,887
Since 2002, I had visited
North Korea a few times.

6
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:41,605
And I had come to realize
that to write about it with any meaning,

7
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,437
or to understand the place
beyond the regime's propaganda,

8
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:51,172
the only option was total immersion.

9
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,180
So I posed as a teacher and a missionary

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,968
at an all-male university in Pyongyang.

11
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:09,821
The Pyongyang University
of Science and Technology

12
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:15,754
was founded by Evangelical Christians
who cooperate with the regime

13
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:20,248
to educate the sons
of the North Korean elite,

14
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:24,920
without proselytizing,
which is a capital crime there.

15
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:33,717
The students were 270 young men,
expected to be the future leaders

16
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:38,784
of the most isolated and brutal
dictatorship in existence.

17
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,771
When I arrived, they became my students.

18
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,438
2011 was a special year,

19
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:55,703
marking the 100th anniversary of the birth
of North Korea's original Great Leader,

20
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,186
Kim Il-Sung.

21
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,181
To celebrate the occasion, the regime
shut down all universities,

22
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:06,015
and sent students off to the fields

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,173
to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal

24
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,839
as the world's most powerful
and prosperous nation.

25
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:19,675
My students were the only ones
spared from that fate.

26
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:24,985
North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.

27
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,290
Everything there
is about the Great Leader.

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:33,624
Every book, every newspaper article,
every song, every TV program --

29
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:35,300
there is just one subject.

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,731
The flowers are named after him,

31
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:40,627
the mountains are carved with his slogans.

32
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:45,008
Every citizen wears the badge
of the Great Leader at all times.

33
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:49,863
Even their calendar system begins
with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.

34
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:56,079
The school was a heavily guarded
prison, posing as a campus.

35
00:02:56,571 --> 00:03:02,193
Teachers could only leave on group outings
accompanied by an official minder.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,153
Even then, our trips were limited
to sanctioned national monuments

37
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,984
celebrating the Great Leader.

38
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,070
The students were not allowed
to leave the campus,

39
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,732
or communicate with their parents.

40
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:24,706
Their days were meticulously mapped out,
and any free time they had

41
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,122
was devoted to honoring
their Great Leader.

42
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:34,248
Lesson plans had to meet the approval
of North Korean staff,

43
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,477
every class was recorded and reported on,
every room was bugged,

44
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,199
and every conversation, overheard.

45
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:48,233
Every blank space was covered with the 
portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,

46
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,868
like everywhere else in North Korea.

47
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:55,765
We were never allowed
to discuss the outside world.

48
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,799
As students of science and technology,
many of them were computer majors

49
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,432
but they did not know
the existence of the Internet.

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,233
They had never heard
of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

51
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:13,353
Facebook, Twitter -- none of those things
would have meant a thing.

52
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,868
And I could not tell them.

53
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:21,031
I went there looking for truth.

54
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:25,601
But where do you even start
when an entire nation's ideology,

55
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,618
my students' day-to-day realities,

56
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,594
and even my own position
at the universities,

57
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:34,469
were all built on lies?

58
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,900
I started with a game.

59
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,402
We played "Truth and Lie."

60
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,152
A volunteer would write a sentence
on the chalkboard,

61
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,927
and the other students had to guess

62
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,954
whether it was a truth or a lie.

63
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:55,181
Once a student wrote, "I visited
China last year on vacation,"

64
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:57,813
and everyone shouted, "Lie!"

65
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,113
They all knew this wasn't possible.

66
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:05,093
Virtually no North Korean is allowed
to leave the country.

67
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:09,438
Even traveling within their own country
requires a travel pass.

68
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,666
I had hoped that this game would reveal
some truth about my students,

69
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,753
because they lie so often and so easily,

70
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:25,190
whether about the mythical
accomplishments of their Great Leader,

71
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:29,252
or the strange claim that they cloned
a rabbit as fifth graders.

72
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:36,219
The difference between truth and lies
seemed at times hazy to them.

73
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:40,334
It took me a while to understand
the different types of lies;

74
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,334
they lie to shield their system
from the world,

75
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:47,213
or they were taught lies,
and were just regurgitating them.

76
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:49,855
Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.

77
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:56,245
But if all they have ever known were lies,

78
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,769
how could we expect them to be otherwise?

79
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,709
Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.

80
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:06,469
But that turned out to be
nearly impossible.

81
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:10,864
Essays are about coming up with
one's own thesis,

82
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:14,793
and making an evidence-based
argument to prove it.

83
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:19,781
These students, however, were
simply told what to think,

84
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:20,955
and they obeyed.

85
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,983
In their world, critical thinking
was not allowed.

86
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,331
I also gave them the weekly assignment
of writing a personal letter,

87
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,505
to anybody.

88
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,304
It took a long time, but eventually
some of them began to write

89
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:41,003
to their mothers, their friends,
their girlfriends.

90
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:45,291
Although those were just homework,

91
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:48,871
and would never reach
their intended recipients,

92
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,965
my students slowly began to reveal
their true feelings in them.

93
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:58,342
They wrote that they were fed
up with the sameness of everything.

94
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:01,199
They were worried about their future.

95
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:06,531
In those letters, they rarely ever
mentioned their Great Leader.

96
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:13,642
I was spending all of my time
with these young men.

97
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:18,864
We all ate meals together,
played basketball together.

98
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,904
I often called them gentlemen,
which made them giggle.

99
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,641
They blushed at the mention of girls.

100
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,120
And I came to adore them.

101
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:34,160
And watching them open up
even in the tiniest of ways,

102
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,254
was deeply moving.

103
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,701
But something also felt wrong.

104
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,642
During those months
of living in their world,

105
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,485
I often wondered if the truth would,
in fact, improve their lives.

106
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,670
I wanted so much to tell them the truth,

107
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:58,114
of their country and of the outside world,

108
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:02,129
where Arab youth were turning
their rotten regime inside out,

109
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:03,948
using the power of social media,

110
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:08,670
where everyone except them was
connected through the world wide web,

111
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,535
which wasn't worldwide after all.

112
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,820
But for them, the truth was dangerous.

113
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:23,674
By encouraging them to run after it,
I was putting them at risk --

114
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:26,055
of persecution,

115
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,430
of heartbreak.

116
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,233
When you're not allowed to express
anything in the open,

117
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:36,138
you become good at reading
what is unspoken.

118
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:42,580
In one of their personal letters to me,
a student wrote that he understood

119
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,446
why I always called them gentlemen.

120
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,253
It was because I was wishing them
to be gentle in life, he said.

121
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:57,364
On my last day in December of 2011,

122
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,138
the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,

123
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,810
their world shattered.

124
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,200
I had to leave without a proper goodbye.

125
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:11,025
But I think they knew
how sad I was for them.

126
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,065
Once, toward the end of my stay,
a student said to me,

127
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,563
"Professor, we never think of you
as being different from us.

128
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:27,694
Our circumstances are different,
but you're the same as us.

129
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:31,836
We want you to know that we truly
think of you as being the same."

130
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:41,626
Today, if I could respond
to my students with a letter of my own,

131
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,126
which is of course impossible,

132
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,749
I would tell them this:

133
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:52,345
"My dear gentlemen,

134
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,344
It's been a bit over three years
since I last saw you.

135
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:59,615
And now, you must be 22 --
maybe even as old as 23.

136
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,985
At our final class, I asked you
if there was anything you wanted.

137
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:09,061
The only wish you expressed,
the only thing you ever asked of me

138
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:12,503
in all those months we spent together,

139
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,453
was for me to speak to you in Korean.

140
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,130
Just once.

141
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:19,380
I was there to teach you English;

142
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:20,921
you knew it wasn't allowed.

143
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:27,695
But I understood then, you wanted
to share that bond of our mother tongue.

144
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:33,102
I called you my gentlemen,

145
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:37,547
but I don't know if being gentle
in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea

146
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,753
is a good thing.

147
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,864
I don't want you to lead a revolution --

148
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,892
let some other young person do it.

149
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:48,401
The rest of the world might casually
encourage or even expect

150
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,775
some sort of North Korean Spring,

151
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,321
but I don't want you to do anything risky,

152
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:57,189
because I know in your world,
someone is always watching.

153
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,331
I don't want to imagine
what might happen to you.

154
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:06,987
If my attempts to reach you have
inspired something new in you,

155
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,561
I would rather you forget me.

156
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:13,805
Become soldiers of your Great Leader,
and live long, safe lives.

157
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:20,880
You once asked me if I thought
your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,

158
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:23,596
and I could not answer truthfully then.

159
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:26,810
But I know why you asked.

160
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:31,844
I know that it was important for you
to hear that I, your teacher,

161
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,729
the one who has seen the world
that you are forbidden from,

162
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:39,080
declare your city as the most beautiful.

163
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:46,768
I know hearing that would make
your lives there a bit more bearable,

164
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:50,159
but no, I don't find
your capital beautiful.

165
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,349
Not because it's monotone and concrete,

166
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,236
but because of what it symbolizes:

167
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,093
a monster that feeds off
the rest of the country,

168
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,990
where citizens are soldiers and slaves.

169
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:07,162
All I see there is darkness.

170
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,200
But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.

171
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:18,480
And I hope instead that you,
my lovely young gentlemen,

00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,998
will one day help make it beautiful.

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,978
Thank you.
