1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
The world is changing

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
with really remarkable speed.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
If you look at the chart at the top here,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
you'll see that in 2025,

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
these Goldman Sachs projections

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
suggest that the Chinese economy

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
will be almost the same size as the American economy.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
And if you look at the chart

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
for 2050,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
it's projected that the Chinese economy

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
will be twice the size of the American economy,

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
and the Indian economy will be almost the same size

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
as the American economy.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
And we should bear in mind here

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that these projections were drawn up

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
before the Western financial crisis.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
A couple of weeks ago,

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I was looking at the latest projection

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
by BNP Paribas

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
for when China

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
will have a larger economy

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
than the United States.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Goldman Sachs projected 2027.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
The post-crisis projection

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
is 2020.

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
That's just a decade away.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,820
China is going to change the world

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
in two fundamental respects.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
First of all,

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
it's a huge developing country

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,820
with a population of 1.3 billion people,

32
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
which has been growing for over 30 years

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
at around 10 percent a year.

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
And within a decade,

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,820
it will have the largest economy in the world.

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Never before in the modern era

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
has the largest economy in the world

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
been that of a developing country,

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
rather than a developed country.

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Secondly,

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
for the first time in the modern era,

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
the dominant country in the world --

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
which I think is what China will become --

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
will be not from the West

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,820
and from very, very different civilizational roots.

46
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
that as countries modernize,

48
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
they also westernize.

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
This is an illusion.

50
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
It's an assumption that modernity

51
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.

52
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
It is not. It is also shaped equally

53
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
by history and culture.

54
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
China is not like the West,

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
and it will not become like the West.

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
It will remain in very fundamental respects

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
very different.

58
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
Now the big question here is obviously,

59
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
how do we make sense of China?

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
How do we try to understand what China is?

61
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
is that the conventional approach

63
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
is that we understand it really in Western terms,

64
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
using Western ideas.

65
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
We can't.

66
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Now I want to offer you

67
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
three building blocks

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
for trying to understand what China is like,

69
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
just as a beginning.

70
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
The first is this:

71
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
that China is not really a nation-state.

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state

73
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
for the last hundred years,

74
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
but everyone who knows anything about China

75
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
knows it's a lot older than this.

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty

77
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,820
in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --

78
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
the birth of modern China.

79
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,

81
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
still 2,000 years ago.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And you can see already it occupies

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
most of what we now know as Eastern China,

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then

85
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
and live now.

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
Now what is extraordinary about this

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
is, what gives China its sense of being China,

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
what gives the Chinese

89
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
the sense of what it is to be Chinese,

90
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
comes not from the last hundred years,

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
not from the nation-state period,

92
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
which is what happened in the West,

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
but from the period, if you like,

94
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
of the civilization-state.

95
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
I'm thinking here, for example,

96
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
of customs like ancestral worship,

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
of a very distinctive notion of the state,

98
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
social relationships like guanxi,

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Confucian values and so on.

101
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
These are all things that come

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
from the period of the civilization-state.

103
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is shaped by its sense of civilization,

105
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
its existence as a civilization-state,

106
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
rather than as a nation-state.

107
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:

108
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
Of course we know China's big, huge,

109
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
demographically and geographically,

110
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
with a population of 1.3 billion people.

111
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
What we often aren't really aware of

112
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
is the fact

113
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
that China is extremely diverse

114
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
and very pluralistic,

115
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
and in many ways very decentralized.

116
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,

117
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
even though we think this to be the case.

118
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
It's never been the case.

119
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
So this is China, a civilization-state,

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
rather than a nation-state.

121
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
And what does it mean?

122
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.

123
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
I'll give you two quick ones.

124
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
The first is that

125
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,820
the most important political value for the Chinese

126
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
is unity,

127
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
is the maintenance

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
of Chinese civilization.

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:

130
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.

132
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
China, over the same time period,

133
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
went in exactly the opposite direction,

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
very painfully holding this huge civilization,

135
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
civilization-state, together.

136
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
The second

137
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
is maybe more prosaic,

138
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
which is Hong Kong.

139
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong

140
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
by Britain to China in 1997?

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
You may remember

142
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.

143
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
One country, two systems.

144
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
And I'll lay a wager

145
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
that barely anyone in the West believed them.

146
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
"Window dressing.

147
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,

148
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
that won't be the case."

149
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Thirteen years on,

150
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
the political and legal system in Hong Kong

151
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
is as different now as it was in 1997.

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?

153
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,

154
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
in nation-state ways.

155
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Think of German unification, 1990.

156
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
What happened?

157
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
One nation, one system.

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
That is the nation-state mentality.

160
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
But you can't run a country like China,

161
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
a civilization-state,

162
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
on the basis of one civilization, one system.

163
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
It doesn't work.

164
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
So actually the response of China

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
to the question of Hong Kong --

166
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
as it will be to the question of Taiwan --

167
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
was a natural response:

168
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
one civilization, many systems.

169
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Let me offer you another building block

170
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
to try and understand China --

171
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
maybe not sort of a comfortable one.

172
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
The Chinese have a very, very different

173
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
conception of race

174
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
to most other countries.

175
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Do you know,

176
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
of the 1.3 billion Chinese,

177
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
over 90 percent of them

178
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
think they belong to the same race,

179
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
the Han?

180
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Now, this is completely different

181
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
from the world's [other] most populous countries.

182
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
India, the United States,

183
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Indonesia, Brazil --

184
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
all of them are multiracial.

185
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
The Chinese don't feel like that.

186
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
China is only multiracial

187
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
really at the margins.

188
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
So the question is, why?

189
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Well the reason, I think, essentially

190
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
is, again, back to the civilization-state.

191
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
A history of at least 2,000 years,

192
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
a history of conquest, occupation,

193
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
absorption, assimilation and so on,

194
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
led to the process by which,

195
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
over time, this notion of the Han emerged --

196
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
of course, nurtured

197
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
by a growing and very powerful sense

198
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
of cultural identity.

199
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Now the great advantage of this historical experience

200
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,820
has been that, without the Han,

201
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
China could never have held together.

202
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
The Han identity has been the cement

203
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
which has held this country together.

204
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
The great disadvantage of it

205
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
is that the Han have a very weak conception

206
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
of cultural difference.

207
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
They really believe

208
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
in their own superiority,

209
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
and they are disrespectful

210
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
of those who are not.

211
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Hence their attitude, for example,

212
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.

213
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Or let me give you my third building block,

214
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
the Chinese state.

215
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Now the relationship

216
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
between the state and society in China

217
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
is very different from that in the West.

218
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Now we in the West

219
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --

220
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
that the authority and legitimacy of the state

221
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
is a function of democracy.

222
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
The problem with this proposition

223
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,820
is that the Chinese state

224
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
enjoys more legitimacy

225
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
and more authority

226
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
amongst the Chinese

227
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
than is true

228
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
with any Western state.

229
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
And the reason for this

230
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
is because --

231
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
well, there are two reasons, I think.

232
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,

233
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.

234
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
And the reason for this is,

235
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
firstly, because the state in China

236
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
is given a very special --

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
it enjoys a very special significance

238
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
as the representative,

239
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
the embodiment and the guardian

240
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
of Chinese civilization,

241
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
of the civilization-state.

242
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
This is as close as China gets

243
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
to a kind of spiritual role.

244
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
And the second reason is because,

245
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
whereas in Europe

246
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
and North America,

247
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
the state's power is continuously challenged --

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I mean in the European tradition,

249
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
historically against the church,

250
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
against other sectors of the aristocracy,

251
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
against merchants and so on --

252
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
for 1,000 years,

253
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
the power of the Chinese state

254
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
has not been challenged.

255
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
It's had no serious rivals.

256
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
So you can see

257
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,820
that the way in which power has been constructed in China

258
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
is very different from our experience

259
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
in Western history.

260
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
The result, by the way,

261
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,820
is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.

262
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder,

263
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
a stranger,

264
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
certainly an organ

265
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
whose powers need to be limited

266
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
or defined and constrained,

267
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.

268
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
The Chinese view the state

269
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,

270
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
as a member of the family --

271
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
not just in fact as a member of the family,

272
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
but as the head of the family,

273
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
the patriarch of the family.

274
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
This is the Chinese view of the state --

275
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
very, very different to ours.

276
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
It's embedded in society in a different kind of way

277
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
to what is the case

278
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
in the West.

279
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,

280
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
in the Chinese context,

281
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
is a new kind of paradigm,

282
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
which is different from anything

283
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
we've had to think about in the past.

284
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Know that China believes in the market and the state.

285
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
I mean, Adam Smith,

286
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
already writing in the late 18th century, said,

287
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
"The Chinese market is larger and more developed

288
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
and more sophisticated

289
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
than anything in Europe."

290
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
And, apart from the Mao period,

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
that has remained more or less the case ever since.

292
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
But this is combined

293
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,820
with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.

294
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
The state is everywhere in China.

295
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
I mean, it's leading firms --

296
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
many of them are still publicly owned.

297
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,

298
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
depend in many ways on state patronage.

299
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Targets for the economy and so on

300
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
are set by the state.

301
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --

302
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
as we are familiar with --

303
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
with something like the one-child policy.

304
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,

305
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
a very old tradition of statecraft.

306
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
I mean, if you want an illustration of this,

307
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
the Great Wall is one.

308
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
But this is another, this is the Grand Canal,

309
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
which was constructed in the first instance

310
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
in the fifth century B.C.

311
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
and was finally completed

312
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
in the seventh century A.D.

313
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
It went for 1,114 miles,

314
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
linking Beijing

315
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
with Hangzhou and Shanghai.

316
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
So there's a long history

317
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
of extraordinary state infrastructural projects

318
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
in China,

319
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,

320
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
which is something like the Three Gorges Dam

321
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
and many other expressions

322
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
of state competence

323
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
within China.

324
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
So there we have three building blocks

325
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
for trying to understand the difference that is China --

326
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
the civilization-state,

327
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
the notion of race

328
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
and the nature of the state

329
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
and its relationship to society.

330
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
And yet we still insist, by and large,

331
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,820
in thinking that we can understand China

332
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
by simply drawing on Western experience,

333
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
looking at it through Western eyes,

334
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
using Western concepts.

335
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
If you want to know why

336
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
we unerringly seem to get China wrong --

337
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --

338
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,820
this is the reason.

339
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Unfortunately, I think,

340
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
I have to say that I think

341
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
attitude towards China

342
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.

343
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
It's kind of arrogant.

344
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
It's arrogant in the sense

345
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
that we think that we are best,

346
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and therefore we have the universal measure.

347
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
And secondly, it's ignorant.

348
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
We refuse to really address

349
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
the issue of difference.

350
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
You know, there's a very interesting passage

351
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.

352
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
And Paul Cohen argues

353
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,820
that the West thinks of itself

354
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
as probably the most cosmopolitan

355
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
of all cultures.

356
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
But it's not.

357
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
In many ways,

358
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
it's the most parochial,

359
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
because for 200 years,

360
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
the West has been so dominant in the world

361
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
that it's not really needed

362
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
to understand other cultures,

363
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
other civilizations.

364
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Because, at the end of the day,

365
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
it could, if necessary by force,

366
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
get its own way.

367
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Whereas those cultures --

368
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
virtually the rest of the world, in fact,

369
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --

370
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
have been thereby forced to understand the West,

371
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
because of the West's presence in those societies.

372
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
And therefore, they are, as a result,

373
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.

374
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I mean, take the question of East Asia.

375
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --

376
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
a third of the world's population lives there.

377
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Now the largest economic region in the world.

378
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
And I'll tell you now,

379
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
that East Asianers, people from East Asia,

380
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
are far more knowledgeable

381
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
about the West

382
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,820
than the West is about East Asia.

383
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,

384
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
to the present.

385
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,

386
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
the Goldman Sachs chart.

387
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
What is happening

388
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
is that, very rapidly in historical terms,

389
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
the world is being driven

390
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
and shaped,

391
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
not by the old developed countries,

392
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
but by the developing world.

393
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
We've seen this

394
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
in terms of the G20

395
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
usurping very rapidly the position of the G7,

396
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
or the G8.

397
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
And there are two consequences of this.

398
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
First, the West

399
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
is rapidly losing

400
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
its influence in the world.

401
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --

402
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Copenhagen, climate change conference.

403
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Europe was not at the final negotiating table.

404
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
When did that last happen?

405
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.

406
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
And that is what is going to happen in the future.

407
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
And the second implication

408
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,

409
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
become increasingly unfamiliar to us,

410
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories

411
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
that we are not really familiar with,

412
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
or conversant with.

413
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;

414
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
America is slightly different --

415
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
but Europeans by and large, I have to say,

416
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
are ignorant,

417
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
are unaware

418
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
about the way the world is changing.

419
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Some people -- I've got an English friend in China,

420
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."

421
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Well, maybe that's true,

422
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
maybe that's an exaggeration.

423
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,820
But there's another problem which goes along with this --

424
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --

425
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
and that is a sort of

426
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
loss of a sense of the future.

427
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future

428
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
in its confidence.

429
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Take the 19th century, for example.

430
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820
But this, alas, is no longer true.

431
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,

432
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
try China -- there's old Confucius.

433
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
This is a railway station

434
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
the likes of which you've never seen before.

435
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
It doesn't even look like a railway station.

436
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
This is the new [Wuhan] railway station

437
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
for the high-speed trains.

438
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
China already has a bigger network

439
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
than any other country in the world

440
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,820
and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.

441
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Or take this: now this is an idea,

442
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
but it's an idea to be tried out shortly

443
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
in a suburb of Beijing.

444
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Here you have a megabus,

445
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.

446
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
It travels on rails

447
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
down a suburban road,

448
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
and the cars travel underneath it.

449
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.

450
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Now this is the way things are going to move,

451
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
because China has a very specific problem,

452
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
which is different from Europe

453
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
and different from the United States:

454
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
China has huge numbers of people and no space.

455
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
So this is a solution to a situation

456
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
where China's going to have

457
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
many, many, many cities

458
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
over 20 million people.

459
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Okay, so how would I like to finish?

460
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Well, what should our attitude be

461
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
towards this world

462
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
that we see

463
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
very rapidly developing

464
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
before us?

465
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.

466
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
But I want to argue, above all,

467
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,820
a big-picture positive for this world.

468
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
For 200 years,

469
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,820
the world was essentially governed

470
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,820
by a fragment of the human population.

471
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,820
That's what Europe and North America represented.

472
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
The arrival of countries

473
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
like China and India --

474
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
between them 38 percent of the world's population --

475
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,820
and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,

476
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,820
represent the most important single act

477
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
of democratization

478
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
in the last 200 years.

479
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Civilizations and cultures,

480
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,820
which had been ignored, which had no voice,

481
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
which were not listened to, which were not known about,

482
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
will have a different sort

483
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
of representation in this world.

484
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
As humanists, we must welcome, surely,

485
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
this transformation,

486
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
and we will have to learn

487
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
about these civilizations.

488
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
This big ship here

489
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
was the one sailed in by Zheng He

490
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
in the early 15th century

491
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
on his great voyages

492
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
around the South China Sea, the East China Sea

493
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,820
and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.

494
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,820
The little boat in front of it

495
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
was the one in which, 80 years later,

496
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.

497
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
(Laughter)

498
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Or, look carefully

499
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
at this silk scroll

500
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
made by ZhuZhou

501
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
in 1368.

502
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I think they're playing golf.

503
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.

504
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Welcome to the future. Thank you.

505
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
(Applause)
