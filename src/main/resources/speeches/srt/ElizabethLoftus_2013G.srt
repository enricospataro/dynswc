1
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:16,661
I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on

2
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,224
involving a man named Steve Titus.

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,253
Titus was a restaurant manager.

4
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:27,343
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,

5
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:29,238
he was engaged to Gretchen,

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,186
about to be married, she was the love of his life.

7
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,470
And one night, the couple went out

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,475
for a romantic restaurant meal.

9
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,123
They were on their way home,

10
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:42,073
and they were pulled over by a police officer.

11
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,390
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,277
a car that was driven earlier in the evening

13
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:52,683
by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,

14
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:56,277
and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.

15
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:58,855
So the police took a picture of Titus,

16
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,622
they put it in a photo lineup,

17
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:03,782
they later showed it to the victim,

18
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:05,942
and she pointed to Titus' photo.

19
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:09,563
She said, "That one's the closest."

20
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:13,451
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,

21
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,792
and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,

22
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,888
the rape victim got on the stand

23
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:23,230
and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,156
And Titus was convicted.

25
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,130
He proclaimed his innocence,

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,712
his family screamed at the jury,

27
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:33,583
his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,

28
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,978
and Titus is taken away to jail.

29
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,436
So what would you do at this point?

30
00:01:40,436 --> 00:01:42,072
What would you do?

31
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,872
and yet he got an idea.

33
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,303
He called up the local newspaper,

34
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:53,690
he got the interest of an investigative journalist,

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,426
and that journalist actually found the real rapist,

36
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:01,779
a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,

37
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:05,071
a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes

38
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,403
in that area,

39
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,577
and when this information was given to the judge,

40
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:12,513
the judge set Titus free.

41
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:16,544
And really, that's where this case should have ended.

42
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,667
It should have been over.

43
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,187
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,

44
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:24,023
a year of accusation and trial, but over.

45
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:26,070
It didn't end that way.

46
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,748
Titus was so bitter.

47
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,328
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.

48
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,171
He lost his fiancée.

49
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,077
She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.

50
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,223
He lost his entire savings,

51
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:41,081
and so he decided to file a lawsuit

52
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,362
against the police and others whom he felt

53
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,681
were responsible for his suffering.

54
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:50,394
And that's when I really started working on this case,

55
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,355
trying to figure out

56
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,429
how did that victim go from

57
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:55,957
"That one's the closest"

58
00:02:55,957 --> 00:03:00,707
to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."

59
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,986
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.

60
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:07,020
He spent every waking moment thinking about it,

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,171
and just days before he was to have his day in court,

62
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,390
he woke up in the morning,

63
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,198
doubled over in pain,

64
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,892
and died of a stress-related heart attack.

65
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:21,079
He was 35 years old.

66
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,889
So I was asked to work on Titus' case

67
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,404
because I'm a psychological scientist.

68
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:32,231
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.

69
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,620
And if I meet somebody on an airplane --

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,716
this happened on the way over to Scotland --

71
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,546
if I meet somebody on an airplane,

72
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:42,591
and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"

73
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,042
and I say "I study memory,"

74
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,422
they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,

75
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:50,221
or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's

76
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,301
or some kind of memory problem,

77
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,517
but I have to tell them

78
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:58,022
I don't study when people forget.

79
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:01,024
I study the opposite: when they remember,

80
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,777
when they remember things that didn't happen

81
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,742
or remember things that were different

82
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,767
from the way they really were.

83
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:12,503
I study false memories.

84
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:16,810
Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person

85
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,115
to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.

86
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:24,423
In one project in the United States,

87
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:26,675
information has been gathered

88
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:30,609
on 300 innocent people,

89
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:34,504
300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.

90
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:39,804
They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,

91
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,231
and now DNA testing has proven

92
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,147
that they are actually innocent.

93
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,668
And when those cases have been analyzed,

94
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,809
three quarters of them

95
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:55,420
are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,683
Well, why?

97
00:04:56,683 --> 00:05:00,134
Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people

98
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,418
and the jurors who convicted Titus,

99
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,659
many people believe that memory

100
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,306
works like a recording device.

101
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,563
You just record the information,

102
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:11,210
then you call it up and play it back

103
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,637
when you want to answer questions or identify images.

104
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,800
But decades of work in psychology

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,953
has shown that this just isn't true.

106
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,383
Our memories are constructive.

107
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:23,952
They're reconstructive.

108
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:27,433
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:

109
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:32,546
You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.

110
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:37,795
I first started studying this constructive memory process

111
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,210
in the 1970s.

112
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,633
I did my experiments that involved showing people

113
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,138
simulated crimes and accidents

114
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,656
and asking them questions about what they remember.

115
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:54,595
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident

116
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:55,873
and we asked people,

117
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,737
how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?

118
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,371
And we asked other people,

119
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:04,060
how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

120
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,062
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question,

121
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:10,347
the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,

122
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:14,344
and moreover, that leading "smashed" question

123
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:17,204
caused people to be more likely to tell us

124
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:20,271
that they saw broken glass in the accident scene

125
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:24,050
when there wasn't any broken glass at all.

126
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,939
In another study, we showed a simulated accident

127
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,599
where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,

128
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,531
and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,

129
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:39,380
many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,837
at the intersection, not a stop sign.

131
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,026
And you might be thinking, well, you know,

132
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:46,349
these are filmed events,

133
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,277
they are not particularly stressful.

134
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:51,011
Would the same kind of mistakes be made

135
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,962
with a really stressful event?

136
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:57,053
In a study we published just a few months ago,

137
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,357
we have an answer to this question,

138
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:02,121
because what was unusual about this study

139
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:07,753
is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.

140
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,982
The subjects in this study

141
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:12,492
were members of the U.S. military

142
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:16,917
who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise

143
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,699
to teach them what it's going to be like for them

144
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,617
if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.

145
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,047
And as part of this training exercise,

146
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:29,576
these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,

147
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:34,662
hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes

148
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,479
and later on they have to try to identify

149
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,502
the person who conducted that interrogation.

150
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,325
And when we feed them suggestive information

151
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:47,103
that insinuates it's a different person,

152
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:51,140
many of them misidentify their interrogator,

153
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,975
often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely

154
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,079
resemble the real interrogator.

155
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,380
And so what these studies are showing

156
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,240
is that when you feed people misinformation

157
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,620
about some experience that they may have had,

158
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,275
you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.

159
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,475
Well out there in the real world,

160
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,366
misinformation is everywhere.

161
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:19,726
We get misinformation

162
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:22,642
not only if we're questioned in a leading way,

163
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:25,089
but if we talk to other witnesses

164
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,122
who might consciously or inadvertently feed us

165
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:30,259
some erroneous information,

166
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,989
or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,

167
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,782
all of these provide the opportunity

168
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:42,132
for this kind of contamination of our memory.

169
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:45,920
In the 1990s, we began to see

170
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,603
an even more extreme kind of memory problem.

171
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:53,699
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --

172
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,613
maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --

173
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:59,366
and they were coming out of therapy

174
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02,027
with a different problem.

175
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:05,728
Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,

176
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,711
sometimes in satanic rituals,

177
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:12,408
sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.

178
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:14,962
One woman came out of psychotherapy

179
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,390
believing that she'd endured years

180
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,292
of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy

181
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,858
and that the baby was cut from her belly.

182
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,217
But there were no physical scars

183
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,243
or any kind of physical evidence

184
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:31,124
that could have supported her story.

185
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:34,132
And when I began looking into these cases,

186
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,582
I was wondering,

187
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,910
where do these bizarre memories come from?

188
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,297
And what I found is that most of these situations

189
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:47,788
involved some particular form of psychotherapy.

190
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,387
And so I asked,

191
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,775
were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --

192
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,659
like the imagination exercises

193
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,716
or dream interpretation,

194
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,848
or in some cases hypnosis,

195
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:03,666
or in some cases exposure to false information --

196
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,453
were these leading these patients

197
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:09,130
to develop these very bizarre,

198
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,061
unlikely memories?

199
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,220
And I designed some experiments

200
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,245
to try to study the processes that were being used

201
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,318
in this psychotherapy so I could study

202
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,869
the development of these very rich false memories.

203
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:28,277
In one of the first studies we did,

204
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,630
we used suggestion,

205
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,693
a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,

206
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:36,803
we used this kind of suggestion

207
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,655
and planted a false memory

208
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:41,732
that when you were a kid, five or six years old,

209
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,983
you were lost in a shopping mall.

210
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:46,483
You were frightened. You were crying.

211
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,997
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person

212
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,849
and reunited with the family.

213
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,457
And we succeeded in planting this memory

214
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:57,563
in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.

215
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,568
And you might be thinking, well,

216
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,914
that's not particularly stressful.

217
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:05,283
But we and other investigators have planted

218
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:08,041
rich false memories of things that were

219
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,956
much more unusual and much more stressful.

220
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:13,495
So in a study done in Tennessee,

221
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,911
researchers planted the false memory

222
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,485
that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned

223
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:20,992
and had to be rescued by a life guard.

224
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,295
And in a study done in Canada,

225
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:25,819
researchers planted the false memory

226
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,047
that when you were a kid,

227
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,777
something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal

228
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,159
happened to you,

229
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,581
succeeding with about half of their subjects.

230
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:37,933
And in a study done in Italy,

231
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,591
researchers planted the false memory,

232
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:45,803
when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.

233
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,010
I do want to add that it might seem

234
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,749
like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects

235
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,349
in the name of science,

236
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:57,987
but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation

237
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,962
by research ethics boards

238
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,304
that have made the decision

239
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,377
that the temporary discomfort that some

240
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:08,461
of these subjects might experience in these studies

241
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,361
is outweighed by the importance of this problem

242
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,468
for understanding memory processes

243
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,814
and the abuse of memory that is going on

244
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:22,107
in some places in the world.

245
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:25,145
Well, to my surprise,

246
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,574
when I published this work and began to speak out

247
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:32,469
against this particular brand of psychotherapy,

248
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:36,449
it created some pretty bad problems for me:

249
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:41,350
hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,

250
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,026
who felt under attack,

251
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:46,554
and by the patients whom they had influenced.

252
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:49,491
I had sometimes armed guards at speeches

253
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,396
that I was invited to give,

254
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,613
people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.

255
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,594
But probably the worst

256
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,361
was I suspected that a woman

257
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,785
was innocent of abuse

258
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:05,621
that was being claimed by her grown daughter.

259
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:09,038
She accused her mother of sexual abuse

260
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,897
based on a repressed memory.

261
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:13,780
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story

262
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,214
to be filmed and presented in public places.

263
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,723
I was suspicious of this story,

264
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:22,023
and so I started to investigate,

265
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:26,506
and eventually found information that convinced me

266
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,795
that this mother was innocent.

267
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:31,756
I published an exposé on the case,

268
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:35,200
and a little while later, the accusing daughter

269
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,721
filed a lawsuit.

270
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:39,076
Even though I'd never mentioned her name,

271
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:43,438
she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.

272
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:46,161
And I went through nearly five years

273
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:52,713
of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,

274
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:56,387
but finally, finally, it was over and I could really

275
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,811
get back to my work.

276
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:01,296
In the process, however, I became part

277
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,950
of a disturbing trend in America

278
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,057
where scientists are being sued

279
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:10,656
for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.

280
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:14,014
When I got back to my work, I asked this question:

281
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,412
if I plant a false memory in your mind,

282
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:18,256
does it have repercussions?

283
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,215
Does it affect your later thoughts,

284
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,316
your later behaviors?

285
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,343
Our first study planted a false memory

286
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,669
that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:

287
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,668
hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.

288
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,858
And we found that once we planted this false memory,

289
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,309
people didn't want to eat the foods as much

290
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,569
at an outdoor picnic.

291
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:42,442
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.

292
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,800
If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory

293
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,821
involving a healthy food like asparagus,

294
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,296
we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.

295
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,670
And so what these studies are showing

296
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,785
is that you can plant false memories

297
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:57,198
and they have repercussions

298
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,283
that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.

299
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:04,707
Well, along with this ability

300
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:07,630
to plant memories and control behavior

301
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,811
obviously come some important ethical issues,

302
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,870
like, when should we use this mind technology?

303
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,550
And should we ever ban its use?

304
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,333
Therapists can't ethically plant false memories

305
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,920
in the mind of their patients

306
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,484
even if it would help the patient,

307
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,106
but there's nothing to stop a parent

308
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:31,555
from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.

309
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,160
And when I suggested this publicly,

310
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,506
it created an outcry again.

311
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:41,539
"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."

312
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,784
Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)

313
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:53,281
I mean, another way to think about this is,

314
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:55,314
which would you rather have,

315
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:58,343
a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,

316
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,875
all the things that go with it,

317
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,891
or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?

318
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:06,282
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.

319
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:10,259
But maybe my work has made me different from most people.

320
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,338
Most people cherish their memories,

321
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,492
know that they represent their identity,

322
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,517
who they are, where they came from.

323
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,375
And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.

324
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,580
But I know from my work

325
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,061
how much fiction is already in there.

326
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,793
If I've learned anything from these decades

327
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,203
of working on these problems, it's this:

328
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,414
just because somebody tells you something

329
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,989
and they say it with confidence,

330
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,669
just because they say it with lots of detail,

331
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,428
just because they express emotion when they say it,

332
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:43,630
it doesn't mean that it really happened.

333
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,495
We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.

334
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:51,043
We need independent corroboration.

335
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,133
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant

336
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,272
of the everyday memory mistakes

337
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:59,186
that my friends and family members make.

338
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:03,720
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,

339
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,296
the man whose whole future was snatched away

340
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,534
by a false memory.

341
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,350
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,

342
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,986
we'd do well to,

343
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:17,857
that memory, like liberty,

344
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:21,551
is a fragile thing.

345
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,489
Thank you. Thank you.

346
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:27,217
Thank you. (Applause)

347
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:30,936
Thanks very much. (Applause)
