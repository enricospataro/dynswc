1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,427
Where do you come from?

2
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,498
It's such a simple question,

3
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,681
but these days, of course, simple questions

4
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,727
bring ever more complicated answers.

5
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:24,679
People are always asking me where I come from,

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,859
and they're expecting me to say India,

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,960
and they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,526
of my blood and ancestry does come from India.

9
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:38,591
Except, I've never lived one day of my life there.

10
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,999
I can't speak even one word

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,999
of its more than 22,000 dialects.

12
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,209
So I don't think I've really earned the right

13
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,655
to call myself an Indian.

14
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:49,851
And if "Where do you come from?"

15
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:53,270
means "Where were you born and raised and educated?"

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,696
then I'm entirely of that funny little country

17
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:57,067
known as England,

18
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,478
except I left England as soon as I completed

19
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,391
my undergraduate education,

20
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:03,108
and all the time I was growing up,

21
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,904
I was the only kid in all my classes

22
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:09,033
who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes

23
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,711
represented in our textbooks.

24
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,013
And if "Where do you come from?"

25
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,658
means "Where do you pay your taxes?

26
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,252
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist?"

27
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,615
then I'm very much of the United States,

28
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,183
and I have been for 48 years now,

29
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,271
since I was a really small child.

30
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,979
Except, for many of those years,

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,248
I've had to carry around this funny little pink card

32
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:30,171
with green lines running through my face

33
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:33,022
identifying me as a permanent alien.

34
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:37,284
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there.

35
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:39,471
(Laughter)

36
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:41,058
And if "Where do you come from?"

37
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,824
means "Which place goes deepest inside you

38
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:47,004
and where do you try to spend most of your time?"

39
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,177
then I'm Japanese,

40
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,430
because I've been living as much as I can

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,815
for the last 25 years in Japan.

42
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,868
Except, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa,

43
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,010
and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese

44
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,901
would want to consider me one of them.

45
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:05,152
And I say all this just to stress

46
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,872
how very old-fashioned and straightforward

47
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:08,871
my background is,

48
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:12,919
because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,

49
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,815
most of the kids I meet

50
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:18,614
are much more international and multi-cultured than I am.

51
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:21,279
And they have one home associated with their parents,

52
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,435
but another associated with their partners,

53
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,824
a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be,

54
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,738
a fourth connected with the place they dream of being,

55
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,082
and many more besides.

56
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:36,368
And their whole life will be spent taking pieces

57
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,855
of many different places and putting them together

58
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,697
into a stained glass whole.

59
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:45,138
Home for them is really a work in progress.

60
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:47,563
It's like a project on which they're constantly adding

61
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:50,868
upgrades and improvements and corrections.

62
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,763
And for more and more of us,

63
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:57,218
home has really less to do with a piece of soil

64
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,969
than, you could say, with a piece of soul.

65
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,363
If somebody suddenly asks me, "Where's your home?"

66
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:05,289
I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends

67
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,556
or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.

68
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,413
And I'd always felt this way,

69
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:14,156
but it really came home to me, as it were,

70
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,874
some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs

71
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,576
in my parents' house in California,

72
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,402
and I looked through the living room windows

73
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:27,580
and I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames,

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,066
one of those wildfires that regularly tear through

75
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:33,897
the hills of California and many other such places.

76
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,922
And three hours later, that fire had reduced

77
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:39,666
my home and every last thing in it

78
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,684
except for me to ash.

79
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,394
And when I woke up the next morning,

80
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,955
I was sleeping on a friend's floor,

81
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:49,513
the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush

82
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:52,080
I had just bought from an all-night supermarket.

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,986
Of course, if anybody asked me then,

84
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,345
"Where is your home?"

85
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:59,337
I literally couldn't point to any physical construction.

86
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:04,069
My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me.

87
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,061
And in so many ways, I think this is a terrific liberation.

88
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,255
Because when my grandparents were born,

89
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,782
they pretty much had their sense of home,

90
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:16,274
their sense of community, even their sense of enmity,

91
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,199
assigned to them at birth,

92
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,177
and didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that.

93
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,884
And nowadays, at least some of us can choose our sense of home,

94
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:27,042
create our sense of community,

95
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:30,623
fashion our sense of self, and in so doing

96
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,760
maybe step a little beyond

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,528
some of the black and white divisions

98
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,378
of our grandparents' age.

99
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:38,262
No coincidence that the president

100
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,993
of the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan,

101
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:42,600
partly raised in Indonesia,

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,199
has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.

103
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,663
The number of people living in countries not their own

104
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:54,450
now comes to 220 million,

105
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,064
and that's an almost unimaginable number,

106
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,814
but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada

107
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,730
and the whole population of Australia

108
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,910
and then the whole population of Australia again

109
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,682
and the whole population of Canada again

110
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,365
and doubled that number,

111
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,508
you would still have fewer people than belong

112
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,739
to this great floating tribe.

113
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,516
And the number of us who live outside

114
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,609
the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly,

115
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:23,239
by 64 million just in the last 12 years,

116
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,719
that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans.

117
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:31,393
Already, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth.

118
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:34,249
And in fact, in Canada's largest city, Toronto,

119
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:37,939
the average resident today is what used to be called

120
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,031
a foreigner, somebody born in a very different country.

121
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,820
And I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign

122
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,417
is that it slaps you awake.

123
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,221
You can't take anything for granted.

124
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,955
Travel, for me, is a little bit like being in love,

125
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:57,012
because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked "on."

126
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:01,013
Suddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.

127
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:05,329
The real voyage of discovery, as Marcel Proust famously said,

128
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,327
consists not in seeing new sights,

129
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,697
but in looking with new eyes.

130
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:12,663
And of course, once you have new eyes,

131
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,100
even the old sights, even your home

132
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,777
become something different.

133
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,595
Many of the people living in countries not their own

134
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,678
are refugees who never wanted to leave home

135
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:26,394
and ache to go back home.

136
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,041
But for the fortunate among us,

137
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,322
I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities.

138
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,387
Certainly when I'm traveling,

139
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,701
especially to the major cities of the world,

140
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,826
the typical person I meet today

141
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:42,371
will be, let's say, a half-Korean, half-German young woman

142
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,074
living in Paris.

143
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:47,132
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,

144
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,346
half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,

145
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:52,823
she recognizes him as kin.

146
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:57,162
She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him

147
00:06:57,162 --> 00:07:00,755
than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany.

148
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,513
So they become friends. They fall in love.

149
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,791
They move to New York City.

150
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,954
(Laughter)

151
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:09,340
Or Edinburgh.

152
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,614
And the little girl who arises out of their union

153
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:14,745
will of course be not Korean or German

154
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:17,288
or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian

155
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,393
or even American, but a wonderful

156
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:23,527
and constantly evolving mix of all those places.

157
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,292
And potentially, everything about the way

158
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,041
that young woman dreams about the world,

159
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,087
writes about the world, thinks about the world,

160
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,057
could be something different,

161
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:37,252
because it comes out of this almost unprecedented

162
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:39,225
blend of cultures.

163
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,309
Where you come from now is much less important

164
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,957
than where you're going.

165
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,353
More and more of us are rooted in the future

166
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:49,649
or the present tense as much as in the past.

167
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,212
And home, we know, is not just the place

168
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,322
where you happen to be born.

169
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:58,795
It's the place where you become yourself.

170
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:01,217
And yet,

171
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,882
there is one great problem with movement,

172
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:07,093
and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings

173
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,711
when you're in midair.

174
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,997
Some years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated

175
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,519
one million miles on United Airlines alone.

176
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,569
You all know that crazy system,

177
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,297
six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.

178
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:24,803
(Laughter)

179
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,079
And I began to think that really,

180
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,358
movement was only as good as the sense of stillness

181
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:34,205
that you could bring to it to put it into perspective.

182
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,059
And eight months after my house burned down,

183
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,781
I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school,

184
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:43,313
and he said, "I've got the perfect place for you."

185
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,321
"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical

186
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,799
when people say things like that.

187
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,169
"No, honestly," he went on,

188
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,015
"it's only three hours away by car,

189
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,630
and it's not very expensive,

190
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,209
and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before."

191
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,408
"Hmm." I was beginning to get slightly intrigued. "What is it?"

192
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,187
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —

193
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:05,769
"Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage."

194
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,735
This was the wrong answer.

195
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,282
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,

196
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:14,880
so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime.

197
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,151
Several lifetimes, actually.

198
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:19,709
But my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic,

199
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,123
nor were most of his students,

200
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:23,943
but he took his classes there every spring.

201
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:28,706
And as he had it, even the most restless, distractible,

202
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:32,740
testosterone-addled 15-year-old Californian boy

203
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,976
only had to spend three days in silence

204
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:40,230
and something in him cooled down and cleared out.

205
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,539
He found himself.

206
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,234
And I thought, "Anything that works for a 15-year-old boy

207
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,617
ought to work for me."

208
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:50,227
So I got in my car, and I drove three hours north

209
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,703
along the coast,

210
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,263
and the roads grew emptier and narrower,

211
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:57,027
and then I turned onto an even narrower path,

212
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,667
barely paved, that snaked for two miles

213
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,190
up to the top of a mountain.

214
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,029
And when I got out of my car,

215
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:08,399
the air was pulsing.

216
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,259
The whole place was absolutely silent,

217
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,719
but the silence wasn't an absence of noise.

218
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:17,760
It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening.

219
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,271
And at my feet was the great, still blue plate

220
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,525
of the Pacific Ocean.

221
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:27,959
All around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush.

222
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,605
And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping.

223
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:32,470
Small but eminently comfortable,

224
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,679
it had a bed and a rocking chair

225
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,853
and a long desk and even longer picture windows

226
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:42,142
looking out on a small, private, walled garden,

227
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,342
and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass

228
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:48,334
running down to the sea.

229
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,503
And I sat down, and I began to write,

230
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,007
and write, and write,

231
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:56,620
even though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk.

232
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,114
And by the time I got up, four hours had passed.

233
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:03,243
Night had fallen,

234
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:07,999
and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars,

235
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,251
and I could see the tail lights of cars

236
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:14,464
disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south.

237
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:18,172
And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day

238
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,122
vanishing.

239
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,934
And the next day, when I woke up

240
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:25,402
in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops,

241
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:29,555
the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours.

242
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,254
It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling,

243
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:37,868
but it also profoundly felt like coming home.

244
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,484
And I'm not a religious person,

245
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:40,950
so I didn't go to the services.

246
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,554
I didn't consult the monks for guidance.

247
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:46,334
I just took walks along the monastery road

248
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,683
and sent postcards to loved ones.

249
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,517
I looked at the clouds,

250
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:54,842
and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually,

251
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,336
which is nothing at all.

252
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,644
And I started to go back to this place,

253
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:03,212
and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there

254
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:06,743
invisibly just by sitting still,

255
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:09,868
and certainly coming to my most critical decisions

256
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:12,150
the way I never could when I was racing

257
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,723
from the last email to the next appointment.

258
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:17,352
And I began to think that something in me

259
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,341
had really been crying out for stillness,

260
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:20,783
but of course I couldn't hear it

261
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,096
because I was running around so much.

262
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:25,328
I was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold

263
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,559
and then complains that he can't see a thing.

264
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,100
And I thought back to that wonderful phrase

265
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,472
I had learned as a boy from Seneca,

266
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:37,130
in which he says, "That man is poor

267
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,503
not who has little but who hankers after more."

268
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,595
And, of course, I'm not suggesting

269
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,266
that anybody here go into a monastery.

270
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,021
That's not the point.

271
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:51,739
But I do think it's only by stopping movement

272
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:54,035
that you can see where to go.

273
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,640
And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world

274
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,209
that you can see what you most deeply care about

275
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,615
and find a home.

276
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,658
And I've noticed so many people now

277
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:08,746
take conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes

278
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,279
every morning just collecting themselves

279
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
in one corner of the room without their devices,

280
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,912
or go running every evening,

281
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,868
or leave their cell phones behind

282
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:21,785
when they go to have a long conversation with a friend.

283
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,954
Movement is a fantastic privilege,

284
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:28,311
and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents

285
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,432
could never have dreamed of doing.

286
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,337
But movement, ultimately,

287
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:36,878
only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to.

288
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,669
And home, in the end, is of course

289
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,537
not just the place where you sleep.

290
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,176
It's the place where you stand.

291
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,633
Thank you.

292
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:52,326
(Applause)
