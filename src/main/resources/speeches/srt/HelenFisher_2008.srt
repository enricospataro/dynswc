1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
have put 37 people who are madly in love

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
and we're just starting our third experiment:

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
studying people who report that they're still in love

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
after 10 to 25 years of marriage.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
So, this is the short story of that research.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,820
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
It was built by the grandest Sun King,

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
of the grandest city-state,

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
of the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,820
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
He stood over six feet tall.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
He lived into his 80s,

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,820
and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,820
that he was deeply in love with his wife.

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,820
So, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox,

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
the sun rises behind his temple,

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon,

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
After 1,300 years, these two lovers

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
still touch and kiss from their tomb.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Around the world, people love.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
They sing for love, they dance for love,

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
they compose poems and stories about love.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
They tell myths and legends about love.

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,820
They pine for love, they live for love,

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
they kill for love, and they die for love.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
As Walt Whitman once said,

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
he said, "Oh, I would stake all for you."

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
They've never found a society that did not have it.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
But love isn't always a happy experience.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
In one study of college students,

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
they asked a lot of questions about love,

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
but the two that stood out to me the most were,

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
"Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,820
And the second question was,

43
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,820
"Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"

44
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,820
And almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.

45
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
So, before I start telling you about the brain,

47
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
I want to read for you

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.

49
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
There's other love poems that are, of course, just as good,

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
but I don't think this one can be surpassed.

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,820
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska

52
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,820
to a missionary in 1896, and here it is.

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,820
I've never had the opportunity to say it before.

54
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.

55
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you,

57
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
consumed by fire with my love for you.

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
I remember what you said to me.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
I am thinking of your love for me.

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
I am torn by your love for me.

61
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Pain and more pain --

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
where are you going with my love?

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
I am told you will go from here.

64
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,820
I am told you will leave me here.

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
My body is numb with grief.

66
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Remember what I said, my love.

67
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Emily Dickinson once wrote,

69
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
"Parting is all we need to know of hell."

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
How many people have suffered

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
in all the millions of years of human evolution?

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
How many people around the world

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
are dancing with elation at this very minute?

74
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.

75
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
So, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain

76
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and study this madness.

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Our first study of people who were happily in love

78
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
has been widely publicized,

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
so I'm only going to say a very little about it.

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,820
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
called the ventral tegmental area.

82
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells,

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant,

84
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
and spray it to many brain regions.

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Indeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.

86
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
It's way below your cognitive thinking process.

87
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
It's below your emotions.

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,

89
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
associated with wanting, with motivation,

90
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
with focus and with craving.

91
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
In fact, the same brain region where we found activity

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,820
becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.

93
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high --

94
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
at least you come down from cocaine.

95
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.

96
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
You lose your sense of self.

97
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,820
You can't stop thinking about another human being.

98
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Somebody is camping in your head.

99
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,

100
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
"My longing had no time when it ceases."

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Wild is love.

102
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project,

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
are looking at the data of the people

105
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.

106
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
It was very difficult actually,

107
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
putting these people in the machine,

108
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
because they were in such bad shape.

109
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,820
(Laughter)

110
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
So anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.

111
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
We found activity in the brain region,

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
in exactly the same brain region

113
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
associated with intense romantic love.

114
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
What a bad deal.

115
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
You know, when you've been dumped,

116
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being,

117
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
and then go on with your life --

118
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
but no, you just love them harder.

119
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,820
As the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said,

120
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
he said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."

121
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
And indeed, we now know why.

122
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Two thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.

123
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
That brain system -- the reward system

124
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,820
for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus --

125
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
becomes more active when you can't get what you want.

126
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
In this case, life's greatest prize:

127
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
an appropriate mating partner.

128
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
We found activity in other brain regions also --

129
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,820
in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.

130
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
You know, you're lying there, you're looking at the picture,

131
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,820
and you're in this machine,

132
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,820
and you're calculating, you know, what went wrong.

133
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
How, you know, what have I lost?

134
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.

135
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,820
It comes from a David Mamet play,

136
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
and there's two con artists in the play,

137
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and the woman is conning the man,

138
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
and the man looks at the woman and says,

139
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,820
"Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."

140
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
And indeed, it's this part of the brain,

141
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
the core of the nucleus accumbens, actually, that is becoming active

142
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
as you're measuring your gains and losses.

143
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
It's also the brain region that becomes active

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
when you're willing to take enormous risks

145
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
for huge gains and huge losses.

146
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Last but not least, we found activity in a brain region

147
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,820
associated with deep attachment to another individual.

148
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,820
No wonder people suffer around the world,

149
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
and we have so many crimes of passion.

150
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
When you've been rejected in love,

151
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,820
not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love,

152
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.

153
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Moreover, this brain circuit for reward is working,

154
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,820
and you're feeling intense energy, intense focus,

155
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all

156
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,820
to win life's greatest prize.

157
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
So, what have I learned from this experiment

158
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
that I would like to tell the world?

159
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Foremost, I have come to think

160
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
that romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.

161
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you out there,

162
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
looking for a whole range of partners.

163
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy

164
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy,

165
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
and start the mating process with this single individual.

166
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love,

167
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,820
what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato,

168
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
over 2,000 years ago.

169
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,820
He said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.

170
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
It is a need. It is an urge.

171
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
It is a homeostatic imbalance.

172
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."

173
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction:

174
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well,

175
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,820
and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
And indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.

177
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,

178
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
you crave them, you distort reality,

179
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.

180
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction:

181
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
tolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more;

182
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
withdrawals; and last, relapse.

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,820
I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.

184
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
It's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.

185
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
And she was driving along in her car the other day,

186
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio

187
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
that reminded her of this man.

188
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
And she -- not only did the instant craving come back,

189
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
but she had to pull over

190
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
from the side of the road and cry.

191
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
So, one thing I would like the medical community,

192
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
and the legal community, and even the college community,

193
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
to see if they can understand, that indeed,

194
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,820
romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth.

195
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,820
I would also like to tell the world that animals love.

196
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
There's not an animal on this planet

197
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
that will copulate with anything that comes along.

198
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Too old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won't do it.

199
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage --

200
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
and you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box,

201
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with --

202
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
but I've looked in a hundred species,

203
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,820
and everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.

204
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
As a matter of fact ethologists know this.

205
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,820
There are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"

206
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,820
selective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.

207
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
And indeed, there are now three academic articles

208
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
in which they've looked at this attraction,

209
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
which may only last for a second,

210
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
but it's a definite attraction,

211
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,820
and either this same brain region, this reward system,

212
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
or the chemicals of that reward system are involved.

213
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
In fact, I think animal attraction can be instant --

214
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.

215
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
And I think that this is really the origin

216
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
of what you and I call "love at first sight."

217
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
People have often asked me whether

218
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
what I know about love has spoiled it for me.

219
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
And I just simply say, "Hardly."

220
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake,

221
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
and then when you sit down and eat that cake,

222
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
you can still feel that joy.

223
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And certainly, I make all the same mistakes

224
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
that everybody else does too,

225
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
but it's really deepened my understanding

226
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,820
and compassion, really, for all human life.

227
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
As a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself

228
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,820
looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.

229
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry

230
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
for the chicken on my dinner plate,

231
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,820
when I think of how intense this brain system is.

232
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Our newest experiment has been hatched

233
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
by my colleague, Art Aron --

234
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
putting people who are reporting that they are still in love,

235
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
in a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.

236
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
We've put five people in so far,

237
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,820
and indeed, we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying.

238
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,820
The brain areas

239
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
associated with intense romantic love

240
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
still become active, 25 years later.

241
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
There are still many questions to be answered

242
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
and asked about romantic love.

243
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
The question that I'm working on right this minute --

244
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
and I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end --

245
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,820
is, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?

246
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
I never would have even thought to think of this,

247
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
but Match.com, the Internet-dating site,

248
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
came to me three years ago and asked me that question.

249
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
And I said, I don't know.

250
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
I know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love,

251
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
but I don't know why you fall in love with one person

252
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
rather than another.

253
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820
And so, I've spent the last three years on this.

254
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person

255
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
rather than another, that psychologists can tell you.

256
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
And we tend to fall in love with somebody

257
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
from the same socioeconomic background,

258
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
the same general level of intelligence,

259
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
the same general level of good looks,

260
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
the same religious values.

261
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Your childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.

262
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
And that's about it, that's all they know.

263
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
No, they've never found the way two personalities

264
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
fit together to make a good relationship.

265
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
So, it began to occur to me

266
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
that maybe your biology pulls you

267
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
towards some people rather than another.

268
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,820
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree

269
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,820
you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.

270
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I think we've evolved four very broad personality types

271
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,820
associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.

272
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
And on this dating site that I have created,

273
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,820
called Chemistry.com, I ask you first a series of questions

274
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
to see to what degree you express these chemicals,

275
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,820
and I'm watching who chooses who to love.

276
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.

277
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,820
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.

278
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm putting the data together now,

279
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
and at some point -- there will always be magic to love,

280
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
but I think I will come closer to understanding

281
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
why it is you can walk into a room

282
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
and everybody is from your background,

283
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
your same general level of intelligence,

284
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
your same general level of good looks,

285
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
and you don't feel pulled towards all of them.

286
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
I think there's biology to that.

287
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I think we're going to end up, in the next few years,

288
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms

289
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
that pull us to one person rather than another.

290
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,820
So, I will close with this. These are my older people.

291
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Faulkner once said, "The past is not dead,

292
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
it's not even the past."

293
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage

294
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
from our yesteryear in the human brain.

295
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
And so, there's one thing

296
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,820
that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature,

297
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
and this reminds me of it.

298
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
These are two women.

299
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do.

300
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking.

301
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
We swivel towards each other,

302
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,820
we do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.

303
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
This is intimacy to women.

304
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
I think it comes from millions of years

305
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
of holding that baby in front of your face,

306
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.

307
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.

308
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
(Laughter)

309
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
As soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.

310
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
(Laughter)

311
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
I think it comes from millions of years

312
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush,

313
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
looking straight ahead,

314
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.

315
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
(Laughter)

316
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
I think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies,

317
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
they sat side by side with friends.

318
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,820
So my final statement is: love is in us.

319
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
It's deeply embedded in the brain.

320
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you.

321
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,820
(Applause)
