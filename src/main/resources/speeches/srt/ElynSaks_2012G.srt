1
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,100
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,909
I've spent hundreds of days

3
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,396
in psychiatric hospitals.

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,201
I might have ended up spending

5
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:25,028
most of my life on the back ward of a hospital,

6
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:27,228
but that isn't how my life turned out.

7
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:30,676
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals

8
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,165
for almost three decades,

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,108
perhaps my proudest accomplishment.

10
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:36,302
That's not to say that I've remained clear

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,909
of all psychiatric struggles.

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,334
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and

13
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:43,340
got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,925
announced to me that he was going to close his practice

15
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,805
in three months, several years

16
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,502
before I had planned to leave New Haven.

17
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:52,271
White had been enormously helpful to me,

18
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,328
and the thought of his leaving

19
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,214
shattered me.

20
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,684
My best friend Steve,

21
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,436
sensing that something was terribly wrong,

22
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,268
flew out to New Haven to be with me.

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,356
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings:

24
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:04,871
"I opened the door to my studio apartment.

25
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,044
Steve would later tell me that,

26
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,780
for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,781
could have prepared him for what he saw that day.

28
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,454
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.

29
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:17,014
I was gaunt. I walked

30
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,628
as though my legs were wooden.

31
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:21,655
My face looked and felt like a mask.

32
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:24,499
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so

33
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:25,454
in the middle of the day

34
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:27,468
the apartment was in near total darkness.

35
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,220
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.

36
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,536
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated

37
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:36,669
many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day

38
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:39,357
he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.

39
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,436
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,

40
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,560
where I sat in silence for several moments.

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,405
'Thank you for coming, Steve.

42
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:50,456
Crumbling world, word, voice.

43
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:52,325
Tell the clocks to stop.

44
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,116
Time is. Time has come.'

45
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:57,357
'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.

46
00:01:57,357 --> 00:02:00,788
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.

47
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,415
'Gravity is pulling me down.

48
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,548
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"

49
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:08,260
As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital

50
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,764
on three different occasions for lengthy periods.

51
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,556
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,

52
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:16,151
and gave me a prognosis of "grave."

53
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,581
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,

54
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,285
and work at menial jobs.

55
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,285
Fortunately, I did not actually

56
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:25,060
enact that grave prognosis.

57
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,901
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology

58
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,526
and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,

59
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,156
I have many close friends

60
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:35,341
and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.

61
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:39,868
(Applause) Thank you.

62
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:45,142
He's definitely the star of my show.

63
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,940
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,709
describe my experience of being psychotic.

65
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,189
I hasten to add that it's my experience,

66
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,845
because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.

67
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,906
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.

68
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:01,127
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.

69
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:03,552
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,144
out of touch with reality.

71
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,966
Delusions and hallucinations

72
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,520
are hallmarks of the illness.

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,272
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive

74
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:15,088
to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.

75
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:17,438
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have

76
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,689
the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands

77
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,266
of people with my thoughts.

78
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,971
I sometimes have the idea that

79
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:25,466
nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.

80
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,802
Occasionally, I have hallucinations,

81
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,570
like one time I turned around and saw a man

82
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,147
with a raised knife.

83
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,939
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.

84
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,149
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized

85
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,695
to the point of incoherence.

86
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,574
Loose associations involves putting together words

87
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:44,357
that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,

88
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,747
and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."

89
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:51,185
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not

90
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:54,600
the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,151
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.

92
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,730
Everyone has seen a street person,

93
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,753
unkempt, probably ill-fed,

94
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,330
standing outside of an office building muttering

95
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,143
to himself or shouting.

96
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,740
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,071
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array

98
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,895
of socioeconomic status, and there are people

99
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:17,425
with the illness who are full-time professionals

100
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,777
with major responsibilities.

101
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:20,988
Several years ago, I decided

102
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,423
to write down my experiences and my personal journey,

103
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:26,721
and I want to share some more of that story with you today

104
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,384
to convey the inside view.

105
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,169
So the following episode happened the seventh week

106
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,032
of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.

107
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,237
Quoting from my writings:

108
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:39,706
"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date

109
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,667
to meet in the law school library on Friday night

110
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,951
to work on our memo assignment together.

111
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,753
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways

112
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,276
that made no sense.

113
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:51,340
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.

114
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,860
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.

115
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,315
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'

116
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,331
Rebel and Val looked at me

117
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,002
as if they or I had been

118
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,582
splashed in the face with cold water.

119
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:03,138
'What are you talking about, Elyn?'

120
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:06,147
'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,

121
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,402
heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.

122
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,978
It's a flat surface. It's safe.'

123
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,562
Rebel and Val followed

124
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,011
and they asked what had gotten into me.

125
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,874
'This is the real me,' I announced,

126
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,419
waving my arms above my head.

127
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,194
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof

128
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,351
of the Yale Law School,

129
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,643
I began to sing, and not quietly either.

130
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,747
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.

131
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,058
Do you want to dance?'

132
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,533
'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'

133
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,989
'High? Me? No way, no drugs.

134
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,556
Come to the Florida sunshine bush,

135
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,829
where there are lemons, where they make demons.'

136
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,523
'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val

137
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,302
headed back into the library.

138
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,419
I shrugged and followed them.

139
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,786
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were

140
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,003
having the same experience of words jumping around

141
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:51,347
our cases as I was.

142
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:55,370
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.

143
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,874
'We've got to case the joint.

144
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,457
I don't believe in joints, but

145
00:05:58,457 --> 00:05:59,922
they do hold your body together.'" --

146
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:02,291
It's an example of loose associations. --

147
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,675
"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,

148
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:07,034
and once there, I couldn't settle down.

149
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,859
My head was too full of noise,

150
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:12,546
too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write

151
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,178
and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.

152
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:18,523
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,

153
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,555
moaning in fear and isolation."

154
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,682
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.

155
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,922
I had two earlier in England.

156
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,483
Continuing with the writings:

157
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,947
"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask

158
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:31,524
for an extension on the memo assignment,

159
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,681
and I began gibbering unintelligably

160
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,027
as I had the night before,

161
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,700
and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.

162
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,501
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'

163
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,468
and his whole team of goons swooped down,

164
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,877
lifted me high into the air,

165
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:45,550
and slammed me down on a metal bed

166
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,902
with such force that I saw stars.

167
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:50,460
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed

168
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,127
with thick leather straps.

169
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:55,473
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:

170
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:57,501
half groan, half scream,

171
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,845
barely human and pure terror.

172
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:02,516
Then the sound came again,

173
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:04,440
forced from somewhere deep inside my belly

174
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,037
and scraping my throat raw."

175
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:10,316
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.

176
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:13,857
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me

177
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,142
against my will was that I was

178
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,549
"gravely disabled."

179
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,645
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable

180
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,437
to do my Yale Law School homework.

181
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:24,478
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.

182
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,084
(Laughter)

183
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,773
During the next year, I would

184
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:30,925
spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.

185
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,404
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,

186
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,894
arms tied, arms and legs tied down,

187
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:40,413
arms and legs tied down with a net tied

188
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,221
tightly across my chest.

189
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:44,268
I never struck anyone.

190
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:47,174
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.

191
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,948
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have

192
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:52,645
a benign image of the experience.

193
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,620
There's nothing benign about it.

194
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,405
Every week in the United States,

195
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:59,325
it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.

196
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,941
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,

197
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,094
they suffocate, they have a heart attack.

198
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,620
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints

199
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,140
is actually saving lives or costing lives.

200
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,934
While I was preparing to write my student note

201
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,134
for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,

202
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,486
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also

203
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,571
a psychiatrist,

204
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,284
and said surely he would agree

205
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:21,580
that restraints must be degrading,

206
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,116
painful and frightening.

207
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:25,227
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,

208
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,556
"Elyn, you don't really understand:

209
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,294
These people are psychotic.

210
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,815
They're different from me and you.

211
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,579
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."

212
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,413
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,

213
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,414
no, we're not that different from him.

214
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,772
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed

215
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:43,102
and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.

216
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,254
In fact, until very recently,

217
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:47,236
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,

218
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,268
that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.

219
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,700
I've never met a psychiatric patient

220
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,094
who agreed with that view.

221
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:56,805
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry

222
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,308
but very anti-force.

223
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,299
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think

224
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,036
using force is a terrible thing to do to another person

225
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,395
with a terrible illness.

226
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,116
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles

227
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,614
to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.

228
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:12,934
For years, I had resisted medication,

229
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,924
making many, many efforts to get off.

230
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:17,599
I felt that if I could manage without medication,

231
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,637
I could prove that, after all,

232
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:22,387
I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.

233
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,694
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.

234
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:28,782
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me

235
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,282
just to stay on medication and get on with my life,

236
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:34,757
but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.

237
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,189
Quoting from the text:

238
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,829
"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time

239
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,941
I began feeling the effects.

240
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,782
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into

241
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:48,159
Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,

242
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,392
covered my face, and began shaking.

243
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:53,547
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.

244
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,715
They'd slice me up in thin slices

245
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,357
or make me swallow hot coals.

246
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:00,734
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'

247
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,819
Even in this state, what he accurately described as

248
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,510
acutely and forwardly psychotic,

249
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,523
I refused to take more medication.

250
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,323
The mission is not yet complete.

251
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,941
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,

252
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,239
I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert

253
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,547
who was following me for medication side effects.

254
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:20,568
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.

255
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,996
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,

256
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,635
and began muttering.

257
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:27,865
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.

258
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:30,330
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?'

259
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,962
'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'

260
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:33,945
said Marder.

261
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:37,097
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.

262
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,745
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?

263
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:41,322
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'

264
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:43,057
'Elyn, do you feel like you're

265
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,554
dangerous to yourself or others?

266
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,969
I think you need to be in the hospital.

267
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,826
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing

268
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:49,961
could be very discrete.'

269
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,642
'Ha, ha, ha.

270
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:53,979
You're offering to put me in hospitals?

271
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:56,922
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.

272
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,586
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"

273
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,169
At that point in the text,

274
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,074
where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband

275
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,099
made a marginal note.

276
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,706
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"

277
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,937
(Laughter)

278
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:12,689
"'I give life and I take it away.

279
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,386
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.'

280
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:17,700
Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and

281
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,208
everybody convinced me to take more medication.

282
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,154
I could no longer deny the truth,

283
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,676
and I could not change it.

284
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,325
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,

285
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:29,438
separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,

286
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,549
lay smashed and in ruins."

287
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,222
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,

288
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:37,096
but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:

289
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,488
First, I've had excellent treatment.

290
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:42,434
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy

291
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,418
for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.

292
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:49,462
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me

293
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:50,716
and know my illness.

294
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,040
These relationships have given my life a meaning

295
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,207
and a depth, and they also helped me navigate

296
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,175
my life in the face of symptoms.

297
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,343
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace

298
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,928
at USC Law School.

299
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:04,953
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs

300
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,344
but actually embraces them.

301
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:09,375
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place,

302
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,967
and occupying my mind with complex problems

303
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:15,400
has been my best and most powerful and most reliable

304
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,120
defense against my mental illness.

305
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,423
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and

306
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,339
friends, supportive work environment —

307
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,672
I did not make my illness public

308
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:26,105
until relatively late in life,

309
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,624
and that's because the stigma against mental illness

310
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,232
is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.

311
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,648
If you hear nothing else today,

312
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:37,082
please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."

313
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:40,233
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people

314
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,328
may be your spouse, they may be your child,

315
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,752
they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,

316
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,176
they may be your coworker.

317
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:49,032
So let me share some final thoughts.

318
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:52,464
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment

319
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,704
of mental illness.

320
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,760
The better we understand these illnesses, the better

321
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,968
the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments

322
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,408
we can provide, the more we can offer people care,

323
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,856
and not have to use force.

324
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,808
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.

325
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:08,856
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail

326
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,498
is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.

327
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:15,414
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer

328
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:17,898
from severe mental illness, and many of them are there

329
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,875
because they never received adequate treatment.

330
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,304
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.

331
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:26,528
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:

332
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:30,592
On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma

333
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,408
and prejudice of many kinds.

334
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:35,408
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,

335
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,536
your plays, your columns,

336
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,360
who suffer with severe mental illness.

337
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Portray them sympathetically,

338
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,759
and portray them in all the richness and depth

339
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,286
of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.

340
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,562
Recently, a friend posed a question:

341
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,337
If there were a pill I could take

342
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,148
that would instantly cure me, would I take it?

343
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,841
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke

344
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,313
was offered psychoanalysis.

345
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,625
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,

346
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,384
because my angels may flee too."

347
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:03,577
My psychosis, on the other hand,

348
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,249
is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying

349
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,185
that all my angels have already fled.

350
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:12,089
So would I take the pill? In an instant.

351
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,770
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting

352
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,163
the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,

353
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:19,445
nor am I asking anyone for their pity.

354
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,576
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share

355
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:25,209
