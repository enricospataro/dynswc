1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm going to speak today about the relationship

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
between science and human values.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
Now, it's generally understood that

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
questions of morality --

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
are questions about which science officially has no opinion.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
It's thought that science can help us

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
get what we value,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
but it can never tell us what we ought to value.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
probably here -- think that science will never answer

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
the most important questions in human life:

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
questions like, "What is worth living for?"

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
"What is worth dying for?"

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
"What constitutes a good life?"

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
So, I'm going to argue

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
science and human values is an illusion --

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
and actually quite a dangerous one

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
at this point in human history.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Now, it's often said that science

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
because science deals with facts,

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
It's often thought that there's no description

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
of the way the world is

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,820
that can tell us how the world ought to be.

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Values are a certain kind of fact.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
concerned about our fellow primates

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
than we are about insects, as indeed we are,

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
of potential happiness and suffering.

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Now, the crucial thing to notice here

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
is that this is a factual claim:

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
and the possibilities of experience

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

44
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,820
And there's no notion,

45
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
no version of human morality

46
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and human values that I've ever come across

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
that is not at some point reducible

48
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
to a concern about conscious experience

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
and its possible changes.

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Even if you get your values from religion,

51
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
even if you think that good and evil ultimately

52
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
relate to conditions after death --

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
either to an eternity of happiness with God

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
or an eternity of suffering in hell --

55
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,820
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And to say that such changes can persist after death

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
is itself a factual claim,

58
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
which, of course, may or may not be true.

59
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
in this life, for human beings,

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
we know that there is a continuum of such facts.

62
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,

63
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
where mothers cannot feed their children,

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,820
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
where people are murdered indiscriminately.

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
towards something quite a bit more idyllic,

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,820
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
And we know -- we know --

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
that there are right and wrong answers

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
to how to move in this space.

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?

74
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Probably not.

75
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,

76
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
so that when bad things happened to them

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.

78
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
There are truths to be known

79
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
about how human communities flourish,

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
whether or not we understand these truths.

81
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
And morality relates to these truths.

82
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,820
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --

84
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
from the level of the genome

85
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
on up to the level of economic systems

86
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and political arrangements.

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
But if we're going to talk about human well-being

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.

89
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it

90
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
is realized in the brain --

91
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
whatever happens after death.

92
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,

93
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
in this life, his personality --

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
his rather unfortunate personality --

95
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
is the product of his brain.

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
So the contributions of culture --

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
if culture changes us, as indeed it does,

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
it changes us by changing our brains.

99
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is

100
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
in how human beings flourish

101
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
can, at least in principle, be understood

102
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --

103
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
neuroscience, psychology, etc.

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
So, what I'm arguing is that

105
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
value's reduced to facts --

106
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
to facts about the conscious experience

107
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
of conscious beings.

108
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
And we can therefore visualize a space

109
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
of possible changes in the experience of these beings.

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,

111
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
with peaks and valleys that correspond

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
both personal and collective.

114
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
And one thing to notice is that perhaps

115
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
there are states of human well-being

116
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
that we rarely access, that few people access.

117
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
And these await our discovery.

118
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called

119
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
mystical or spiritual.

120
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access

121
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
because of how our minds are structured

122
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,820
but other minds possibly could access them.

123
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,820
that science is guaranteed to map this space,

125
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
or that we will have scientific answers to every

126
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
conceivable moral question.

127
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,

129
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,

130
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,820
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.

131
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
(Laughter)

132
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
But if questions affect human well-being

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
And just admitting this --

135
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
to the question of how humans flourish --

137
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
will change the way we talk about morality,

138
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
and will change our expectations

139
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,820
of human cooperation in the future.

140
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,820
For instance, there are 21 states in our country

141
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,

142
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,820
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,

143
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,820
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.

144
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,

145
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
are subjected to this every year.

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,820
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.

147
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
We're not talking about Connecticut.

148
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,820
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.

149
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
The creator of the universe himself

150
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
has told us not to spare the rod,

151
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
lest we spoil the child --

152
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,820
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.

153
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
But we can ask the obvious question:

154
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,820
Is it a good idea, generally speaking,

155
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
to subject children to pain

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
and violence and public humiliation

157
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development

158
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
and good behavior?

159
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
(Laughter)

160
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Is there any doubt

161
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
that this question has an answer,

162
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
and that it matters?

163
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Now, many of you might worry

164
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,

165
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.

166
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
And so, how therefore can there be an

167
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
objective notion of well-being?

168
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.

169
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
The concept of physical health is undefined.

170
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.

171
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
When this statue was carved

172
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
the average life expectancy was probably 30.

173
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
It's now around 80 in the developed world.

174
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes

175
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon

176
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,820
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.

177
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.

178
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
(Laughter)

179
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Notice that the fact that the concept of health

180
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
is open, genuinely open for revision,

181
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
does not make it vacuous.

182
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
The distinction between a healthy person

183
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and a dead one

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.

185
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:

186
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
There may be equivalent ways to thrive;

187
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society

188
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
so as to maximize human flourishing.

189
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Now, why wouldn't this

190
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
undermine an objective morality?

191
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Well think of how we talk about food:

192
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
I would never be tempted to argue to you

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
that there must be one right food to eat.

194
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
There is clearly a range of materials

195
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
that constitute healthy food.

196
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction

197
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
between food and poison.

198
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
The fact that there are many right answers

199
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
to the question, "What is food?"

200
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
does not tempt us

201
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,820
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.

202
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Many people worry

203
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
that a universal morality would require

204
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.

205
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,

206
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
it must always be wrong to lie,

207
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
and if you can find an exception,

208
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
well then there's no such thing as moral truth.

209
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Why would we think this?

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.

211
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Now, if you're going to play good chess,

212
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"

213
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
is very good to follow.

214
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
But it clearly admits some exceptions.

215
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.

216
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,820
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.

217
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.

218
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
The fact that there are exceptions here does not

219
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
change that at all.

220
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves

221
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.

222
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,820
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:

223
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
What to do about them?

224
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Well this is one thing you can do about them:

225
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
You can cover them up.

226
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community

227
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,820
that while we may not like this,

228
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
we might think of this as "wrong"

229
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
in Boston or Palo Alto,

230
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
who are we to say

231
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
that the proud denizens of an ancient culture

232
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
are wrong to force their wives and daughters

233
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
to live in cloth bags?

234
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong

235
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
to beat them with lengths of steel cable,

236
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
or throw battery acid in their faces

237
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,820
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?

238
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Well, who are we not to say this?

239
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Who are we to pretend

240
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,820
that we know so little about human well-being

241
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,820
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?

242
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,820
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --

243
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.

244
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
But what does voluntary mean

245
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
in a community where,

246
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
when a girl gets raped,

247
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
her father's first impulse,

248
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,820
rather often, is to murder her out of shame?

249
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:

250
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Your daughter gets raped,

251
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
and what you want to do is kill her.

252
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
What are the chances that represents

253
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,820
a peak of human flourishing?

254
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
perfect solution in our own society.

256
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
For instance,

257
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere

258
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
in the civilized world.

259
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Now, granted, for many men

260
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.

261
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
(Laughter)

262
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
But if we are in a reflective mood,

263
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
we can ask,

264
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
"Is this the perfect expression

265
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
of psychological balance

266
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"

267
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
I mean, is this the optimal environment

268
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,820
in which to raise our children?

269
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place

270
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
on the spectrum

271
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
between these two extremes

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
that represents a place of better balance.

273
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:53,820
(Applause)

274
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Perhaps there are many such places --

275
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
again, given other changes in human culture

276
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

277
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
But the thing to notice is that there will be

278
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,820
many more ways not to be on a peak.

279
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Now the irony, from my perspective,

280
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me

281
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions

282
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
are religious demagogues of one form or another.

283
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions

284
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,820
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,

285
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes

286
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,820
and condition of human and animal well-being.

287
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
In fact, the endurance of religion

288
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,820
as a lens through which most people view moral questions

289
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
has separated most moral talk

290
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
from real questions of human and animal suffering.

291
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
This is why we spend our time

292
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
talking about things like gay marriage

293
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,820
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation

294
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,820
or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

295
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need

296
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
a universal conception of human values.

297
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Now, what stands in the way of this?

298
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, one thing to notice is that we

299
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
do something different when talking about morality --

300
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
especially secular, academic, scientist types.

301
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion

302
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.

303
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning

304
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
meditating on compassion,

305
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component

306
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
of human happiness.

307
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;

308
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping

309
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
and torturing and killing young women.

310
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion

311
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
about how to profitably use one's time.

312
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
(Laughter)

313
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Most Western intellectuals

314
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
look at this situation

315
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama

316
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
to be really right about -- really right about --

317
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about

318
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,820
that admits of a real argument

319
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
that potentially falls within the purview of science.

320
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.

321
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other

322
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
that should persuade the other."

323
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Notice that we don't do this in science.

324
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
On the left you have Edward Witten.

325
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
He's a string theorist.

326
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
If you ask the smartest physicists around

327
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
who is the smartest physicist around,

328
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.

329
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.

330
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
(Laughter)

331
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference

332
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
and said,"String theory is bogus.

333
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to

334
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
view the universe at a small scale.

335
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I'm not a fan."

336
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
(Laughter)

337
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;

338
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
I don't understand string theory.

339
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.

340
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
(Laughter)

341
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.

342
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
But this is just the point.

343
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
Whenever we are talking about facts

344
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
certain opinions must be excluded.

345
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.

346
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
That is what it is for knowledge to count.

347
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
How have we convinced ourselves

348
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,820
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,

349
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
or moral talent, or moral genius even?

350
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
How have we convinced ourselves

351
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
that every opinion has to count?

352
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
How have we convinced ourselves

353
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
that every culture has a point of view

354
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
on these subjects worth considering?

355
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Does the Taliban

356
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
have a point of view on physics

357
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
that is worth considering? No.

358
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,820
(Laughter)

359
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
How is their ignorance any less obvious

360
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
on the subject of human well-being?

361
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,820
(Applause)

362
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,820
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.

363
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
It needs people like ourselves to admit

364
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
that there are right and wrong answers

365
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
to questions of human flourishing,

366
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
and morality relates

367
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
to that domain of facts.

368
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
It is possible

369
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,820
for individuals, and even for whole cultures,

370
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
to care about the wrong things,

371
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
which is to say that it's possible for them

372
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead

373
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
to needless human suffering.

374
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.

375
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
We live in a world in which

376
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
the boundaries between nations mean less and less,

377
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
and they will one day mean nothing.

378
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
We live in a world filled with destructive technology,

379
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
and this technology cannot be uninvented;

380
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
it will always be easier

381
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
to break things than to fix them.

382
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious

383
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
that we can no more

384
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
respect and tolerate

385
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,820
vast differences in notions of human well-being

386
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
than we can respect or tolerate vast differences

387
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
in the notions about how disease spreads,

388
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,820
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.

389
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
We simply must converge

390
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,820
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

391
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,820
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.

392
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Thank you very much.

393
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:48,820
(Applause)

394
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.

395
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,

396
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
hearing some of this, may well be doing the

397
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,820
screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.

398
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Language seems to be really important here.

399
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
When you're talking about the veil,

400
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

401
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,820
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.

402
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
And some of them would say something else. They would say,

403
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
"No, you know, this is a celebration

404
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
of female specialness,

405
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --

406
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,820
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --

407
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
"that male lust is not to be trusted."

408
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
I mean, can you engage in a conversation

409
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,820
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?

410
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,

411
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
watching the clock ticking,

412
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
but the question is:

413
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
What is voluntary in a context

414
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
where men have certain expectations,

415
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,820
and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way

416
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
if you don't veil yourself?

417
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
And so, if anyone in this room

418
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
wanted to wear a veil,

419
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,820
or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --

420
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,820
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,

421
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
but we have to be honest about

422
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
the constraints that these women are placed under.

423
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,820
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager

424
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
to always take their word for it,

425
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
especially when it's 120 degrees out

426
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,820
and you're wearing a full burqa.

427
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this

428
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
concept of moral progress.

429
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
But can you reconcile that?

430
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
I think I understood you to say that you could

431
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
reconcile that with a world that doesn't become

432
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,820
one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.

433
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Paint your picture of what

434
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
rolling the clock 50 years forward,

435
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
100 years forward, how you would like to think of

436
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
the world, balancing moral progress

437
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,820
with richness.

438
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
SH: Well, I think once you admit

439
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,820
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds

440
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,820
at the level of the brain in some important detail,

441
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
then you have to admit

442
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,820
that we are going to understand all of the positive

443
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
and negative qualities

444
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
of ourselves in much greater detail.

445
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion

446
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
like empathy and compassion,

447
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
and we're going to understand the factors

448
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,

449
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
whether they're how people talk to one another,

450
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
whether they're economic systems,

451
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,820
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that

452
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
we are inevitably going to converge

453
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
on that fact space.

454
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.

455
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
It's not going to be like

456
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
veiling my daughter from birth

457
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,820
is just as good as teaching her

458
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,820
to be confident and well-educated

459
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,820
in the context of men who do desire women.

460
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,820
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know

461
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,820
that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --

462
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
but at a certain point

463
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,820
we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved

464
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
and actually interrogate them.

465
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Do people love their daughters

466
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,820
just as much in these systems?

467
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.

468
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,820
CA: And if the results come out that actually they do,

469
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,820
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment

470
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
on some of these issues?

471
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,

472
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
that you can love someone

473
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
in the context of a truly delusional belief system.

474
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son

475
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,820
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,

476
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,820
I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."

477
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
If you get all those parts aligned,

478
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,820
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.

479
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
But again, then we have to talk about

480
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
well-being in a larger context.

481
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
It's all of us in this together,

482
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,820
not one man feeling ecstasy

483
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
and then blowing himself up on a bus.

484
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to

485
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
continue for hours.

486
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.

487
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
SH: Really an honor. Thank you.

488
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,820
(Applause)
