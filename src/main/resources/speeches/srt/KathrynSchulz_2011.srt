1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
So it's 1995,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm in college,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
and a friend and I go on a road trip

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
from Providence, Rhode Island

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
to Portland, Oregon.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And you know, we're young and unemployed,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
so we do the whole thing on back roads

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
through state parks

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
and national forests --

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
basically the longest route we can possibly take.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
I turn to my friend

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
and I ask her a question

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that's been bothering me

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
for 2,000 miles.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,820
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
My friend looks at me totally blankly.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
There's actually a gentleman in the front row

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
(Laughter)

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And I'm like, "You know,

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
all the signs we keep seeing

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
with the Chinese character on them."

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
She just stares at me for a few moments,

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
and then she cracks up,

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
because she figures out what I'm talking about.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
And what I'm talking about is this.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,820
(Laughter)

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
(Laughter)

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,820
I've spent the last five years of my life

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
thinking about situations

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
exactly like this --

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
why we sometimes misunderstand

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
the signs around us,

36
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
and how we behave when that happens,

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,820
and what all of this can tell us about human nature.

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
In other words, as you heard Chris say,

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
I've spent the last five years

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
thinking about being wrong.

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
This might strike you as a strange career move,

42
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
but it actually has one great advantage:

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
no job competition.

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
(Laughter)

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
In fact, most of us do everything we can

46
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
to avoid thinking about being wrong,

47
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
that we ourselves are wrong.

49
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
We get it in the abstract.

50
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
But when it comes down to me, right now,

53
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
to all the beliefs I hold,

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
here in the present tense,

55
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,820
suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
goes out the window --

57
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.

59
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
We go to meetings in the present tense;

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
we go on family vacations in the present tense;

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,

63
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
trapped in this little bubble

64
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
of feeling very right about everything.

65
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
I think this is a problem.

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
in our personal and professional lives,

68
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
So what I want to do today

70
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
inside this feeling of being right.

72
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
And second, why it's such a problem.

73
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And finally, I want to convince you

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
that it is possible

75
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
to step outside of that feeling

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
and that if you can do so,

77
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
it is the single greatest

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.

79
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
So why do we get stuck

80
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
in this feeling of being right?

81
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
So let me ask you guys something --

83
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:

84
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
How does it feel -- emotionally --

85
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
how does it feel to be wrong?

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Dreadful. Thumbs down.

87
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --

89
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
thank you, these are great answers,

90
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,820
but they're answers to a different question.

91
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
You guys are answering the question:

92
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
How does it feel to realize you're wrong?

93
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
(Laughter)

94
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,

96
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
it can actually be quite funny,

97
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
like my stupid Chinese character mistake.

98
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
But just being wrong

99
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
doesn't feel like anything.

100
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I'll give you an analogy.

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon

102
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
where there's this pathetic coyote

103
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?

104
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,

105
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner

106
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,

107
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.

108
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,820
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.

109
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
And what's funny --

110
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
at least if you're six years old --

111
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
is that the coyote's totally fine too.

112
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
He just keeps running --

113
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
right up until the moment that he looks down

114
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
and realizes that he's in mid-air.

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
That's when he falls.

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
When we're wrong about something --

117
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
not when we realize it, but before that --

118
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
we're like that coyote

119
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.

120
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
You know, we're already wrong,

121
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
we're already in trouble,

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
but we feel like we're on solid ground.

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.

124
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
It does feel like something to be wrong;

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
it feels like being right.

126
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
(Laughter)

127
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
So this is one reason, a structural reason,

128
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.

129
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
I call this error blindness.

130
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Most of the time,

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
we don't have any kind of internal cue

132
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
to let us know that we're wrong about something,

133
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
until it's too late.

134
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --

135
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
and this one is cultural.

136
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Think back for a moment to elementary school.

137
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
You're sitting there in class,

138
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,

139
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and one of them looks like this.

140
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
This is not mine, by the way.

141
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
(Laughter)

142
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
So there you are in grade school,

143
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
and you know exactly what to think

144
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
about the kid who got this paper.

145
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,

146
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
the one who never does his homework.

147
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
So by the time you are nine years old,

148
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
you've already learned, first of all,

149
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
that people who get stuff wrong

150
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --

151
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
and second of all,

152
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
that the way to succeed in life

153
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
is to never make any mistakes.

154
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,820
We learn these really bad lessons really well.

155
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
And a lot of us --

156
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --

157
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
deal with them by just becoming

158
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
perfect little A students,

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
perfectionists, over-achievers.

160
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Right,

161
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?

162
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,820
(Laughter)

163
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,820
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.

164
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Okay, so fine.

165
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Except that then we freak out

166
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.

167
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Because according to this,

168
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
getting something wrong

169
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
means there's something wrong with us.

170
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
So we just insist that we're right,

171
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
because it makes us feel smart and responsible

172
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
and virtuous and safe.

173
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
So let me tell you a story.

174
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
A couple of years ago,

175
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.

176
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Beth Israel's in Boston.

177
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --

178
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
one of the best hospitals in the country.

179
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.

180
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --

181
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.

182
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Everything seems to have gone fine.

183
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,

184
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"

185
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages

186
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
because the surgeon has performed a major operation

187
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
on her left leg instead of her right one.

188
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel

189
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
spoke about this incident,

190
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
he said something very interesting.

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
He said, "For whatever reason,

192
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
the surgeon simply felt

193
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
that he was on the correct side of the patient."

194
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
(Laughter)

195
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
The point of this story

196
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
is that trusting too much in the feeling

197
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
of being on the correct side of anything

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
can be very dangerous.

199
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
This internal sense of rightness

200
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
that we all experience so often

201
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
is not a reliable guide

202
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
to what is actually going on in the external world.

203
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
And when we act like it is,

204
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,820
and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,

205
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
well that's when we end up doing things

206
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,820
like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

207
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
or torpedoing the global economy.

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
So this is a huge practical problem.

209
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
But it's also a huge social problem.

210
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.

211
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
It means that you think that your beliefs

212
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
just perfectly reflect reality.

213
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
And when you feel that way,

214
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
you've got a problem to solve,

215
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
which is, how are you going to explain

216
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
all of those people who disagree with you?

217
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,

218
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.

219
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us

220
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
is we just assume they're ignorant.

221
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
They don't have access to the same information that we do,

222
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
and when we generously share that information with them,

223
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.

224
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
When that doesn't work,

225
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do

226
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
and they still disagree with us,

227
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
then we move on to a second assumption,

228
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
which is that they're idiots.

229
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
(Laughter)

230
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,

231
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.

232
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
And when that doesn't work,

233
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
when it turns out that people who disagree with us

234
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
have all the same facts we do

235
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
and are actually pretty smart,

236
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
then we move on to a third assumption:

237
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
they know the truth,

238
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
and they are deliberately distorting it

239
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
for their own malevolent purposes.

240
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
So this is a catastrophe.

241
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
This attachment to our own rightness

242
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
keeps us from preventing mistakes

243
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
when we absolutely need to

244
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
and causes us to treat each other terribly.

245
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
But to me, what's most baffling

246
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
and most tragic about this

247
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
is that it misses the whole point of being human.

248
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
It's like we want to imagine

249
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows

250
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
and we just gaze out of them

251
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
and describe the world as it unfolds.

252
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window

253
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
and see the exact same thing.

254
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
That is not true,

255
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.

256
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
The miracle of your mind

257
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
isn't that you can see the world as it is.

258
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.

259
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
We can remember the past,

260
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
and we can think about the future,

261
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
and we can imagine what it's like

262
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
to be some other person in some other place.

263
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
And we all do this a little differently,

264
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
which is why we can all look up at the same night sky

265
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
and see this

266
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
and also this

267
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
and also this.

268
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.

269
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing

270
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
about "I think therefore I am,"

271
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
this guy, St. Augustine, sat down

272
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --

273
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,820
"I err therefore I am."

274
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Augustine understood

275
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
that our capacity to screw up,

276
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
it's not some kind of embarrassing defect

277
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
in the human system,

278
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
something we can eradicate or overcome.

279
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
It's totally fundamental to who we are.

280
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Because, unlike God,

281
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
we don't really know what's going on out there.

282
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
And unlike all of the other animals,

283
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.

284
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
To me, this obsession

285
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
is the source and root

286
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
of all of our productivity and creativity.

287
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Last year, for various reasons,

288
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I found myself listening to a lot of episodes

289
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
of the Public Radio show This American Life.

290
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
And so I'm listening and I'm listening,

291
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
and at some point, I start feeling

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
like all the stories are about being wrong.

293
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
And my first thought was,

294
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
"I've lost it.

295
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.

296
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I just imagined it everywhere,"

297
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
which has happened.

298
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
But a couple of months later,

299
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.

300
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
And I mentioned this to him,

301
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
and he was like, "No actually, that's true.

302
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
In fact," he says,

303
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
"as a staff, we joke

304
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
that every single episode of our show

305
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
has the same crypto-theme.

306
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And the crypto-theme is:

307
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
'I thought this one thing was going to happen

308
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
and something else happened instead.'

309
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.

310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
We need these moments

311
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
of surprise and reversal and wrongness

312
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
to make these stories work."

313
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
And for the rest of us, audience members,

314
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
as listeners, as readers,

315
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
we eat this stuff up.

316
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
We love things like plot twists

317
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
and red herrings and surprise endings.

318
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
When it comes to our stories,

319
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
we love being wrong.

320
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
But, you know, our stories are like this

321
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
because our lives are like this.

322
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
We think this one thing is going to happen

323
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
and something else happens instead.

324
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,

325
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,

326
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.

327
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
And something else happened instead.

328
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
And Hosni Mubarak

329
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,

330
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
until he got too old or too sick

331
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.

332
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
And something else happened instead.

333
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
And maybe you thought

334
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart

335
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.

336
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
And something else happened instead.

337
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
And I have to tell you

338
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book

339
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
about a subject everybody hates

340
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
for an audience that would never materialize.

341
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
And something else happened instead.

342
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
(Laughter)

343
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
I mean, this is life.

344
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
For good and for ill,

345
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
we generate these incredible stories

346
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
about the world around us,

347
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
and then the world turns around and astonishes us.

348
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
No offense, but this entire conference

349
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
is an unbelievable monument

350
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
to our capacity to get stuff wrong.

351
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
We just spent an entire week

352
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
talking about innovations and advancements

353
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and improvements,

354
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
but you know why we need all of those innovations

355
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
and advancements and improvements?

356
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Because half the stuff

357
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --

358
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
TED 1998 --

359
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
eh.

360
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,820
(Laughter)

361
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Didn't really work out that way, did it?

362
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
(Laughter)

363
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Where's my jet pack, Chris?

364
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,820
(Laughter)

365
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,820
(Applause)

366
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
So here we are again.

367
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
And that's how it goes.

368
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
We come up with another idea.

369
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
We tell another story.

370
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,820
We hold another conference.

371
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The theme of this one,

372
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
as you guys have now heard seven million times,

373
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
is the rediscovery of wonder.

374
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
And to me,

375
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
if you really want to rediscover wonder,

376
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
you need to step outside

377
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,820
of that tiny, terrified space of rightness

378
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
and look around at each other

379
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
and look out at the vastness

380
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
and complexity and mystery

381
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
of the universe

382
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
and be able to say,

383
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
"Wow, I don't know.

384
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Maybe I'm wrong."

385
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Thank you.

386
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
(Applause)

387
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Thank you guys.

388
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
(Applause)
