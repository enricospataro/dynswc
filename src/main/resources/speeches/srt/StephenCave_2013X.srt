1
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:14,091
I have a question:

2
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,468
Who here remembers when they first realized

3
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:20,891
they were going to die?

4
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,393
I do. I was a young boy,

5
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:26,448
and my grandfather had just died,

6
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:30,366
and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night

7
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:34,000
trying to make sense of what had happened.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,635
What did it mean that he was dead?

9
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,419
Where had he gone?

10
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:41,841
It was like a hole in reality had opened up

11
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,976
and swallowed him.

12
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:46,778
But then the really shocking
question occurred to me:

13
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:50,268
If he could die, could it happen to me too?

14
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:53,567
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?

15
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,357
Would it open up beneath my bed

16
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:58,591
and swallow me as I slept?

17
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,779
Well, at some point, all children
become aware of death.

18
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,684
It can happen in different ways, of course,

19
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,517
and usually comes in stages.

20
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:10,030
Our idea of death develops as we grow older.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,759
And if you reach back into the dark corners

22
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,456
of your memory,

23
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:17,459
you might remember something like what I felt

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,714
when my grandfather died and when I realized

25
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,664
it could happen to me too,

26
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:25,243
that sense that behind all of this

27
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:28,580
the void is waiting.

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,857
And this development in childhood

29
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,678
reflects the development of our species.

30
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:36,993
Just as there was a point in your development

31
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:40,519
as a child when your sense of self and of time

32
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,618
became sophisticated enough

33
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:46,540
for you to realize you were mortal,

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,246
so at some point in the evolution of our species,

35
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:53,261
some early human's sense of self and of time

36
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:55,504
became sophisticated enough

37
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:58,619
for them to become the first human to realize,

38
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,052
"I'm going to die."

39
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:04,271
This is, if you like, our curse.

40
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:08,314
It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.

41
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,413
We have to live in the knowledge

42
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,074
that the worst thing that can possibly happen

43
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:14,698
one day surely will,

44
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,204
the end of all our projects,

45
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:19,668
our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.

46
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,849
We each live in the shadow of a personal

47
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,838
apocalypse.

48
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:27,342
And that's frightening. It's terrifying.

49
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,802
And so we look for a way out.

50
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:33,083
And in my case, as I was about five years old,

51
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,078
this meant asking my mum.

52
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:38,540
Now when I first started asking

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,321
what happens when we die,

54
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,413
the grown-ups around me at the time

55
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,616
answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness

56
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,603
and half-hearted Christianity,

57
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,547
and the phrase I heard most often

58
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,106
was that granddad was now

59
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,570
"up there looking down on us,"

60
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,535
and if I should die too, which
wouldn't happen of course,

61
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:00,331
then I too would go up there,

62
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,381
which made death sound a lot like

63
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,035
an existential elevator.

64
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:08,153
Now this didn't sound very plausible.

65
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:11,056
I used to watch a children's
news program at the time,

66
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,496
and this was the era of space exploration.

67
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,670
There were always rockets going up into the sky,

68
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,366
up into space, going up there.

69
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,695
But none of the astronauts when they came back

70
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:23,927
ever mentioned having met my granddad

71
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,386
or any other dead people.

72
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,689
But I was scared,

73
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,129
and the idea of taking the existential elevator

74
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,735
to see my granddad

75
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,150
sounded a lot better than being swallowed

76
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,221
by the void while I slept.

77
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,490
And so I believed it anyway,

78
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,161
even though it didn't make much sense.

79
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,403
And this thought process that I went through

80
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,934
as a child, and have been through many times since,

81
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,844
including as a grown-up,

82
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,291
is a product of what psychologists call

83
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,755
a bias.

84
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:55,029
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically

85
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,747
get things wrong,

86
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:59,431
ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,

87
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:03,020
distort reality, or see what we want to see,

88
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,252
and the bias I'm talking about

89
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,690
works like this:

90
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,925
Confront someone with the fact

91
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,472
that they are going to die

92
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:13,505
and they will believe just about any story

93
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,363
that tells them it isn't true

94
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,777
and they can, instead, live forever,

95
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:21,862
even if it means taking the existential elevator.

96
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:26,290
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.

97
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,165
It has been demonstrated in over 400

98
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,846
empirical studies.

99
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:33,355
Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.

100
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,290
They work like this.

101
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,780
You take two groups of people

102
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,563
who are similar in all relevant respects,

103
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:42,252
and you remind one group that they're going to die

104
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,881
but not the other, then you compare their behavior.

105
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,754
So you're observing how it biases behavior

106
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:52,508
when people become aware of their mortality.

107
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,420
And every time, you get the same result:

108
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,507
People who are made aware of their mortality

109
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,518
are more willing to believe stories

110
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,381
that tell them they can escape death

111
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,153
and live forever.

112
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,442
So here's an example: One recent study

113
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,212
took two groups of agnostics,

114
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:10,808
that is people who are undecided

115
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,323
in their religious beliefs.

116
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:16,907
Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.

117
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,552
The other group was asked to think about

118
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,385
being lonely.

119
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:23,201
They were then asked again
about their religious beliefs.

120
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,065
Those who had been asked
to think about being dead

121
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,638
were afterwards twice as likely to express faith

122
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,298
in God and Jesus.

123
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,076
Twice as likely.

124
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,784
Even though the before they
were all equally agnostic.

125
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,545
But put the fear of death in them,

126
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,404
and they run to Jesus.

127
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:44,916
Now, this shows that reminding people of death

128
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:48,161
biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,

129
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,186
and it works not just for religion,

130
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:52,423
but for any kind of belief system

131
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:55,883
that promises immortality in some form,

132
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,688
whether it's becoming famous

133
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,102
or having children

134
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,449
or even nationalism,

135
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,722
which promises you can live
on as part of a greater whole.

136
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:05,653
This is a bias that has shaped

137
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:08,992
the course of human history.

138
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:11,259
Now, the theory behind this bias

139
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,996
in the over 400 studies

140
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:15,125
is called terror management theory,

141
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,475
and the idea is simple. It's just this.

142
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:20,024
We develop our worldviews,

143
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,181
that is, the stories we tell ourselves

144
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,917
about the world and our place in it,

145
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,199
in order to help us manage

146
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,113
the terror of death.

147
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:31,912
And these immortality stories

148
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,909
have thousands of different manifestations,

149
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,493
but I believe that behind the apparent diversity

150
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,192
there are actually just four basic forms

151
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,703
that these immortality stories can take.

152
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,508
And we can see them repeating themselves

153
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,678
throughout history, just with slight variations

154
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,443
to reflect the vocabulary of the day.

155
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,951
Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four

156
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,204
basic forms of immortality story,

157
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:58,774
and I want to try to give you some sense

158
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:01,087
of the way in which they're retold by each culture

159
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,854
or generation

160
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,026
using the vocabulary of their day.

161
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,665
Now, the first story is the simplest.

162
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,818
We want to avoid death,

163
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,243
and the dream of doing that in this body

164
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,603
in this world forever

165
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:16,894
is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,

166
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,353
and it might at first sound implausible,

167
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:23,334
but actually, almost every culture in human history

168
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,396
has had some myth or legend

169
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,157
of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth

170
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,136
or something that promises to keep us going

171
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:34,273
forever.

172
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,866
Ancient Egypt had such myths,

173
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,234
ancient Babylon, ancient India.

174
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:41,086
Throughout European history, we find them
in the work of the alchemists,

175
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,880
and of course we still believe this today,

176
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,443
only we tell this story using the vocabulary

177
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,099
of science.

178
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,705
So 100 years ago,

179
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,524
hormones had just been discovered,

180
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,176
and people hoped that hormone treatments

181
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:55,875
were going to cure aging and disease,

182
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,728
and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,

183
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,023
genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.

184
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,981
But the idea that science can cure death

185
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:07,322
is just one more chapter in the story

186
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:09,555
of the magical elixir,

187
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:13,991
a story that is as old as civilization.

188
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,771
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir

189
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,174
and staying alive forever

190
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,975
is a risky strategy.

191
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,215
When we look back through history

192
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,999
at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,

193
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,828
the one thing they now have in common

194
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:29,458
is that they're all dead.

195
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,196
So we need a backup plan,
and exactly this kind of plan B

196
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:36,767
is what the second kind of immortality story offers,

197
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,522
and that's resurrection.

198
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,896
And it stays with the idea that I am this body,

199
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,871
I am this physical organism.

200
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:45,039
It accepts that I'm going to have to die

201
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,413
but says, despite that,

202
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:48,916
I can rise up and I can live again.

203
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,534
In other words, I can do what Jesus did.

204
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,579
Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],

205
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,690
and then he rose up and lived again.

206
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,809
And the idea that we can all be
resurrected to live again

207
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,097
is orthodox believe, not just for Christians

208
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:04,800
but also Jews and Muslims.

209
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,964
But our desire to believe this story

210
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,974
is so deeply embedded

211
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,072
that we are reinventing it again

212
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,564
for the scientific age,

213
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:15,387
for example, with the idea of cryonics.

214
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,977
That's the idea that when you die,

215
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,976
you can have yourself frozen,

216
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,365
and then, at some point when technology

217
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:22,576
has advanced enough,

218
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:24,696
you can be thawed out and repaired and revived

219
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,985
and so resurrected.

220
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:28,833
And so some people believe an omnipotent god

221
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,712
will resurrect them to live again,

222
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:34,855
and other people believe an 
omnipotent scientist will do it.

223
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,569
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,

224
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,572
of climbing out of the grave,

225
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,291
it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.

226
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,082
They find the body too messy, too unreliable

227
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,230
to guarantee eternal life,

228
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,321
and so they set their hopes on the third,

229
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,438
more spiritual immortality story,

230
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,774
the idea that we can leave our body behind

231
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,071
and live on as a soul.

232
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,060
Now, the majority of people on Earth

233
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,833
believe they have a soul,

234
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,243
and the idea is central to many religions.

235
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,557
But even though, in its current form,

236
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:07,472
in its traditional form,

237
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:09,635
the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,

238
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,067
nonetheless we are again

239
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,291
reinventing it for the digital age,

240
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,768
for example with the idea

241
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,758
that you can leave your body behind

242
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,004
by uploading your mind, your essence,

243
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,960
the real you, onto a computer,

244
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,572
and so live on as an avatar in the ether.

245
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,595
But of course there are skeptics who say

246
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,439
if we look at the evidence of science,

247
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,083
particularly neuroscience,

248
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,912
it suggests that your mind,

249
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:34,492
your essence, the real you,

250
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:36,905
is very much dependent on a particular part

251
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:39,126
of your body, that is, your brain.

252
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,647
And such skeptics can find comfort

253
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,905
in the fourth kind of immortality story,

254
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:46,262
and that is legacy,

255
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:47,742
the idea that you can live on

256
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,993
through the echo you leave in the world,

257
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:52,342
like the great Greek warrior Achilles,

258
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,971
who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy

259
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:58,024
so that he might win immortal fame.

260
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,290
And the pursuit of fame is as widespread

261
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,431
and popular now as it ever was,

262
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,010
and in our digital age,

263
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,538
it's even easier to achieve.

264
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,862
You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles

265
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,555
or a great king or hero.

266
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:14,378
All you need is an Internet connection
and a funny cat. (Laughter)

267
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,841
But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,

268
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:19,685
biological legacy -- children, for example.

269
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,961
Or they like, they hope, to live on

270
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,678
as part of some greater whole,

271
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,127
a nation or a family or a tribe,

272
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,593
their gene pool.

273
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,106
But again, there are skeptics

274
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,819
who doubt whether legacy

275
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:33,794
really is immortality.

276
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,871
Woody Allen, for example, who said,

277
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,367
"I don't want to live on in
the hearts of my countrymen.

278
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,564
I want to live on in my apartment."

279
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,331
So those are the four

280
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,514
basic kinds of immortality stories,

281
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,156
and I've tried to give just some sense

282
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,449
of how they're retold by each generation

283
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,036
with just slight variations

284
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,341
to fit the fashions of the day.

285
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:55,830
And the fact that they recur in this way,

286
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,818
in such a similar form but
in such different belief systems,

287
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,396
suggests, I think,

288
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:02,798
that we should be skeptical of the truth

289
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:06,559
of any particular version of these stories.

290
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,670
The fact that some people believe

291
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,335
an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again

292
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:15,036
and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it

293
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:18,074
suggests that neither are really believing this

294
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,744
on the strength of the evidence.

295
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:23,170
Rather, we believe these stories

296
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,153
because we are biased to believe them,

297
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,981
and we are biased to believe them

298
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:31,251
because we are so afraid of death.

299
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,306
So the question is,

300
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,778
are we doomed to lead the one life we have

301
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,471
in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,

302
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:43,546
or can we overcome this bias?

303
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:46,013
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus

304
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,741
thought we could.

305
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:51,289
He argued that the fear of death is natural,

306
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,704
but it is not rational.

307
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:56,362
"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,

308
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:59,212
because when we are here, death is not,

309
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,965
and when death is here, we are gone."

310
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,763
Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult

311
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,085
to really grasp, to really internalize,

312
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,248
because exactly this idea of being gone

313
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,387
is so difficult to imagine.

314
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,618
So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,

315
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:17,075
Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:

316
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:20,019
"Death is not an event in life:

317
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,661
We do not live to experience death.

318
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,855
And so," he added,

319
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:27,790
"in this sense, life has no end."

320
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,966
So it was natural for me as a child

321
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,333
to fear being swallowed by the void,

322
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,212
but it wasn't rational,

323
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,197
because being swallowed by the void

324
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:39,275
is not something that any of us

325
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:42,545
will ever live to experience.

326
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:45,074
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because

327
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,033
the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,

328
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:52,515
yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,

329
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,645
and when we bring out into the open

330
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:57,343
the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,

331
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,194
then we can at least start

332
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,828
to try to minimize the influence it has

333
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:03,711
on our lives.

334
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:06,529
Now, I find it helps to see life

335
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,373
as being like a book:

336
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,841
Just as a book is bounded by its covers,

337
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,118
by beginning and end,

338
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,856
so our lives are bounded by birth and death,

339
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,371
and even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

340
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,507
it can encompass distant landscapes,

341
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:24,737
exotic figures, fantastic adventures.

342
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:28,086
And even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

343
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:29,909
the characters within it

344
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,751
know no horizons.

345
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:35,908
They only know the moments
that make up their story,

346
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,848
even when the book is closed.

347
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,984
And so the characters of a book

348
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:44,466
are not afraid of reaching the last page.

349
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,744
Long John Silver is not afraid of you

350
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:49,579
finishing your copy of "Treasure Island."

351
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,279
And so it should be with us.

352
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,423
Imagine the book of your life,

353
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:56,207
its covers, its beginning and end,
and your birth and your death.

354
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,384
You can only know the moments in between,

355
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,319
the moments that make up your life.

356
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,266
It makes no sense for you to fear

357
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,356
what is outside of those covers,

358
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,826
whether before your birth

359
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,802
or after your death.

360
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,331
And you needn't worry how long the book is,

361
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:13,804
or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.

362
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:15,346
The only thing that matters

363
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,844
is that you make it a good story.

364
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:21,064
Thank you.

365
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:25,249
(Applause)
