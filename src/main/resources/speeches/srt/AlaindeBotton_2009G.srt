1
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:14,804
For me they normally happen,
these career crises,

2
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,375
often, actually, on a Sunday evening,

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,272
just as the sun is starting to set,

4
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:23,954
and the gap between my hopes for myself
and the reality of my life

5
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:25,796
starts to diverge so painfully

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,796
that I normally end up
weeping into a pillow.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,325
I'm mentioning all this --

8
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:34,032
I'm mentioning all this because I think
this is not merely a personal problem;

9
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:35,592
you may think I'm wrong in this,

10
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:39,199
but I think we live in an age
when our lives are regularly punctuated

11
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:42,365
by career crises, by moments
when what we thought we knew --

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,199
about our lives, about our careers --

13
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:47,652
comes into contact
with a threatening sort of reality.

14
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:51,429
It's perhaps easier now than ever before
to make a good living.

15
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,796
It's perhaps harder than ever before

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,796
to stay calm, to be free
of career anxiety.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,209
I want to look now, if I may,
at some of the reasons

18
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:03,796
why we might be feeling
anxiety about our careers.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,059
Why we might be victims
of these career crises,

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:10,029
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.

21
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,796
One of the reasons
why we might be suffering

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,378
is that we are surrounded by snobs.

23
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,796
In a way, I've got some bad news,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,582
particularly to anybody
who's come to Oxford from abroad.

25
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,384
There's a real problem with snobbery,

26
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,574
because sometimes people
from outside the U.K.

27
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:27,305
imagine that snobbery
is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,

28
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,796
fixated on country houses and titles.

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,484
The bad news is that's not true.

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,484
Snobbery is a global phenomenon;
we are a global organization,

31
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:35,865
this is a global phenomenon.

32
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,524
What is a snob?

33
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:40,857
A snob is anybody who takes
a small part of you,

34
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,246
and uses that to come
to a complete vision of who you are.

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,796
That is snobbery.

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,145
The dominant kind of snobbery
that exists nowadays is job snobbery.

37
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:53,416
You encounter it within minutes
at a party, when you get asked

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,607
that famous iconic question
of the early 21st century,

39
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,804
"What do you do?"

40
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,829
According to how you answer that question,

41
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,187
people are either incredibly
delighted to see you,

42
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:04,393
or look at their watch
and make their excuses.

43
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,433
(Laughter)

44
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,796
Now, the opposite of a snob
is your mother.

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,796
(Laughter)

46
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,797
Not necessarily your mother,
or indeed mine,

47
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,456
but, as it were, the ideal mother,

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,828
somebody who doesn't care
about your achievements.

49
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:19,050
Unfortunately, most people
are not our mothers.

50
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,892
Most people make a strict correlation
between how much time,

51
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,309
and if you like, love --

52
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,796
not romantic love,
though that may be something --

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,115
but love in general, respect --
they are willing to accord us,

54
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,796
that will be strictly defined
by our position in the social hierarchy.

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,059
And that's a lot of the reason
why we care so much about our careers

56
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,796
and indeed start caring
so much about material goods.

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,059
You know, we're often told
that we live in very materialistic times,

58
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,796
that we're all greedy people.

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,106
I don't think we are
particularly materialistic.

60
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,558
I think we live in a society which has
simply pegged certain emotional rewards

61
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,794
to the acquisition of material goods.

62
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:56,748
It's not the material goods we want;
it's the rewards we want.

63
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,780
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.

64
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,765
The next time you see somebody
driving a Ferrari, don't think,

65
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,613
"This is somebody who's greedy."

66
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:07,355
Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly
vulnerable and in need of love."

67
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,796
(Laughter)

68
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,223
Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.

69
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:14,755
There are other reasons --

70
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,796
(Laughter)

71
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,742
There are other reasons why it's perhaps
harder now to feel calm than ever before.

72
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,442
One of these, and it's paradoxical,

73
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:23,976
because it's linked to something
that's rather nice,

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,046
is the hope we all have for our careers.

75
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,168
Never before have
expectations been so high

76
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,915
about what human beings can
achieve with their lifespan.

77
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,968
We're told, from many sources,
that anyone can achieve anything.

78
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:35,875
We've done away with the caste system,

79
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,590
we are now in a system where anyone
can rise to any position they please.

80
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:41,796
And it's a beautiful idea.

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,273
Along with that is a kind
of spirit of equality;

82
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:45,654
we're all basically equal.

83
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:49,796
There are no strictly-defined hierarchies.

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,282
There is one really big problem with this,

85
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:53,814
and that problem is envy.

86
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:56,602
Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,

87
00:03:56,626 --> 00:04:00,106
but if there's one dominant emotion
in modern society, that is envy.

88
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,797
And it's linked to the spirit of equality.

89
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:03,972
Let me explain.

90
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:07,257
I think it would be very unusual
for anyone here, or anyone watching,

91
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,153
to be envious of the Queen of England.

92
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:12,414
Even though she is much richer
than any of you are,

93
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:14,700
and she's got a very large house,

94
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:18,382
the reason why we don't envy her
is because she's too weird.

95
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,414
(Laughter)

96
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:20,795
She's simply too strange.

97
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,200
We can't relate to her,
she speaks in a funny way,

98
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:24,597
she comes from an odd place.

99
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,994
So we can't relate to her,

100
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,916
and when you can't relate
to somebody, you don't envy them.

101
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,796
The closer two people are --
in age, in background,

102
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,138
in the process of identification --
the more there's a danger of envy,

103
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:38,637
which is incidentally why none of you
should ever go to a school reunion,

104
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:42,760
because there is no stronger reference
point than people one was at school with.

105
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:46,322
The problem of modern society is
it turns the whole world into a school.

106
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,616
Everybody's wearing jeans,
everybody's the same.

107
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,795
And yet, they're not.

108
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,796
So there's a spirit of equality
combined with deep inequality,

109
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,511
which can make for
a very stressful situation.

110
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,860
It's probably as unlikely
that you would nowadays

111
00:04:57,884 --> 00:04:59,796
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,

112
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,796
as it was unlikely in the 17th century

113
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,062
that you would accede to the ranks
of the French aristocracy.

114
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,134
But the point is,
it doesn't feel that way.

115
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:10,224
It's made to feel, by magazines
and other media outlets,

116
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:14,104
that if you've got energy, a few bright
ideas about technology, a garage --

117
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,559
you, too, could start a major thing.

118
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,938
(Laughter)

119
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:21,201
The consequences of this problem
make themselves felt in bookshops.

120
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:24,416
When you go to a large bookshop
and look at the self-help sections,

121
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,620
as I sometimes do --

122
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,730
if you analyze self-help books
produced in the world today,

123
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,201
there are basically two kinds.

124
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:34,011
The first kind tells you, "You can do it!
You can make it! Anything's possible!"

125
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:38,631
The other kind tells you how to cope with
what we politely call "low self-esteem,"

126
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:41,282
or impolitely call,
"feeling very bad about yourself."

127
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,796
There's a real correlation

128
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,796
between a society that tells people
that they can do anything,

129
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,796
and the existence of low self-esteem.

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,796
So that's another way in which something
quite positive can have a nasty kickback.

131
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,145
There is another reason why
we might be feeling more anxious --

132
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,796
about our careers, about our status
in the world today, than ever before.

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,868
And it's, again, linked to something nice.

134
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:04,590
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.

135
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,916
Everybody, all politicians
on Left and Right,

136
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,157
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,

137
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:13,327
and we should all be trying to make
our societies really, really meritocratic.

138
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,670
In other words --
what is a meritocratic society?

139
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:20,820
A meritocratic society is one in which,
if you've got talent and energy and skill,

140
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:23,416
you will get to the top,
nothing should hold you back.

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,602
It's a beautiful idea.

142
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:27,950
The problem is, if you
really believe in a society

143
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,642
where those who merit to get
to the top, get to the top,

144
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,671
you'll also, by implication,
and in a far more nasty way,

145
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:37,392
believe in a society where those
who deserve to get to the bottom

146
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,639
also get to the bottom and stay there.

147
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:43,011
In other words, your position in life
comes to seem not accidental,

148
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,796
but merited and deserved.

149
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,796
And that makes failure
seem much more crushing.

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,198
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,

151
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,094
when you met a very poor person,

152
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:54,982
that person would be described
as an "unfortunate" --

153
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:58,796
literally, somebody who had not
been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,916
Nowadays, particularly
in the United States,

155
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,083
if you meet someone
at the bottom of society,

156
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,796
they may unkindly be
described as a "loser."

157
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,796
There's a real difference
between an unfortunate and a loser,

158
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,796
and that shows 400 years
of evolution in society

159
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,917
and our belief in who
is responsible for our lives.

160
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,796
It's no longer the gods, it's us.
We're in the driving seat.

161
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,796
That's exhilarating if you're doing well,

162
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,672
and very crushing if you're not.

163
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,238
It leads, in the worst cases --

164
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:26,229
in the analysis of a sociologist
like Emil Durkheim --

165
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:28,560
it leads to increased rates of suicide.

166
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,796
There are more suicides
in developed, individualistic countries

167
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,561
than in any other part of the world.

168
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,159
And some of the reason for that

169
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:38,252
is that people take what happens to them
extremely personally --

170
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:41,795
they own their success,
but they also own their failure.

171
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,106
Is there any relief
from some of these pressures

172
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,467
that I've been outlining?

173
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,650
I think there is.

174
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,440
I just want to turn to a few of them.

175
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:49,796
Let's take meritocracy.

176
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,796
This idea that everybody deserves
to get where they get to,

177
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,628
I think it's a crazy idea,
completely crazy.

178
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,904
I will support any politician
of Left and Right,

179
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,222
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;

180
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,796
I am a meritocrat in that sense.

181
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,492
But I think it's insane to believe

182
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,973
that we will ever make a society
that is genuinely meritocratic;

183
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:08,231
it's an impossible dream.

184
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,716
The idea that we will make a society
where literally everybody is graded,

185
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,636
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,

186
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,796
exactly done as it
should be, is impossible.

187
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,796
There are simply too many random factors:

188
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,796
accidents, accidents of birth,

189
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
accidents of things dropping
on people's heads, illnesses, etc.

190
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,796
We will never get to grade them,

191
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,796
never get to grade people as they should.

192
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,963
I'm drawn to a lovely quote
by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"

193
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:34,400
where he says, "It's a sin
to judge any man by his post."

194
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:36,066
In modern English that would mean

195
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,814
it's a sin to come to any view
of who you should talk to,

196
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,421
dependent on their business card.

197
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,196
It's not the post that should count.

198
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,000
According to St. Augustine, only God
can really put everybody in their place;

199
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,159
he's going to do that
on the Day of Judgment,

200
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:50,565
with angels and trumpets,
and the skies will open.

201
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,096
Insane idea, if you're
a secularist person, like me.

202
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,740
But something very valuable
in that idea, nevertheless.

203
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:59,096
In other words, hold your horses
when you're coming to judge people.

204
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,796
You don't necessarily know
what someone's true value is.

205
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,796
That is an unknown part of them,

206
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,015
and we shouldn't behave
as though it is known.

207
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,840
There is another source of solace
and comfort for all this.

208
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,989
When we think about failing in life,
when we think about failure,

209
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:14,855
one of the reasons why we fear failing

210
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,154
is not just a loss of income,
a loss of status.

211
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:19,921
What we fear is the judgment
and ridicule of others.

212
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,098
And it exists.

213
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,678
The number one organ of ridicule,
nowadays, is the newspaper.

214
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,891
If you open the newspaper
any day of the week,

215
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,231
it's full of people
who've messed up their lives.

216
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,248
They've slept with the wrong person,
taken the wrong substance,

217
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,294
passed the wrong piece of legislation --

218
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:36,486
whatever it is, and then
are fit for ridicule.

219
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,795
In other words, they have failed.
And they are described as "losers."

220
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,647
Now, is there any alternative to this?

221
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:46,267
I think the Western tradition shows us one
glorious alternative, which is tragedy.

222
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,513
Tragic art, as it developed
in the theaters of ancient Greece,

223
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:52,307
in the fifth century B.C.,
was essentially an art form

224
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,796
devoted to tracing how people fail,

225
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,203
and also according them
a level of sympathy,

226
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,503
which ordinary life would not
necessarily accord them.

227
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,567
A few years ago,
I was thinking about this,

228
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,186
and I went to "The Sunday Sport,"

229
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,820
a tabloid newspaper I don't
recommend you start reading

230
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,741
if you're not familiar with it already.

231
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:11,773
(Laughter)

232
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:13,039
And I went to talk to them

233
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:15,804
about certain of the great
tragedies of Western art.

234
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:19,413
I wanted to see how they would seize
the bare bones of certain stories,

235
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:23,397
if they came in as a news item
at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.

236
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:26,545
I mentioned Othello; they'd not
heard of it but were fascinated.

237
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:27,577
(Laughter)

238
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,903
I asked them to write
a headline for the story.

239
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,366
They came up with "Love-Crazed
Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."

240
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,796
Splashed across the headline.

241
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.

242
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,035
Again, a book they were
enchanted to discover.

243
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,796
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress
Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."

244
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,836
(Laughter)

245
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,043
And then my favorite --

246
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,146
they really do have a kind of genius
of their own, these guys --

247
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,264
my favorite is Sophocles'
Oedipus the King:

248
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:53,796
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,796
(Laughter)

250
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,796
(Applause)

251
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,796
In a way, if you like, at one end
of the spectrum of sympathy,

252
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,613
you've got the tabloid newspaper.

253
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,828
At the other end of the spectrum,
you've got tragedy and tragic art.

254
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,626
And I suppose I'm arguing
that we should learn a little bit

255
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,436
about what's happening in tragic art.

256
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,158
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.

257
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,493
He is not a loser, though he has lost.

258
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,154
And I think that is the message
of tragedy to us,

259
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,796
and why it's so very,
very important, I think.

260
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,796
The other thing about modern society
and why it causes this anxiety,

261
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,796
is that we have nothing at its center
that is non-human.

262
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,408
We are the first society
to be living in a world

263
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,924
where we don't worship
anything other than ourselves.

264
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,393
We think very highly of ourselves,
and so we should;

265
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,710
we've put people on the Moon,
done all sorts of extraordinary things.

266
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:43,027
And so we tend to worship ourselves.
Our heroes are human heroes.

267
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,614
That's a very new situation.

268
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,145
Most other societies have had,
right at their center,

269
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,590
the worship of something transcendent:
a god, a spirit, a natural force,

270
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,964
the universe, whatever it is --
something else that is being worshiped.

271
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,060
We've slightly lost
the habit of doing that,

272
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,852
which is, I think, why we're
particularly drawn to nature.

273
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:02,132
Not for the sake of our health,
though it's often presented that way,

274
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,796
but because it's an escape
from the human anthill.

275
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,796
It's an escape from our own competition,

276
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,796
and our own dramas.

277
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,440
And that's why we enjoy looking
at glaciers and oceans,

278
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,415
and contemplating the Earth
from outside its perimeters, etc.

279
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:19,018
We like to feel in contact
with something that is non-human,

280
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,796
and that is so deeply important to us.

281
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,011
What I think I've been talking
about really is success and failure.

282
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:28,464
And one of the interesting
things about success

283
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:30,472
is that we think we know what it means.

284
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,893
If I said that there's somebody
behind the screen who's very successful,

285
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,294
certain ideas would
immediately come to mind.

286
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:38,968
You'd think that person
might have made a lot of money,

287
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,900
achieved renown in some field.

288
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,253
My own theory of success --

289
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:44,436
I'm somebody who's
very interested in success,

290
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,941
I really want to be successful,

291
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,147
always thinking,
how can I be more successful?

292
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:52,152
But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced
about what that word "success" might mean.

293
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,739
Here's an insight
that I've had about success:

294
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,644
You can't be successful at everything.

295
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,931
We hear a lot of talk
about work-life balance.

296
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,106
Nonsense.

297
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,796
You can't have it all. You can't.

298
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,295
So any vision of success
has to admit what it's losing out on,

299
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,996
where the element of loss is.

300
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,544
And I think any wise life will accept,

301
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:14,344
as I say, that there is going to be
an element where we're not succeeding.

302
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:17,376
And the thing about a successful life
is that a lot of the time,

303
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,290
our ideas of what it would mean
to live successfully are not our own.

304
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,029
They're sucked in from other people;

305
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,657
chiefly, if you're a man, your father,
and if you're a woman, your mother.

306
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,046
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home
this message for about 80 years.

307
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,577
No one's quite listening hard enough,
but I very much believe it's true.

308
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,719
And we also suck in messages
from everything from the television,

309
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:38,529
to advertising, to marketing, etc.

310
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:40,796
These are hugely powerful forces

311
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,796
that define what we want
and how we view ourselves.

312
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,796
When we're told that banking
is a very respectable profession,

313
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,796
a lot of us want to go into banking.

314
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,154
When banking is no longer so respectable,
we lose interest in banking.

315
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:56,236
We are highly open to suggestion.

316
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,157
So what I want to argue for
is not that we should give up

317
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,796
on our ideas of success,

318
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,011
but we should make sure
that they are our own.

319
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,796
We should focus in on our ideas,

320
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,551
and make sure that we own them;

321
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,996
that we are truly the authors
of our own ambitions.

322
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,821
Because it's bad enough
not getting what you want,

323
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,932
but it's even worse to have
an idea of what it is you want,

324
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,996
and find out, at the end of the journey,

325
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,184
that it isn't, in fact,
what you wanted all along.

326
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,796
So, I'm going to end it there.

327
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,796
But what I really want to stress is:
by all means, success, yes.

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,392
But let's accept the strangeness
of some of our ideas.

329
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,161
Let's probe away
at our notions of success.

330
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:36,796
Let's make sure our ideas of success
are truly our own.

331
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,796
Thank you very much.

332
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,104
(Applause)

333
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,335
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.

334
00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:01,796
But how do you reconcile this idea

335
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,590
of it being bad to think
of someone as a "loser,"

336
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:09,452
with the idea that a lot of people like,
of seizing control of your life,

337
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,381
and that a society that encourages that,

338
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,796
perhaps has to have
some winners and losers?

339
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,471
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think
it's merely the randomness

340
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:20,161
of the winning and losing process
that I want to stress,

341
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,796
because the emphasis nowadays is so much
on the justice of everything,

342
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,821
and politicians always talk about justice.

343
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:29,253
Now I'm a firm believer in justice,
I just think that it's impossible.

344
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:32,880
So we should do everything
we can to pursue it,

345
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:36,340
but we should always remember
that whoever is facing us,

346
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:38,507
whatever has happened in their lives,

347
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:40,796
there will be a strong
element of the haphazard.

348
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,036
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;

349
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,126
otherwise, it can get
quite claustrophobic.

350
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,375
CA: I mean, do you believe
that you can combine

351
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,684
your kind of kinder,
gentler philosophy of work

352
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,796
with a successful economy?

353
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,602
Or do you think that you can't,

354
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:58,300
but it doesn't matter that much that we're
putting too much emphasis on that?

355
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,796
AB: The nightmare thought

356
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,796
is that frightening people
is the best way to get work out of them,

357
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,232
and that somehow
the crueler the environment,

358
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,621
the more people will rise
to the challenge.

359
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,590
You want to think, who would you like
as your ideal dad?

360
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,796
And your ideal dad is somebody
who is tough but gentle.

361
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,033
And it's a very hard line to make.

362
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:21,796
We need fathers, as it were,
the exemplary father figures in society,

363
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,243
avoiding the two extremes,

364
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,796
which is the authoritarian
disciplinarian on the one hand,

365
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,621
and on the other,
the lax, no-rules option.

366
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,018
CA: Alain De Botton.

367
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,797
AB: Thank you very much.

368
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:41,708
(Applause)
