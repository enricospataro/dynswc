1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
One of the most common ways of dividing the world

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
is into those who believe

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
and those who don't --

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
into the religious and the atheists.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And for the last decade or so,

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
it's been quite clear

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
what being an atheist means.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
There have been some very vocal atheists

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
who've pointed out,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
not just that religion is wrong,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
but that it's ridiculous.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
have argued --

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
they've argued that believing in God

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
is akin to believing in fairies

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and essentially that the whole thing

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
is a childish game.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Now I think it's too easy.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I think it's too easy

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
And what I'd like to inaugurate today

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
is a new way of being an atheist --

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
if you like, a new version of atheism

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
we could call Atheism 2.0.

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Well it starts from a very basic premise:

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
of course, there's no God.

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
or angels, etc.

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
that's the very, very beginning.

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
I'm interested in the kind of constituency

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
that thinks something along these lines:

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
I can't believe in the doctrines.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
I don't think these doctrines are right.

38
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,820
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
I really like the art of Mantegna.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
I really like looking at old churches.

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Whatever it may be,

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
the moralistic, communal side of religion,

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
but can't bear the doctrine.

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
and then you can have all the nice stuff,

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
or you reject the doctrine and

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
So that's a sort of tough choice.

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
I don't think we have to make that choice.

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I think there is an alternative.

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
I think there are ways --

57
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
of stealing from religions.

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
If you don't believe in a religion,

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
with taking out the best sides of religion.

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
And for me, atheism 2.0

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
is about both, as I say,

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
a respectful and an impious way

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
The secular world is full of holes.

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
We have secularized badly, I would argue.

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And a thorough study of religion

69
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
could give us all sorts of insights

70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
into areas of life that are not going too well.

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.

72
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Now education is a field

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
the secular world really believes in.

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.

77
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,

78
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
it's also going to make us better people.

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,

80
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
those lyrical claims

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
will make us into nobler and better human beings.

83
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
That's a lovely idea.

84
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Interesting where it came from.

85
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
In the early 19th century,

86
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
church attendance in Western Europe

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
They asked themselves the following question.

89
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
They said, where are people going to find the morality,

90
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
where are they going to find guidance,

91
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And influential voices came up with one answer.

93
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
They said culture.

94
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
It's to culture that we should look

95
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.

98
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.

100
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.

101
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.

102
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And that's a very plausible idea.

103
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,820
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
If you went to a top university --

105
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --

106
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
and you said, "I've come here

107
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;

108
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I want to know how to live,"

109
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.

110
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning

111
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
are in the business of.

112
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Why? They don't think we need it.

113
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.

114
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
They see us as adults, rational adults.

115
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
What we need is information.

116
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
We need data, we don't need help.

117
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.

118
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
All religions, all major religions,

119
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
at various points call us children.

120
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
And like children,

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.

122
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
We're only just holding it together.

123
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.

124
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

126
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

128
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,

129
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
advising people how they could live.

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
and children to their parents,

133
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

134
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
He was trying to tell people how they should live

135
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
through the medium of sermons,

136
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
the classic medium of delivery of religions.

137
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.

138
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

139
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
"Hey, how about a sermon?"

140
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.

141
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm an independent, individual person."

142
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
What's the difference between a sermon

143
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?

144
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Well a sermon wants to change your life

145
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.

146
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,

148
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
because we are in need of guidance,

149
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
morality and consolation --

150
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
and religions know that.

151
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Another point about education:

152
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
we tend to believe in the modern secular world

153
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato

155
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,

156
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
and that lesson will stick with them.

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Religions go, "Nonsense.

158
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.

159
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
So get on your knees and repeat it."

160
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
That's what all religions tell us:

161
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."

162
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.

163
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
So religions are cultures of repetition.

164
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
They circle the great truths again and again and again.

165
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
We associate repetition with boredom.

166
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
"Give us the new," we're always saying.

167
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
"The new is better than the old."

168
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.

169
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
We're just going to run through all the old ones

170
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
and watch them five times because they're so true.

171
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times

172
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.

173
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.

174
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
The other things that religions do

175
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
is to arrange time.

176
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
All the major religions give us calendars.

177
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
What is a calendar?

178
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year

179
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
you will bump into certain very important ideas.

180
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,

181
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome

182
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
and his qualities of humility and goodness

183
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
and his generosity to the poor.

184
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.

185
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Now we don't think that way.

186
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.

187
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
I'll just come across it."

188
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Nonsense, says the religious world view.

189
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,

190
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
we need to synchronize encounters.

191
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
This comes across also

192
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
in the way in which religions set up rituals

193
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
around important feelings.

194
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.

195
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
You know, when you look at the Moon,

196
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"

197
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.

198
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.

199
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."

200
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,

201
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform

202
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,

203
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
where you will be given poems to read

204
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time

205
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.

206
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
You'll be handed rice cakes.

207
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon

208
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
will have a secure place in your heart.

209
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
That's very good.

210
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
The other thing that religions are really aware of

211
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
is: speak well --

212
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --

213
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.

214
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker

215
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
and still have a great career.

216
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
But the religious world doesn't think that way.

217
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
What you're saying needs to be backed up

218
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
by a really convincing way of saying it.

219
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church

220
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
in the American South

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and you listen to how they talk,

222
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
my goodness, they talk well.

223
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."

224
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,

225
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."

226
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
If we were doing it like they do it --

227
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --

228
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."

229
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."

230
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up

231
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.

233
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.

234
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
(Applause)

235
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,

236
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
we are also bodies.

237
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
And when they teach us a lesson,

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
they do it via the body.

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
So for example,

240
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.

241
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Jews are very interested in forgiveness

242
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
and how we should start anew and start afresh.

243
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.

244
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
They don't just give us books or words about this.

245
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
They tell us to have a bath.

246
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.

247
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
You immerse yourself in the water,

248
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.

249
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
We don't tend to do that.

250
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.

251
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.

252
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Let's look at art now.

253
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Now art is something that in the secular world,

254
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.

255
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.

256
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
We sometimes hear it said

257
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

258
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
You've heard that saying.

259
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Now I think that the potential is there,

260
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
but we've completely let ourselves down.

261
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
And the reason we've let ourselves down

262
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
is that we're not properly studying

263
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,820
how religions handle art.

264
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world

265
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,820
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:

266
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --

267
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
a ridiculous idea --

268
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble

269
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

270
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
I couldn't disagree more.

271
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,

272
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,

273
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell

274
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
and we might find it too easy.

275
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --

276
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
let's admit it --

277
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
is, "I don't know what this is about."

278
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.

279
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural

280
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
to contemporary art.

281
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.

282
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.

283
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.

284
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Firstly, it's trying to remind you

285
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
of what there is to love.

286
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
And secondly, it's trying to remind you

287
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
of what there is to fear and to hate.

288
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And that's what art is.

289
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.

290
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
So as you walk around a church,

291
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
or a mosque or a cathedral,

292
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,

293
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
through your eyes, through your senses,

294
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

295
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Essentially it's propaganda.

296
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Rembrandt is a propagandist

297
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
in the Christian view.

298
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.

299
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.

300
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.

301
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.

302
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,820
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.

303
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --

304
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
if I was a museum curator,

305
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.

306
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
All works of art are talking to us about things.

307
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
And if we were able to arrange spaces

308
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
where we could come across works

309
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
where we would be told, use these works of art

310
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
to cement these ideas in your mind,

311
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
we would get a lot more out of art.

312
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

313
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.

314
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Art should be one of the tools

315
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
by which we improve our society.

316
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Art should be didactic.

317
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Let's think of something else.

318
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,

319
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
who are interested in matters of the spirit,

320
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
in matters of the mind,

321
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
in higher soul-like concerns,

322
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
tend to be isolated individuals.

323
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.

324
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
And they tend to be on their own.

325
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.

326
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.

327
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
And they don't really change much.

328
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Now think about religions, think about organized religions.

329
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
What do organized religions do?

330
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
They group together, they form institutions.

331
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
And that has all sorts of advantages.

332
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
First of all, scale, might.

333
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year

334
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
according to the Wall Street Journal.

335
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
These are massive machines.

336
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,

337
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and they're highly disciplined.

338
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
These are all very good qualities.

339
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
We recognize them in relation to corporations.

340
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
And corporations are very like religions in many ways,

341
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.

342
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
They're selling us shoes and cars.

343
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --

344
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
the therapists, the poets --

345
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
are on their own and they have no power,

346
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
they have no might.

347
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
So religions are the foremost example

348
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.

349
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,

350
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
but we can admire the institutional way

351
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
in which they're doing it.

352
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,

353
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
are not going to change anything.

354
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
We need to group together.

355
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.

356
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
And that's what religions do.

357
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
They are multinational, as I say,

358
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
they are branded, they have a clear identity,

359
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
so they don't get lost in a busy world.

360
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
That's something we can learn from.

361
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
I want to conclude.

362
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Really what I want to say

363
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,

364
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
there is something to learn from the example of religion --

365
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
even if you don't believe any of it.

366
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
If you're involved in anything that's communal,

367
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
that involves lots of people getting together,

368
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
there are things for you in religion.

369
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,

370
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
look at pilgrimage.

371
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Look very closely at pilgrimage.

372
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
We haven't begun to scratch the surface

373
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
of what travel could be

374
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.

375
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
If you're in the art world,

376
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
look at the example of what religions are doing with art.

377
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
And if you're an educator in any way,

378
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.

379
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
You may not agree with the ideas,

380
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.

381
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
So really my concluding point

382
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
is you may not agree with religion,

383
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
but at the end of the day,

384
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
religions are so subtle, so complicated,

385
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
so intelligent in many ways

386
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;

387
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
they're for all of us.

388
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Thank you very much.

389
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:29,820
(Applause)

390
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,

391
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways

392
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
to be ridiculed in some quarters.

393
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
AB: You can get shot by both sides.

394
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,

395
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
and you can get shot by those who fully believe.

396
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.

397
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
AB: Indeed.

398
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion

399
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
that a lot of people might say

400
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
your agenda could borrow from,

401
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
which is this sense --

402
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --

403
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
of spiritual experience,

404
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
of some kind of connection

405
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
with something that's bigger than you are.

406
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?

407
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people

408
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,

409
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
something else?"

410
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"

411
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,

412
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,

413
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?

414
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Science and just observation

415
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
gives us that feeling without it,

416
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
so I don't feel the need.

417
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
The universe is large and we are tiny,

418
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,820
without the need for further religious superstructure.

419
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
So one can have so-called spiritual moments

420
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
without belief in the spirit.

421
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.

422
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
How many people here would say

423
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
that religion is important to them?

424
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Is there an equivalent process

425
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
by which there's a sort of bridge

426
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?

427
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life

428
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
and these can be plugged.

429
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
It's not as though, as I try to suggest,

430
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
it's not as though either you have religion

431
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
and then you have to accept all sorts of things,

432
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
or you don't have religion

433
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
and then you're cut off from all these very good things.

434
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
It's so sad that we constantly say,

435
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
"I don't believe so I can't have community,

436
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
so I'm cut off from morality,

437
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
so I can't go on a pilgrimage."

438
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"

439
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
And that's really the spirit of my talk.

440
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
There's so much we can absorb.

441
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.

442
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community

443
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
who are atheists.

444
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
But probably most people in the community

445
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon

446
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
and want to find the language

447
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
to have a constructive dialogue

448
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
and to feel like we can actually talk to each other

449
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
and at least share some things in common.

450
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Are we foolish to be optimistic

451
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
about the possibility of a world

452
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry

453
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
of divide and war,

454
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
that there could be bridging?

455
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.

456
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.

457
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
It's seen as hypocrisy.

458
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist

459
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"

460
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
you politely ignore it.

461
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
You move on.

462
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,

463
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
because you have a shared view on so many things,

464
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
and you politely differ.

465
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,820
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.

466
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.

467
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing

468
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
that's not a religion but something else,

469
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
does it need a leader,

470
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
and are you volunteering to be the pope?

471
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
(Laughter)

472
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of

473
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
is individual leaders.

474
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
It doesn't need it.

475
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
What I've tried to lay out is a framework

476
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.

477
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.

478
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,820
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.

479
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.

480
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
So it's a wiki project.

481
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
(Laughter)

482
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.

483
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
(Applause)
