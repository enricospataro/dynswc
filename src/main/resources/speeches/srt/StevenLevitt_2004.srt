1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,820
but other people's tragedy.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own,

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,820
So, if you believe the media accounts,

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,820
was a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,820
There was money, there was drugs, guns, women,

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
you know, you name it -- jewelry, bling-bling -- it had it all.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,820
What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
a unique opportunity to go inside a gang --

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang --

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,820
that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
But I think, more realistically, that being in a gang --

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,820
selling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps the worst job in all of America.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And that's what I'd like to convince you of today.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,820
So there are three things I want to do.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,820
First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,820
had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Secondly, I want to tell you how somebody like me

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,820
came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,820
It's an interesting story, I think.

23
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way,

24
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
the financial records -- the books -- of the gang.

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,820
So before I do that, just one warning, which is that

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
It contains adult themes, adult language.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Given who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know that in fact

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
there'll be no nudity,

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
barring a --

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
(Laughter)

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
-- unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,820
(Laughter)

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
So let me start by talking about crack cocaine, and how it transformed the gang.

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
And to do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine,

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader.

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,820
So being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s.

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
In the early '80s, some would say.

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Now, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up --

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
you got a lot of prestige, a lot of respect.

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
But there was no money in it, OK?

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
The gang had no way to make money.

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And you couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang,

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,820
because the people in the gang didn't have any money.

46
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,820
You can't get rich selling marijuana.

49
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,820
You couldn't sell cocaine.

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
You know, cocaine's a great product -- powdered cocaine --

51
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,820
but you've got to know rich white people.

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
And most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people --

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
they couldn't sell to that market.

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
You couldn't really do petty crime, either.

55
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
It turns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
So, as a result,

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
as a gang leader, you had, you know, power --

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,820
it's a pretty good life --

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
but the thing was, in the end, you were living at home with your mother.

60
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
And so it wasn't really a career.

61
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,820
It was something that --

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
it's just there were limits to how powerful and important you could be

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,820
if you had to live at home with your mother.

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Then along comes crack cocaine.

65
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell, crack cocaine was the

66
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
extra-chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city.

67
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
(Laughter)

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation.

69
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
I don't have time to talk about it today.

70
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
But if you think about it, I would say that in the last twenty-five years,

71
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country,

72
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
the biggest one, in terms of impact on the well-being of people

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
who live in the inner city, was crack cocaine.

74
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
And for the worse -- not for the better, but for the worse.

75
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
It had a huge impact on life.

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
So what was it about crack cocaine?

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,820
It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Because you could smoke crack cocaine -- you can't smoke powdered cocaine --

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism at delivering a high

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
than is snorting it.

81
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And it turned out, there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
but, when it came, it really did.

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And it was a perfect drug. You could sell for --

84
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar, sell it for five dollars.

85
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Highly addictive -- the high was very short.

86
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high.

87
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
And then, when you come down, all you want to do is get high again.

88
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It created a wonderful market.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And for the people who were there running the gang,

90
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money.

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
At least for the people in the top.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
So this is where we enter the picture.

93
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Not really me -- I'm really a bit player in all this.

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.

95
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,820
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart,

96
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
and decided he wanted to get a sociology Ph.D.,

97
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,820
came to the University of Chicago.

98
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Now, the three months before he came to Chicago, he had spent

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
following the Grateful Dead.

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
And, in his own words, he "looked like a freak."

101
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
He's a South Asian -- very dark-skinned South Asian.

102
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Big man, and he had hair, in his words, "down to his ass."

103
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Defied all kinds of boundaries: Was he black or white? Was he man or woman?

104
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
He was really a curious sight to be seen.

105
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
So he showed up at the University of Chicago.

106
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
And the famous sociologist, William Julius Wilson,

107
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,820
was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.

108
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
And he took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him,

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
and decided he knew exactly the place to send him --

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
which was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects.

111
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
And not just in Chicago, but in the entire United States.

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
So Sudhir -- the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city --

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
dutifully took his clipboard and, you know, walked down to this housing project.

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Gets to the first building.

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
The first building? Well, there's nobody there.

116
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,820
But he hears some voices up in the stairwell, so he climbs up the stairwell.

117
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And he comes around the corner --

118
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
This is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic.

120
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
This is a very dangerous job, being in a gang -- you don't like to be surprised.

121
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
And the mantra was: shoot first; ask questions later.

123
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Now, Sudhir was lucky.

124
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
He was such a freak --

125
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
and that clipboard probably saved his life, because they figured

126
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard.

127
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
(Laughter)

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
So his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say,

129
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
well, OK -- let's hear your questions on your survey.

130
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,820
So, I kid you not, the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was,

131
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
"How do you feel about being poor and black in America?"

132
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,820
(Laughter)

133
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Makes you wonder about academics, OK?

134
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
(Laughter)

135
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,820
So the choice of answers were: very good, good, bad and very bad.

136
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following --

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,820
(Laughter)

138
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.

139
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell.

140
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
There was a lot of gunfire;

141
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.

142
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
By morning, the gang leader arrived,

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
checked out Sudhir,

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
decided he was no threat and they let him go home.

145
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
So Sudhir went home. Took a shower, took a nap.

146
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,820
And you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think,

147
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
well, I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead.

148
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
I've been following them for the last three months.

149
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,820
(Laughter)

150
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Sudhir, on the other hand, got right back -- walked down to the housing project.

151
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Went up to the floor, the second floor, and said: "Hey, guys.

152
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I had so much fun hanging out with you last night,

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I wonder if I could do it again tonight."

154
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship

155
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years:

156
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,820
hanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members,

157
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
having the car-windows shot out of his car,

158
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks --

159
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
you name it.

160
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir,

161
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.

162
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,820
And especially for me, as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open,

163
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data

164
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
that he would get from the gang.

165
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
It was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever --

166
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
(Laughter)

167
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
-- but I was glad to be the beneficiary of it.

168
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,820
So what do we find? What do we find in the gang? Well, let me say one thing.

169
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
We really got access to everybody in the gang.

170
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.

171
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
They trusted Sudhir -- in ways that really no academic has ever --

172
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
or really anybody, any outsider -- has ever earned the trust of these gangs,

173
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me:

174
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
their books, their financial records that they kept.

175
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And they made them available to us.

176
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And we not only could study them, but we could ask them questions about what was in them.

177
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,820
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have

178
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
what the sort of bottom line of what I take away from the gang is,

179
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,820
is that if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization,

180
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's.

181
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
In a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's.

182
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
So first, in one way -- which isn't maybe the most interesting way,

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized --

184
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
the hierarchy of the gang, the way it looks.

185
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.

186
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I don't know if any of you know very much about org charts,

187
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart,

188
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
this is exactly what the org chart would look like.

189
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Now, it's amazing, but the top level of the gang,

190
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
they actually call themselves the "board of directors."

191
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
(Laughter)

192
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,820
And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view

193
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
of like, what happened in American corporate life.

194
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
But they had seen movies like "Wall Street," and they kind of had learned

195
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,820
a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world.

196
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Now, below that board of directors, you've got essentially what are regional VPs --

197
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
people who control, say, the south side of Chicago, or the west side of Chicago.

198
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Now, Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment

199
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
of trying to take the Iowa franchise.

200
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
(Laughter)

201
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Which, it turned out, for this black gang, was not one of the more brilliant

202
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
financial endeavors that they undertook.

203
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
(Laughter)

204
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.

205
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
That the guys who are running, you know, the local gangs --

206
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
the four-square-block by four-square-block areas --

207
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
they're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's.

208
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
They are the entrepreneurs.

209
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.

210
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,820
They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.

211
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit,

212
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
depending on how good they are at running the business.

213
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Now, the group I really want you to think about, though, are the ones at the bottom,

214
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
the foot soldiers.

215
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
These are the teenagers, typically,

216
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
who'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.

217
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Extremely dangerous work.

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,820
And important to note that almost all of the weight, all of the people

219
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
in this organization are at the bottom.

220
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
OK, just like McDonald's.

221
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people

222
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
who are taking your order at McDonald's.

223
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
And indeed, it's not just by chance that they're like them.

224
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.

225
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually --

226
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
at the very same time, they would typically be working part-time

227
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
at a place like McDonald's.

228
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Which already, I think, foreshadows the main result that I've talked about,

229
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
about what a crappy job it was being in the gang.

230
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Because obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job,

231
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?

232
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
So what do the wages look like? So you might be surprised.

233
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
But based on the actual --

234
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
you know, being able to talk to them, and to see their records,

235
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
this is what it looks like in terms of the wages.

236
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 in an hour.

237
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
It was below the minimum wage, OK? And this is well documented.

238
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
It's easy to see, by the patterns of consumption they have.

239
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.

240
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,820
There was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.

241
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Now if you managed to rise up -- say, and be that local leader,

242
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee --

243
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.

244
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
And that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get

245
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male.

246
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
If you managed to rise to the very top,

247
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.

248
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Truly, you would be a great success story.

249
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
And one of the sad parts of this is that indeed, among the many other ramifications

250
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities --

251
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
this is what they were striving for.

252
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways,

253
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
because there were no legitimate channels out.

254
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
This was the best way out.

255
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,820
And it actually was the right choice, probably, to try to make it out -- this way.

256
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
You look at this --

257
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.

258
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
The money looks about the same.

259
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Why is it such a bad job?

260
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody

261
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
shooting at you a lot of the time.

262
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
So, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?

263
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
We found in our gang -- and, admittedly, this was not really

264
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
sort of a standard situation;

265
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,820
this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars --

266
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs.

267
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,820
And so the death rate -- not to mention the rate of being arrested,

268
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
sent to prison, being wounded -- the death rate in our sample

269
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
was seven percent per person per year.

270
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,820
You're in the gang for four years; you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.

271
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
That is about as high as you can get.

272
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,820
So for comparison's purposes, let's think about some other walk of life

273
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
where you may expect might be extremely risky.

274
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Like let's say that you were a murderer

275
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.

276
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
It turns out, the death rates on death row --

277
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
from all causes, including execution -- two percent a year.

278
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
(Laughter)

279
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,820
So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street.

280
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
That makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe

281
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,820
that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime.

282
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,820
Now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack --

283
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
and I'm not really focusing on the negatives,

284
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
but really, there's another story to tell you there --

285
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
if you look at the death rates --

286
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,820
just of random, young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States --

287
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
the death rates during crack were about one percent.

288
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
That's extremely high.

289
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
And this is violent death -- it's unbelievable, in some sense.

290
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
To put it into perspective, if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq,

291
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.

292
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,820
So in some very literal way, the young black men who were growing up

293
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
in this country were living in a war zone, very much in the sense of

294
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,820
the way that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war.

295
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,820
So why in the world, you might ask, would anybody be willing to stand out

296
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
on a street corner selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,

297
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years?

298
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Why would they do that? And I think there are a couple answers.

299
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I think the first one is that they got fooled by history.

300
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
It used to be the gang was a rite of passage.

301
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,820
That the young people controlled the gang -- that, as you got older,

302
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
you dropped out of the gang.

303
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
So what happened was,

304
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time --

305
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,820
the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s --

306
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
became very, very wealthy.

307
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
And so the logical thing to think was that: "Well, the next generation --

308
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
so they're going to age out of the gang, like everybody else has,

309
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth."

310
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
So there are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom, right?

311
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.

312
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
And then all of my friends said: "Maybe I should go do that, too."

313
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
And they were willing to work very cheap, for stock options that never came.

314
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,820
In some sense, that's what happened, exactly, to the set of people

315
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
we were looking at, is that they were willing to start at the bottom.

316
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Just like, say, a lawyer at a law firm --

317
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
a first-year lawyer is wiling to start at the bottom,

318
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
work 80-hour weeks for not that much money,

319
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
because they think they're going to make partner.

320
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
But what happened was, the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.

321
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Indeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s

322
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
are still running the major gangs in Chicago today.

323
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
They never passed on any of the wealth.

324
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,820
So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job, and it turned out to be a disaster.

325
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
The other thing the gang was very, very good at was marketing and trickery.

326
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
And so for instance, one thing the gang would do is --

327
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
you know, the gang leaders would have big entourages,

328
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.

329
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
So what Sudhir eventually realized, as he hung out with them more,

330
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
is that, really, they didn't own those cars.

331
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
They just leased them -- because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.

332
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
And they didn't really have gold jewelry -- they had gold-plated jewelry.

333
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.

334
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,820
And really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people

335
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be.

336
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
So for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid --

337
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
they'd give him a whole, you know, roll of bills to hold.

338
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
That 14-year-old kid would say: "Oh, well ..."

339
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
You know, he would say to his friends,

340
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
"Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang."

341
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
It wasn't his money, until he spent it. And then essentially

342
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
he was in debt to the gang, and was sort of an indentured servant for a while.

343
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
So I have a couple minutes.

344
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Let me do one last thing

345
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
I hadn't thought I'd have time to do, which is to talk about

346
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,820
what we learned, more generally, about economics from the study of the gang.

347
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,820
So economists tend to talk in technical words.

348
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Often, our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data.

349
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
But actually, what's kind of interesting is that in this setting

350
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well

351
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy --

352
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
in some sense because it's unfettered capitalism.

353
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Here's an economic principle.

354
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,820
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a "compensating differential."

355
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,820
It's the idea that basically, the increment to wages that a worker requires

356
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks --

357
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
one which is more unpleasant than the other --

358
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
that's what you call a "compensating differential."

359
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,820
It's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks, OK?

360
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,820
So in the words of one of the members of the gang I think makes this clear.

361
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
So it turns out -- I'm sort of getting ahead of myself.

362
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
It turns out, in the gang, when there's a war going on,

363
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,820
that they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money.

364
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
It's exactly this concept.

365
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
Because they're not willing to be at risk.

366
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely.

367
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
He says, "Would you stand around here when all this shit" -- that means shooting --

368
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
"if all this shit's going on? No, right?

369
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
So if I going to be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man."

370
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
So essentially, I think the gang member says it much more articulately

371
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
than does the economist, about what's going on.

372
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,820
(Laughter)

373
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Here's another one.

374
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
So economists talk about game theory --

375
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
that every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.

376
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Here's the translation you get from the gang member.

377
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,820
They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot --

378
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
one thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang,

379
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
if you go and just shoot in the air -- just shoot guns in the other gang's territory --

380
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
all the people are afraid to go buy their drugs there.

381
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
They're going to come into your neighborhood.

382
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
But here's what he says about why they don't do that.

383
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,820
He says, "If we start shooting around there," -- in the other gang's territory -- "nobody,

384
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
and, I mean, you dig it, nobody, going to step on their turf.

385
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
But we gotta be careful,

386
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
because they can shoot around here, too, and then we all fucked."

387
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
(Laughter)

388
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
So that's exactly the same concept.

389
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
But then, again, sometimes economists get it wrong.

390
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,820
So one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like, in terms of ...

391
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,820
The gang leader always got paid, OK?

392
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.

393
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
So we had some theories related to cash flow,

394
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
and lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.

395
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
But then we asked the gang member,

396
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
"Well, why is it you always get paid, and your workers don't always get paid?"

397
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,820
His response is, "You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?

398
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit."

399
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
And I thought about it, and I said,

400
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
"CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses,

401
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
even when companies are losing a lot of money.

402
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,820
And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit'

403
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
could really be important."

404
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,820
But maybe -- maybe "weak and shit" --

405
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
maybe "weak and shit" is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.

406
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
Thank you very much.
