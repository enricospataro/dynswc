1
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:16,010
Philosophers, dramatists, theologians

2
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:18,240
have grappled with
this question for centuries:

3
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:19,796
what makes people go wrong?

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,796
Interestingly, I asked this question
when I was a little kid.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,876
I grew up in the South Bronx,
inner-city ghetto in New York,

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,383
and I was surrounded by evil,

7
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:29,963
as all kids are who grew up
in an inner city.

8
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,312
And I had friends
who were really good kids,

9
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:36,628
who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde
scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.

10
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:39,796
That is, they took drugs,
got in trouble, went to jail.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,679
Some got killed, and some did it
without drug assistance.

12
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,902
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,
that wasn't fiction.

13
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,150
The only question is,
what was in the juice?

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,796
And more importantly, that line
between good and evil --

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,288
which privileged people like to think
is fixed and impermeable,

16
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,985
with them on the good side,
the others on the bad side --

17
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,072
I knew that line was movable,
and it was permeable.

18
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,439
Good people could be
seduced across that line,

19
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:08,667
and under good and some rare
circumstances, bad kids could recover

20
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,987
with help, with reform,
with rehabilitation.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,297
So I want to begin
with this wonderful illusion

22
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,595
by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,480
If you look at it and focus on the white,
what you see is a world full of angels.

24
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,072
But let's look more deeply, and as we do,

25
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:26,117
what appears is the demons,
the devils in the world.

26
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:28,033
That tells us several things.

27
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:31,165
One, the world is, was, will always
be filled with good and evil,

28
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,237
because good and evil is the yin and yang
of the human condition.

29
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,547
It tells me something else.

30
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,599
If you remember,
God's favorite angel was Lucifer.

31
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,547
Apparently, Lucifer means "the light."

32
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,297
It also means "the morning star,"
in some scripture.

33
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:47,526
And apparently, he disobeyed God,

34
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,042
and that's the ultimate
disobedience to authority.

35
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:55,564
And when he did, Michael, the archangel,
was sent to kick him out of heaven

36
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:57,591
along with the other fallen angels.

37
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,796
And so Lucifer descends into hell,
becomes Satan,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
becomes the devil, and the force
of evil in the universe begins.

39
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:08,313
Paradoxically, it was God
who created hell as a place to store evil.

40
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,177
He didn't do a good job
of keeping it there though.

41
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,790
So, this arc of the cosmic transformation
of God's favorite angel into the Devil,

42
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:19,458
for me, sets the context
for understanding human beings

43
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:23,796
who are transformed from good,
ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.

44
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:28,424
So the Lucifer effect,
although it focuses on the negatives --

45
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,103
the negatives that people can become,

46
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,089
not the negatives that people are --

47
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:36,467
leads me to a psychological definition.

48
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,464
Evil is the exercise of power.

49
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,727
And that's the key: it's about power.

50
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:43,316
To intentionally harm
people psychologically,

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,070
to hurt people physically,
to destroy people mortally, or ideas,

52
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,288
and to commit crimes against humanity.

53
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,106
If you Google "evil," a word that should
surely have withered by now,

54
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,796
you come up with 136 million hits
in a third of a second.

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,318
A few years ago -- I am sure
all of you were shocked, as I was,

56
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:07,796
with the revelation of American soldiers
abusing prisoners in a strange place

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,796
in a controversial war,
Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,827
And these were men and women

59
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,138
who were putting prisoners
through unbelievable humiliation.

60
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,606
I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,

61
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,796
because I had seen
those same visual parallels

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,222
when I was the prison superintendent
of the Stanford Prison Study.

63
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,961
Immediately the Bush
administration military said what?

64
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,841
What all administrations say
when there's a scandal:

65
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,715
"Don't blame us. It's not the system.

66
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,139
It's the few bad apples,
the few rogue soldiers."

67
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:38,194
My hypothesis is,
American soldiers are good, usually.

68
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,279
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.

69
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,796
But how am I going to deal
with that hypothesis?

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,340
I became an expert witness
for one of the guards,

71
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:47,507
Sergeant Chip Frederick,
and in that position,

72
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,444
I had access to the dozen
investigative reports.

73
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,268
I had access to him.

74
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:55,593
I could study him, have him come
to my home, get to know him,

75
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:59,024
do psychological analysis to see,
was he a good apple or bad apple.

76
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:02,959
And thirdly, I had access
to all of the 1,000 pictures

77
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,196
that these soldiers took.

78
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,195
These pictures are
of a violent or sexual nature.

79
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:10,178
All of them come from the cameras
of American soldiers.

80
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:13,488
Because everybody has
a digital camera or cell phone camera,

81
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:15,846
they took pictures of everything,
more than 1,000.

82
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,824
And what I've done is I organized them
into various categories.

83
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:23,787
But these are by United States
military police, army reservists.

84
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,779
They are not soldiers prepared
for this mission at all.

85
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:31,476
And it all happened in a single place,
Tier 1-A, on the night shift.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,701
Why?

87
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,327
Tier 1-A was the center
for military intelligence.

88
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,327
It was the interrogation hold.

89
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,552
The CIA was there.

90
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,734
Interrogators from
Titan Corporation, all there,

91
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:44,544
and they're getting no information
about the insurgency.

92
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:47,038
So they're going to put pressure
on these soldiers,

93
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,782
military police, to cross the line,

94
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,796
give them permission to break
the will of the enemy,

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,297
to prepare them for interrogation,
to soften them up,

96
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,547
to take the gloves off.

97
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,699
Those are the euphemisms,
and this is how it was interpreted.

98
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,224
Let's go down to that dungeon.

99
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:04,414
(Typewriting)

100
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,447
[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008

and graphic depictions of violence]

(Bells end)

109
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,685
So, pretty horrific.

110
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,968
That's one of the visual
illustrations of evil.

111
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,753
And it should not have escaped you

112
00:06:56,777 --> 00:07:00,014
that the reason I paired
the prisoner with his arms out

113
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:02,796
with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity

114
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,402
is that that prisoner was mentally ill.

115
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,779
That prisoner covered himself
with shit every day,

116
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,221
they had to roll him in dirt
so he wouldn't stink.

117
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,593
But the guards ended up
calling him "Shit Boy."

118
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:16,796
What was he doing in that prison
rather than in some mental institution?

119
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:20,032
In any event, here's former
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.

120
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,866
He comes down and says,
"I want to know, who is responsible?

121
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,269
Who are the bad apples?"

122
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:25,701
Well, that's a bad question.

123
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,346
You have to reframe it and ask,
"What is responsible?"

124
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,018
"What" could be the who of people,

125
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,579
but it could also be
the what of the situation,

126
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,289
and obviously that's wrongheaded.

127
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:38,158
How do psychologists try to understand
such transformations of human character,

128
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,182
if you believe
that they were good soldiers

129
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:42,016
before they went down to that dungeon?

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,902
There are three ways.
The main way is called dispositional.

131
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,796
We look at what's inside
of the person, the bad apples.

132
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,131
This is the foundation
of all of social science,

133
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,815
the foundation of religion,
the foundation of war.

134
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,059
Social psychologists like me
come along and say,

135
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,202
"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,

136
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:01,576
but you'll have to be aware
of the situation.

137
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,981
Who are the cast of characters?
What's the costume?

138
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,464
Is there a stage director?"

139
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:08,155
And so we're interested in
what are the external factors

140
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,155
around the individual -- the bad barrel?

141
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,371
Social scientists stop there
and they miss the big point

142
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,634
that I discovered when I became
an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.

143
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:18,209
The power is in the system.

144
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:21,474
The system creates the situation
that corrupts the individuals,

145
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:26,282
and the system is the legal, political,
economic, cultural background.

146
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,600
And this is where the power
is of the bad-barrel makers.

147
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,460
If you want to change a person,
change the situation.

148
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,873
And to change it, you've got to know
where the power is, in the system.

149
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,945
So the Lucifer effect
involves understanding

150
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,424
human character transformations
with these three factors.

151
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:44,333
And it's a dynamic interplay.

152
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,423
What do the people bring
into the situation?

153
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,455
What does the situation bring out of them?

154
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:51,796
And what is the system
that creates and maintains that situation?

155
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,728
My recent book,
"The Lucifer Effect," is about,

156
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,991
how do you understand
how good people turn evil?

157
00:08:57,015 --> 00:09:00,278
And it has a lot of detail
about what I'm going to talk about today.

158
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,796
So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect,"
although it focuses on evil,

159
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,980
really is a celebration of the human
mind's infinite capacity

160
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:10,562
to make any of us kind or cruel,

161
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:13,108
caring or indifferent,
creative or destructive,

162
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,410
and it makes some of us villains.

163
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:18,531
And the good news that I'm going
to hopefully come to at the end

164
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:20,322
is that it makes some of us heroes.

165
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:25,020
This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker
summarizes my whole talk:

166
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,187
"I'm neither a good cop
nor a bad cop, Jerome.

167
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,170
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam

168
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,663
of positive and negative
personality traits

169
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,177
that emerge or not, depending
on the circumstances."

170
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,186
(Laughter)

171
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,062
There's a study some of you
think you know about,

172
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:42,273
but very few people
have ever read the story.

173
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,222
You watched the movie.

174
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:47,595
This is Stanley Milgram,
little Jewish kid from the Bronx,

175
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,718
and he asked the question,
"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"

176
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:54,247
People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany,
Hitler, you know, that's 1939."

177
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,664
He said, "Yeah, but suppose
Hitler asked you,

178
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:59,858
'Would you electrocute a stranger?'
'No way, I'm a good person.'"

179
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,978
He said, "Why don't
we put you in a situation

180
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,241
and give you a chance
to see what you would do?"

181
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,350
And so what he did was he tested
1,000 ordinary people.

182
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:11,441
500 New Haven, Connecticut,
500 Bridgeport.

183
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:14,180
And the ad said, "Psychologists
want to understand memory.

184
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,498
We want to improve people's memory,
because it is the key to success."

185
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:18,722
OK?

186
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:23,709
"We're going to give you five bucks --
four dollars for your time.

187
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:27,187
We don't want college students.
We want men between 20 and 50."

188
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,973
In the later studies, they ran women.

189
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:32,070
Ordinary people: barbers,
clerks, white-collar people.

190
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,674
So, you go down,

191
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,209
one of you will be a learner,
one will be a teacher.

192
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,138
The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.

193
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:41,271
He gets tied up to the shock
apparatus in another room.

194
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:44,863
The learner could be middle-aged,
could be as young as 20.

195
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,103
And one of you is told by the authority,
the guy in the lab coat,

196
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,742
"Your job as teacher is to give him
material to learn.

197
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:51,980
Gets it right, reward.

198
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:54,395
Gets it wrong, you press
a button on the shock box.

199
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,273
The first button is 15 volts.
He doesn't even feel it."

200
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,983
That's the key.

201
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,796
All evil starts with 15 volts.

202
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,231
And then the next step
is another 15 volts.

203
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,666
The problem is, at the end
of the line, it's 450 volts.

204
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,796
And as you go along, the guy is screaming,

205
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,011
"I've got a heart condition!
I'm out of here!"

206
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,741
You're a good person. You complain.

207
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,621
"Sir, who will be responsible
if something happens to him?"

208
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,408
The experimenter says,
"Don't worry, I will be responsible.

209
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,761
Continue, teacher."

210
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:23,590
And the question is, who would go
all the way to 450 volts?

211
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:26,190
You should notice here,
when it gets up to 375,

212
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,739
it says, "Danger. Severe Shock."

213
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:31,103
When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" --
the pornography of power.

214
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,667
So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,

215
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,796
"What percent of American citizens
would go to the end?"

216
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,321
They said only one percent.

217
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,911
Because that's sadistic behavior,
and we know, psychiatry knows,

218
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,027
only one percent
of Americans are sadistic.

219
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,251
OK.

220
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:48,413
Here's the data.
They could not be more wrong.

221
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:51,258
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.

222
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:52,796
This was just one study.

223
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,104
Milgram did more than 16 studies.

224
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,361
And look at this.

225
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,988
In study 16, where you see
somebody like you go all the way,

226
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,480
90 percent go all the way.

227
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,295
In study five, if you see people rebel,

228
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:05,662
90 percent rebel.

229
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:09,277
What about women?
Study 13 -- no different than men.

230
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:13,139
So Milgram is quantifying evil
as the willingness of people

231
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,956
to blindly obey authority,
to go all the way to 450 volts.

232
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,388
And it's like a dial on human nature.

233
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,796
A dial in a sense that you can make
almost everybody totally obedient,

234
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,510
down to the majority, down to none.

235
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:29,427
What are the external parallels?
For all research is artificial.

236
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,261
What's the validity in the real world?

237
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:34,299
912 American citizens
committed suicide or were murdered

238
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,308
by family and friends
in Guyana jungle in 1978,

239
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,362
because they were blindly obedient
to this guy, their pastor --

240
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,093
not their priest -- their pastor,
Reverend Jim Jones.

241
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:45,913
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.

242
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,802
And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,

243
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:50,678
a man of God who becomes
the Angel of Death.

244
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:56,716
Milgram's study is all about individual
authority to control people.

245
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,796
Most of the time, we are in institutions,

246
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,357
so the Stanford Prison Study
is a study of the power of institutions

247
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,321
to influence individual behavior.

248
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:08,949
Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I
were in the same high school class

249
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,677
in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.

250
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,883
I did this study
with my graduate students,

251
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,733
especially Craig Haney --
and it also began work with an ad.

252
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,185
We had a cheap, little ad,

253
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,961
but we wanted college students
for a study of prison life.

254
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,349
75 people volunteered,
took personality tests.

255
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,623
We did interviews.

256
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,093
Picked two dozen: the most normal,
the most healthy.

257
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,384
Randomly assigned them
to be prisoner and guard.

258
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,428
So on day one, we knew we had good apples.

259
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,405
I'm going to put them in a bad situation.

260
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,706
And secondly, we know
there's no difference

261
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,072
between the boys who will be guards
and those who will be prisoners.

262
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,622
To the prisoners, we said,

263
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:44,772
"Wait at home. The study
will begin Sunday."

264
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:45,996
We didn't tell them

265
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,215
that the city police were going
to come and do realistic arrests.

266
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,871
(Video) (Music)

267
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:56,859
[Day 1]

268
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:28,107
Student: A police car pulls up in front,
and a cop comes to the front door,

269
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,126
and knocks, and says he's looking for me.

270
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,071
So they, right there, you know,
they took me out the door,

271
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:36,593
they put my hands against the car.

272
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,818
It was a real cop car,
it was a real policeman,

273
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,905
and there were real
neighbors in the street,

274
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,955
who didn't know
that this was an experiment.

275
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:47,203
And there was cameras
all around and neighbors all around.

276
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:50,443
They put me in the car,
then they drove me around Palo Alto.

277
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:56,991
They took me to the basement
of the police station.

278
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,427
Then they put me in a cell.

279
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,369
I was the first one to be picked up,
so they put me in a cell,

280
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,186
which was just like a room
with a door with bars on it.

281
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,900
You could tell it wasn't a real jail.

282
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:17,686
They locked me in there,
in this degrading little outfit.

283
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,005
They were taking
this experiment too seriously.

284
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,862
Here are the prisoners, who are going
to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.

285
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:27,778
Here are the guards
with the symbols of power and anonymity.

286
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,251
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet
bowls out with their bare hands,

287
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:32,747
to do other humiliating tasks.

288
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,013
They strip them naked.
They sexually taunt them.

289
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,574
They begin to do degrading activities,
like having them simulate sodomy.

290
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:41,829
You saw simulating fellatio
in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.

291
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,735
My guards did it in five days.

292
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,982
The stress reaction was so extreme

293
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,442
that normal kids we picked
because they were healthy

294
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,049
had breakdowns within 36 hours.

295
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:54,098
The study ended after six days,
because it was out of control.

296
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:56,252
Five kids had emotional breakdowns.

297
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,579
Does it make a difference

298
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,328
if warriors go to battle
changing their appearance or not?

299
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,105
If they're anonymous,
how do they treat their victims?

300
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,288
In some cultures, they go to war
without changing their appearance.

301
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,040
In others, they paint themselves
like "Lord of the Flies."

302
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,256
In some, they wear masks.

303
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,341
In many, soldiers
are anonymous in uniform.

304
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:19,062
So this anthropologist, John Watson, found
23 cultures that had two bits of data.

305
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:21,425
Do they change their appearance? 15.

306
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,756
Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.

307
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,883
If they don't change their appearance,

308
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:28,120
only one of eight kills,
tortures or mutilates.

309
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,448
The key is in the red zone.

310
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,037
If they change their appearance,

311
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:34,278
12 of 13 -- that's 90 percent --
kill, torture, mutilate.

312
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,416
And that's the power of anonymity.

313
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,345
So what are the seven social processes

314
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,227
that grease the slippery slope of evil?

315
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,377
Mindlessly taking the first small step.

316
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,043
Dehumanization of others.
De-individuation of self.

317
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,969
Diffusion of personal responsibility.

318
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:48,640
Blind obedience to authority.

319
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:50,558
Uncritical conformity to group norms.

320
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:53,796
Passive tolerance of evil
through inaction, or indifference.

321
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,678
And it happens when you're
in a new or unfamiliar situation.

322
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,751
Your habitual response
patterns don't work.

323
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,222
Your personality
and morality are disengaged.

324
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,773
"Nothing is easier
than to denounce the evildoer;

325
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:07,819
nothing more difficult
than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.

326
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:11,415
Understanding is not excusing.
Psychology is not excuse-ology.

327
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,006
So social and psychological
research reveals

328
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,302
how ordinary, good people can be
transformed without the drugs.

329
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:20,627
You don't need it. You just need
the social-psychological processes.

330
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,346
Real world parallels?

331
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,554
Compare this with this.

332
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:28,484
James Schlesinger --
I'm going to end with this -- says,

333
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:31,107
"Psychologists have attempted
to understand how and why

334
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,560
individuals and groups
who usually act humanely

335
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:36,772
can sometimes act otherwise
in certain circumstances."

336
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,035
That's the Lucifer effect.

337
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,488
And he goes on to say,
"The landmark Stanford study

338
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:44,432
provides a cautionary tale
for all military operations."

339
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,796
If you give people power
without oversight,

340
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,303
it's a prescription for abuse.

341
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,738
They knew that, and let that happen.

342
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:54,577
So another report, an investigative
report by General Fay,

343
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,551
says the system is guilty.

344
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,038
In this report, he says it was
the environment that created Abu Ghraib,

345
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,444
by leadership failures that contributed
to the occurrence of such abuse,

346
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:05,378
and because it remained undiscovered

347
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:07,642
by higher authorities
for a long period of time.

348
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,491
Those abuses went on for three months.

349
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,123
Who was watching the store?

350
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:13,394
The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.

351
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,711
He gave the guards permission
to do those things,

352
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:18,799
and they knew nobody was ever going
to come down to that dungeon.

353
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:21,391
So you need a paradigm shift
in all of these areas.

354
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:25,092
The shift is away from the medical model
that focuses only on the individual.

355
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,796
The shift is toward a public health model

356
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,602
that recognizes situational
and systemic vectors of disease.

357
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,963
Bullying is a disease.
Prejudice is a disease.

358
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,155
Violence is a disease.

359
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,947
Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing
with problems at the individual level.

360
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,412
It doesn't work.

361
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:43,252
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,
"The line between good and evil

362
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:45,396
cuts through the heart
of every human being."

363
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,232
That means that line is not out there.

364
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,227
That's a decision that you have
to make, a personal thing.

365
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,796
So I want to end very quickly
on a positive note.

366
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,772
Heroism as the antidote to evil,

367
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:57,691
by promoting the heroic imagination,

368
00:18:57,715 --> 00:19:00,213
especially in our kids,
in our educational system.

369
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,701
We want kids to think,
"I'm a hero in waiting,

370
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,868
waiting for the right
situation to come along,

371
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,435
and I will act heroically.

372
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,137
My whole life, I'm now going
to focus away from evil --

373
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,114
that I've been in since I was a kid
-- to understanding heroes.

374
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,303
Banality of heroism.

375
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,331
It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.

376
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,301
It's the counterpoint
to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."

377
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:22,286
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong,
because they are the exceptions.

378
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,645
They organize their life around this.
That's why we know their names.

379
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,947
Our kids' heroes
are also wrong models for them,

380
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,915
because they have supernatural talents.

381
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,900
We want our kids to realize
most heroes are everyday people,

382
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,028
and the heroic act is unusual.

383
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,343
This is Joe Darby.

384
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,653
He was the one that stopped
those abuses you saw,

385
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,270
because when he saw those images,

386
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:42,865
he turned them over
to a senior investigating officer.

387
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,617
He was a low-level private,
and that stopped it.

388
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:46,819
Was he a hero? No.

389
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,993
They had to put him in hiding,
because people wanted to kill him,

390
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:51,669
and then his mother and his wife.

391
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:53,578
For three years, they were in hiding.

392
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,288
This is the woman who stopped
the Stanford Prison Study.

393
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:59,561
When I said it got out of control,
I was the prison superintendent.

394
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,584
I didn't know it was out of control.
I was totally indifferent.

395
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,199
She saw that madhouse and said,

396
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,128
"You know what, it's terrible
what you're doing to those boys.

397
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:10,796
They're not prisoners nor guards,
they're boys, and you are responsible."

398
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,796
And I ended the study the next day.

399
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,469
The good news
is I married her the next year.

400
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,796
(Laughter)

401
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,820
(Applause)

402
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,276
I just came to my senses, obviously.

403
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,969
So situations have the power
to do [three things].

404
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,774
But the point is,
this is the same situation

405
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,264
that can inflame the hostile
imagination in some of us,

406
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:38,025
that makes us perpetrators of evil,

407
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:40,242
can inspire the heroic
imagination in others.

408
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:43,380
It's the same situation
and you're on one side or the other.

409
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:45,595
Most people are guilty
of the evil of inaction,

410
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,967
because your mother said, "Don't get
involved. Mind your own business."

411
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:51,468
And you have to say,
"Mama, humanity is my business."

412
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:54,683
So the psychology of heroism is --
we're going to end in a moment --

413
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:57,134
how do we encourage children
in new hero courses,

414
00:20:57,158 --> 00:21:00,450
that I'm working on with Matt Langdon --
he has a hero workshop --

415
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:03,517
to develop this heroic imagination,
this self-labeling,

416
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,304
"I am a hero in waiting,"
and teach them skills.

417
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:08,683
To be a hero, you have
to learn to be a deviant,

418
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:11,707
because you're always going
against the conformity of the group.

419
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:16,197
Heroes are ordinary people whose social
actions are extraordinary. Who act.

420
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,972
The key to heroism is two things.

421
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:20,377
You have to act
when other people are passive.

422
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:23,168
B: You have to act socio-centrically,
not egocentrically.

423
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:26,975
And I want to end with a known story
about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.

424
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,796
Fifty-year-old African-American
construction worker standing on a subway.

425
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,348
A white guy falls on the tracks.

426
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:34,832
The subway train is coming.
There's 75 people there.

427
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,352
You know what? They freeze.

428
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,242
He's got a reason not to get involved.

429
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,683
He's black, the guy's white,
and he's got two kids.

430
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,660
Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,

431
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:45,161
jumps on the tracks,
puts the guy between the tracks,

432
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:47,355
lays on him, the subway goes over him.

433
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:50,637
Wesley and the guy --
20 and a half inches height.

434
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,951
The train clearance is 21 inches.

435
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,603
A half an inch
would have taken his head off.

436
00:21:56,197 --> 00:22:00,266
And he said, "I did what anyone could do,"
no big deal to jump on the tracks.

437
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,938
And the moral imperative
is "I did what everyone should do."

438
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:06,349
And so one day,
you will be in a new situation.

439
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,440
Take path one, you're going
to be a perpetrator of evil.

440
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,796
Evil, meaning you're going to be
Arthur Andersen.

441
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,535
You're going to cheat,
or you're going to allow bullying.

442
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,373
Path two, you become guilty
of the evil of passive inaction.

443
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:19,120
Path three, you become a hero.

444
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:23,562
The point is, are we ready to take
the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,

445
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:25,790
waiting for the right
situation to come along

446
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:27,880
to put heroic imagination into action?

447
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:30,698
Because it may only happen
once in your life,

448
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:32,865
and when you pass it by,
you'll always know,

449
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:35,324
I could have been a hero
and I let it pass me by.

450
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:37,521
So the point is thinking it
and then doing it.

451
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,167
So I want to thank you. Thank you.

452
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,193
Let's oppose the power of evil systems
at home and abroad,

453
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,796
and let's focus on the positive.

454
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,341
Advocate for respect of personal dignity,
for justice and peace,

455
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,703
which sadly our administration
has not been doing.

456
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:51,977
Thanks so much.

457
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,110
(Applause)
