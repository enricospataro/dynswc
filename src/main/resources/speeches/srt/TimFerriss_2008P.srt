1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,820
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
and not without reason.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
I had a very charming routine at the time,

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
which was to wait until late in the evening

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
scream at the top of my lungs and run out

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
because I was the Incredible Hulk.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
(Laughter)

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Obviously, you see the resemblance.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
And this routine went on for some time.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
When I was seven I went to summer camp.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
And at noon each day

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
the campers would go to a pond,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
where they had floating docks.

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
You could jump off the end into the deep end.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I was born premature. I was always very small.

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
And I've always had buoyancy problems.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
So water was something that scared me to begin with.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
But I would go in on occasion.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And on one particular day,

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
So I dove through the inner tube,

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,820
And I tried to come up for air,

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,820
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,820
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
That is something that I did not get over.

37
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
My inability to swim has been

38
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
But there is a happy ending to this story.

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,820
At age 31 -- that's my age now --

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,820
in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,820
and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
And went from swimming one lap --

45
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,

46
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --

47
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I measured it --

48
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
to going to Montauk on Long Island,

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
close to where I grew up,

50
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
And I came out,

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
in my Speedos, European style,

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.

55
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable

58
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,820
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
a world-class language learner,

60
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
and a tango champion.

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
And I would like to share my art.

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things

63
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
that really scare the living hell out of me.

64
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
So, moving onward.

65
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Swimming, first principles.

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
First principles, this is very important.

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I find that the best results in life

68
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,820
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.

69
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And the turnaround in swimming came

70
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --

71
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --

72
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."

73
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
So the clock started ticking.

74
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
I started seeking out triathletes

75
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,820
because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
I tried kickboards.

77
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
My feet would slice through the water like razors,

78
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Hand paddles, everything.

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,

82
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,

83
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."

84
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
And he introduced me to

85
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin

86
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.

87
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.

88
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
So here are the new rules of swimming,

89
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.

90
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.

91
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent

94
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.

95
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
The problem is hydrodynamics.

96
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
So what you want to focus on instead

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

99
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.

100
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
The only way you can do that

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is to not swim on top of the water.

102
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,

103
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
at least, submerged naturally.

104
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
So you end up, number three,

105
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
But actually rotating from streamlined right

108
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
to streamlined left,

109
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.

110
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.

111
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
And you can see that he's extending his right arm

112
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
below his head and far in front.

113
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
And so his entire body really is underwater.

114
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
The arm is extended below the head.

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
The head is held in line with the spine,

116
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,820
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --

117
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.

118
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Here is an example of the stroke.

119
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.

120
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
You can see this is the left extension.

121
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
Then you see his left leg.

122
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Small flick, and the only purpose of that

123
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.

124
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,

125
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.

126
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Rather, he is entering the water

127
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,

128
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,820
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.

129
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.

130
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Not their fault, honestly.

131
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.

132
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Below is what most swimmers

133
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
will find enables them to do what I did,

134
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,820
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length

135
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
to 11 strokes

136
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.

137
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.

138
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,820
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.

139
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.

140
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is

141
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
to turn with body roll,

142
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,820
and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.

143
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
And that will get you very far.

144
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
That's it. That's really all you need to know.

145
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Languages. Material versus method.

146
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
I, like many people, came to the conclusion

147
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
that I was terrible at languages.

148
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,820
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,

149
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
and the sum total of my knowledge

150
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"

151
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,820
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.

152
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and

153
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,820
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.

155
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.

156
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.

157
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,820
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

158
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,820
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.

159
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.

160
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.

161
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.

162
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,

163
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
all things considered.

164
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
My first evening, before my first day of school,

165
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
I said to my mother, very politely,

166
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."

167
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
So, (Japanese)

168
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,820
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.

169
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."

170
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
(Laughter)

171
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.

172
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
(Laughter)

173
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
I walked in to school.

174
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.

175
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
because it was Kanji,

177
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.

178
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Asked him what this said.

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,

180
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,820
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

181
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Traditional Japanese." And so on.

182
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
And so it came to me in waves.

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
There had been something lost in translation.

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.

185
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,820
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --

186
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,820
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.

187
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And that's pretty much my response.

188
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
(Laughter)

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,820
And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.

190
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.

191
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.

192
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Nothing worked until I found this.

193
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,820
This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,

194
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,820
or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters

195
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.

196
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,

197
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.

198
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.

199
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
As soon as I focused on this material,

200
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
I took off.

201
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,

202
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --

203
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.

204
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,

205
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,820
and have continued to apply this material

206
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.

207
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Someone who was terrible at languages,

208
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,820
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.

209
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
This brings us to the point,

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,

211
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.

212
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --

213
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.

214
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
You can also do this with grammar.

215
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,820
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.

216
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,

217
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,

218
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
will show you subject, object, verb,

219
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
From that point, you can then, if you want to,

221
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.

222
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.

223
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And now I love languages.

224
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --

225
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
very important.

226
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."

227
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
But no, you'd be wrong

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --

229
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.

230
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.

231
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
And so I ended up walking like this.

232
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

233
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Not very good for ballroom dancing.

234
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
I found myself in Argentina in 2005,

235
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.

236
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Went in, paid my ten pesos,

237
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.

238
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
The instructor says, "You are participating."

239
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Immediately: death sweat.

240
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
(Laughter)

241
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --

242
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.

243
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,

244
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
that it exploded in my face,

245
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
never to return to the ballroom dancing club.

246
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.

247
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
"Okay, come on, grab me."

248
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Gorgeous assistant instructor.

249
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.

250
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.

251
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
And she pulled back, threw down her arms,

252
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,

253
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,820
"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,

254
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"

255
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
(Laughter)

256
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
which I found encouraging.

257
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
(Laughter)

258
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.

259
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."

260
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,

261
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
"Of Mice and Men" style.

262
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
And she looked up and said,

263
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
"Now that's better."

264
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
So I bought a month's worth of classes.

265
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
(Laughter)

266
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
And proceeded to look at --

267
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --

268
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Parkinson's Law,

269
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,820
the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.

270
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.

271
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
I got a female instructor first,

272
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
to teach me the female role, the follow,

273
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities

274
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.

275
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,

276
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
along with her, of the

277
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.

278
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.

279
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I compared the two lists,

280
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
and what you find is that there is explicitly,

281
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
expertise they recommended, certain training methods.

282
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Then there were implicit commonalities

283
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
that none of them seemed to be practicing.

284
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,

285
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.

286
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --

287
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,820
the tango dancers will use very short steps.

288
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.

289
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
So you can have --

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
and you can do it in a very small space in fact.

291
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Secondly, different types of pivots.

292
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Thirdly, variation in tempo.

293
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete

294
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.

295
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
That photo is of the

296
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.

297
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Then one month later, went to the world championships,

298
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,

299
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
two weeks later.

300
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I want you to see part of what I practiced.

301
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm going to jump forward here.

302
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,820
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.

303
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
His name is Gabriel Misse.

304
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,820
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,

305
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes

306
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
and his pivots.

307
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.

308
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,820
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.

309
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Now what I like about this video

310
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together

311
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.

312
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.

313
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,

314
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
the strength in my feet, to do that.

315
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
So he uses a lead that focuses on

316
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
his shoulder girdle and his arm.

317
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.

318
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
That's just one benefit of that.

319
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
So then we broke it down.

320
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
This would be an example of one pivot.

321
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
This is a back step pivot.

322
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
There are many different types.

323
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
I have hundreds of hours of footage --

324
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
all categorized, much like George Carlin

325
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
categorized his comedy.

326
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
So using my arch-nemesis,

327
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.

328
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.

329
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.

330
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
And the best results that I've had in life,

332
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:

333
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
what's the worst that can happen?

334
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.

335
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Take the analytical frameworks,

336
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.

337
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Apply them to very big dreams.

338
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.

339
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
When I imagine my life,

340
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
what my life would have been like

341
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
without the educational opportunities that I had,

342
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
it makes me wonder.

343
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct

344
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
the American public school system,

345
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
to either fix it or replace it.

346
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --

347
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,

348
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
my readers, at this point.

349
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
And if any of you are interested in that,

350
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I would love to speak with you.

351
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

352
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.

353
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Thank you very much.

354
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
(Applause)
