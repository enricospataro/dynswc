1
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,768
I'm going to ask and try to answer,

2
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:19,666
in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,020
Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,106
suffer in war;

5
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:26,570
I don't think any civilian has ever missed

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,932
the war that they were subjected to.

7
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:31,950
I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,278
and one of the remarkable things for me

9
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:39,162
is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.

10
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,467
How is it someone can go through

11
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,804
the worst experience imaginable,

12
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,780
and come home, back to their home,

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,241
and their family, their country, and miss the war?

14
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,812
How does that work? What does it mean?

15
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:56,270
We have to answer that question,

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,137
because if we don't, it'll be impossible

17
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:00,405
to bring soldiers back

18
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:04,460
to a place in society where they belong,

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,713
and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,

20
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:09,731
if we don't understand how that mechanism works.

21
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:12,993
The problem is that war

22
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:16,830
does not have a simple, neat truth,

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,529
one simple, neat truth.

24
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,790
Any sane person hates war,

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,645
hates the idea of war,

26
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:26,222
wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,

27
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:29,338
doesn't want to be near it,
doesn't want to know about it.

28
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,022
That's a sane response to war.

29
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:34,789
But if I asked all of you in this room,

30
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,147
who here has paid money

31
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,133
to go to a cinema

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,523
and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,

33
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:47,081
most of you would probably raise your hands.

34
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,677
That's what's so complicated about war.

35
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,217
And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people

36
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:56,456
finds something compelling about war,

37
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,199
so do 20-year-old soldiers

38
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,461
who have been trained in it, I promise you.

39
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,765
That's the thing that has to be understood.

40
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:08,587
I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,

41
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,213
but my most intense experiences in combat

42
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:15,445
were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.

43
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:16,760
I've been in Africa, the Middle East,

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,510
Afghanistan in the '90s,

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,357
but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,

46
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:24,990
that I was confronted with

47
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,510
very intense combat.

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,550
I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley

49
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,383
in eastern Afghanistan.

50
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:33,169
It was six miles long.

51
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,311
There were 150 men of
Battle Company in that valley,

52
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:39,845
and for a while, while I was there,

53
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:42,121
almost 20 percent of all the combat

54
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,917
in all of Afghanistan was happening

55
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,750
in those six miles.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,301
A hundred and fifty men were absorbing

57
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,453
almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces

58
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,979
in the country, for a couple months.

59
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,116
It was very intense.

60
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:58,185
I spent most of my time at a small outpost

61
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,759
called Restrepo.

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,319
It was named after the platoon medic

63
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,173
that had been killed about two
months into the deployment.

64
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:08,113
It was a few plywood B-huts

65
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:11,922
clinging to a side of a ridge,

66
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:16,699
and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,

67
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,510
and there were 20 men up there

68
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,595
of Second Platoon, Battle Company.

69
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:22,195
I spent most of my time up there.

70
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:23,810
There was no running water.

71
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,821
There was no way to bathe.

72
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,260
The guys were up there for a month at a time.

73
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,784
They never even got out of their clothes.

74
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:30,934
They fought. The worked.

75
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,680
They slept in the same clothes.

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,159
They never took them off,
and at the end of the month,

77
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,470
they went back down to the company headquarters,

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,537
and by then, their clothes were unwearable.

79
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:41,830
They burned them and got a new set.

80
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,540
There was no Internet. There was no phone.

81
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,449
There was no communication
with the outside world up there.

82
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,279
There was no cooked food.

83
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,850
There was nothing up there

84
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,750
that young men typically like:

85
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,031
no cars, no girls, no television, nothing

86
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,895
except combat.

87
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:03,856
Combat they did learn to like.

88
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,307
I remember one day, it was a very hot day

89
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:08,073
in the spring,

90
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,454
and we hadn't been in a fight

91
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,900
in a couple of weeks, maybe.

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,464
Usually, the outpost was attacked,

93
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,327
and we hadn't seen any
combat in a couple of weeks,

94
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,930
and everyone was just stunned

95
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,087
with boredom and heat.

96
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:27,621
And I remember the lieutenant walking past me

97
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,094
sort of stripped to the waist.

98
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:31,496
It was incredibly hot.

99
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,860
Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,612
"Oh God, please someone attack us today."

101
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,962
That's how bored they were.

102
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:42,028
That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,

103
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,688
"Please make something happen

104
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,731
because we're going crazy."

105
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,079
To understand that,

106
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,989
you have to, for a moment,

107
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,390
think about combat not morally --

108
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,275
that's an important job to do —

109
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,168
but for a moment, don't think about it morally,

110
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:00,039
think about it neurologically.

111
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,251
Let's think about what happens in your brain

112
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,624
when you're in combat.

113
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:06,976
First of all, the experience

114
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:11,590
is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,580
It's not what I had expected.

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,310
Usually, you're not scared.

117
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,430
I've been very scared in combat,

118
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,532
but most of the time when I was out there,

119
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:21,659
I wasn't scared.

120
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,186
I was very scared beforehand

121
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:25,101
and incredibly scared afterwards,

122
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,703
and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.

123
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,655
I haven't been shot at in six years,

124
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:32,008
and I was woken up very abruptly this morning

125
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:35,253
by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,

126
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,460
six years later.

127
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,194
I've never even been strafed by aircraft,

128
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,570
and I was having nightmares about it.

129
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,943
Time slows down.

130
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,167
You get this weird tunnel vision.

131
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,828
You notice some details very, very, very accurately

132
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:51,015
and other things drop out.

133
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,978
It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.

134
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,449
What's happening in your brain

135
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,166
is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline

136
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,986
pumped through your system.

137
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,580
Young men will go to great lengths

138
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,916
to have that experience.

139
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,838
It's wired into us.

140
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:11,680
It's hormonally supported.

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,565
The mortality rate for young men in society

142
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:17,985
is six times what it is for young women

143
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,790
from violence and from accidents,

144
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,979
just the stupid stuff that young men do:

145
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,281
jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,

146
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,700
lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,

147
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,938
I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

148
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,979
They die at six times the rate

149
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,419
that young women do.

150
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,323
Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,

151
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,966
you would be safer in the fire department

152
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,530
or the police department in most American cities

153
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,052
than just walking around the
streets of your hometown

154
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,410
looking for something to do,

155
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,460
statistically.

156
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,708
You can imagine how that plays out in combat.

157
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,770
At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,

158
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,464
including me,

159
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,524
including my good friend Tim Hetherington,

160
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,946
who was later killed in Libya.

161
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,622
There were guys walking around

162
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,443
with bullet holes in their uniforms,

163
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,330
rounds that had cut through the fabric

164
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,712
and didn't touch their bodies.

165
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:13,794
I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,

166
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:16,791
not much going on, sort of spacing out,

167
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,298
and some sand was kicked into the side of,

168
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:22,968
sort of hit the side of my face.

169
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,181
Something hit the side of my face,
and I didn't know what it was.

170
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,720
You have to understand about bullets

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,618
that they go a lot faster than sound,

172
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:30,031
so if someone shoots at you

173
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:32,088
from a few hundred meters,

174
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:35,231
the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,

175
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,883
half a second or so before
the sound catches up to it.

176
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:40,770
So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.

177
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,770
Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.

178
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,784
It was machine gun fire.

179
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,130
It was the first round, the first burst

180
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,993
of an hour-long firefight.

181
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:52,058
What had happened was the bullet hit,

182
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:55,801
a bullet hit three or four inches
from the side of my head.

183
00:07:55,801 --> 00:08:00,450
Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,

184
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,330
think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.

185
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,792
At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.

186
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:09,088
Just think about the math on that.

187
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,872
Every guy up there

188
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,794
had some experience like that,

189
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:16,322
at least once, if not many times.

190
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:18,802
The boys are up there for a year.

191
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,571
They got back.

192
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,930
Some of them got out of the Army

193
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,524
and had tremendous psychological
problems when they got home.

194
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,059
Some of them stayed in the Army

195
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,682
and were more or less okay, psychologically.

196
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:32,759
I was particularly close to a
guy named Brendan O'Byrne.

197
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,647
I'm still very good friends with him.

198
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,703
He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.

199
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:39,671
I had a dinner party one night.

200
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,465
I invited him,

201
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:44,900
and he started talking with a woman,

202
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,137
one of my friends,

203
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:49,189
and she knew how bad it had been out there,

204
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:50,938
and she said, "Brendan,

205
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:54,266
is there anything at all that you miss about

206
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,820
being out in Afghanistan, about the war?"

207
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,989
And he thought about it quite a long time,

208
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:06,372
and finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

209
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:09,814
And he's one of the most traumatized people

210
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:12,903
I've seen from that war.

211
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,914
"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

212
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:17,999
What is he talking about?

213
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,441
He's not a psychopath.

214
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,100
He doesn't miss killing people.

215
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,380
He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,082
and seeing his friends get killed.

217
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:30,910
What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.

218
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,636
If we're going to stop war, we
have to answer that question.

219
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:42,814
I think what he missed is brotherhood.

220
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,570
He missed, in some ways,

221
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,966
the opposite of killing.

222
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,298
What he missed was connection

223
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,646
to the other men he was with.

224
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:53,162
Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.

225
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:56,916
Friendship happens in society, obviously.

226
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,454
The more you like someone,

227
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:00,528
the more you'd be willing to do for them.

228
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:02,034
Brotherhood has nothing to do

229
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,526
with how you feel about the other person.

230
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,508
It's a mutual agreement in a group

231
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,750
that you will put the welfare of the group,

232
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,770
you will put the safety of everyone in the group

233
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,630
above your own.

234
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,007
In effect, you're saying,

235
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:23,422
"I love these other people more than I love myself."

236
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,820
Brendan was a team leader

237
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,683
in command of three men,

238
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:30,120
and the worst day in Afghanistan —

239
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,999
He was almost killed so many times.

240
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,334
It didn't bother him.

241
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,912
The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan

242
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,728
was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet

243
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:44,212
in the helmet, knocked him over.

244
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:45,340
They thought he was dead.

245
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,790
It was in the middle of a huge firefight.

246
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,810
No one could deal with it, and a minute later,

247
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,850
Kyle Steiner sat back up

248
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,775
from the dead, as it were,

249
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,800
because he'd come back to consciousness.

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,072
The bullet had just knocked him out.

251
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,999
It glanced off the helmet.

252
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,065
He remembers people saying,

253
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,527
as he was sort of half-conscious,

254
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:05,026
he remembers people saying,

255
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:07,097
"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."

256
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,719
And he was thinking, "I'm not dead."

257
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,467
And he sat up.

258
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,664
And Brendan realized after that

259
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,305
that he could not protect his men,

260
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:16,683
and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,

261
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,648
was realizing that.

262
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,160
That's brotherhood.

263
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,592
This wasn't invented recently.

264
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,089
Many of you have probably read "The Iliad."

265
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,060
Achilles surely would have risked his life

266
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,838
or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.

267
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:36,776
In World War II, there were many stories

268
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:39,852
of soldiers who were wounded,

269
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:41,919
were brought to a rear base hospital,

270
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,275
who went AWOL,

271
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,495
crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,

272
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,093
went AWOL, wounded,

273
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,495
to make their way back to the front lines

274
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:53,131
to rejoin their brothers out there.

275
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,480
So you think about Brendan,

276
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,836
you think about all these soldiers

277
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,721
having an experience like that, a bond like that,

278
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,601
in a small group,

279
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,499
where they loved 20 other people

280
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:08,418
in some ways more than they loved themselves,

281
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:13,534
you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,

282
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:18,164
and they are blessed with that experience for a year,

283
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,653
and then they come home,

284
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:22,640
and they are just back in society

285
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,479
like the rest of us are,

286
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,905
not knowing who they can count on,

287
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:33,082
not knowing who loves them, who they can love,

288
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,673
not knowing exactly what anyone they know

289
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,907
would do for them if it came down to it.

290
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,493
That is terrifying.

291
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,483
Compared to that,

292
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:47,557
war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,

293
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,054
compared to that kind of alienation.

294
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,444
That's why they miss it,

295
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,922
and that's what we have to understand

296
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:57,325
and in some ways fix in our society.

297
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,255
Thank you very much.

298
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:03,210
(Applause)
