1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Running -- it's basically just right, left, right, left -- yeah?

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I mean, we've been doing it for two million years,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
so it's kind of arrogant to assume

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
that I've got something to say

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
is that something bizarre happens

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
in this activity all the time.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Case in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon,

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I guarantee you, you saw something

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
that no one has ever seen before.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
turns up at the starting line.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
She's 37 years old,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and a few months previously

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
she almost died in childbirth.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport,

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
but she decided she'd go for broke

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
and try for one last big payday

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
in the marquee event,

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
the New York City Marathon.

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu -- some other people had the same idea,

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
including the Olympic gold medalist

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,820
the fastest woman marathoner in history by far.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
Only 10 minutes off the men's world record,

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
That's her competition.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
The gun goes off, and she's not even an underdog.

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
She's under the underdogs.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
But the under-underdog hangs tough,

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
there is Derartu Tulu

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
up there with the lead pack.

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Now this is when something really bizarre happens.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
out of Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
So we all know what to do in this situation, right?

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
and blaze for the finish line.

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Derartu Tulu ruins the script.

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Instead of taking off,

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
she falls back, and she grabs Paula Radcliffe,

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it."

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it.

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
She catches up with the lead pack

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
and is pushing toward the finish line.

50
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
But then she falls back again.

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her.

52
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
And Paula Radcliffe at that point says,

53
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
"I'm done. Go."

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
So that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends.

55
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
She loses the check,

56
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
but she goes home with something bigger and more important.

57
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again --

58
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins,

59
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
wins the New York City Marathon,

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
goes home with a big fat check.

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
It's a heartwarming story,

62
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
but if you drill a little bit deeper,

63
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.

64
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
When you have two outliers in one organism,

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
it's not a coincidence.

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate

67
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
than anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence.

68
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills;

69
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
somehow water's involved.

70
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there.

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And the answer to it, I think,

72
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
where there's a tribe, a reclusive tribe,

74
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
called the Tarahumara Indians.

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things.

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Number one is,

77
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
they have been living essentially unchanged

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
for the past 400 years.

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices:

80
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
you either fight back and engage or you could take off.

81
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,

82
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,820
which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs.

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
The Tarahumara had a different strategy.

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
They took off and hid

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
in this labyrinthine, networking,

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
spiderwebbing system of canyons

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
called the Copper Canyons,

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
and there they remained since the 1600s --

89
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
essentially the same way they've always been.

90
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara

91
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
is, deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
these guys aren't running marathons;

93
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
they're running mega-marathons.

94
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
They're not doing 26 miles;

95
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,

96
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
and apparently without injury, without problems.

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today,

99
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
all the things that we're trying to come up with

100
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
using all of our technology and brain power to solve --

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression --

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
all this stuff, the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about.

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
They are free

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
from all of these modern ailments.

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
So what's the connection?

107
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Again, we're talking about outliers --

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there.

109
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Well, there are teams of scientists

110
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
at Harvard and the University of Utah

111
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
that are bending their brains to try to figure out

112
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
what the Tarahumara have known forever.

113
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries.

114
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
And once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery --

115
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara

116
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
is wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this:

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
three things -- if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone,

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
because nobody else knows the answer.

119
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
And if you know it, then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth.

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Mystery number one is this:

121
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size.

122
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain.

123
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Suddenly humans show up -- Homo erectus --

124
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
big, old melon-head.

125
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
To have a brain of that size,

126
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy.

127
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
In other words, early humans are eating dead animals --

128
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
no argument, that's a fact.

129
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
The only problem is,

130
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
So, somehow, for nearly two million years,

132
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
we are killing animals without any weapons.

133
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Now we're not using our strength

134
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle.

135
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Every other animal is stronger than we are --

136
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed.

137
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel.

138
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
We're not fast.

139
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
That would be an Olympic event: turn a squirrel loose --

140
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
whoever catches the squirrel, you get a gold medal.

141
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws --

142
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
how were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.

143
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
Mystery number two:

144
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now,

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters --

146
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
they all suck; they're terrible.

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
There's not a fast woman on the planet

148
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
and there never has been.

149
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.

150
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy

151
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
who can run faster than 4:15.

152
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
For some reason you guys are just really slow.

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
(Laughter)

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
But you get to the marathon we were just talking about --

155
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years.

156
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Because, prior to the 1980s,

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
medical science said that if a woman tried to run 26 miles --

158
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles,

159
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,820
why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?

160
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
(Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.) Her uterus would be torn.

161
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs.

162
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
The uterus would fall out, literally fall out of the body.

163
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Now I've been to a lot of marathons,

164
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
and I've yet to see any ...

165
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
(Laughter)

166
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
So it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon.

167
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
In that very short learning curve,

168
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
you guys have gone from broken organs

169
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off

170
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
the male world record.

171
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Then you go beyond 26 miles,

172
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans --

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles --

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
you get to 50 and 100 miles,

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
and suddenly it's a different game.

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
You can take a runner like Ann Trason, or Nikki Kimball, or Jenn Shelton,

177
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world

178
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
and it's a coin toss who's going to win.

179
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I'll give you an example.

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
A couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race

181
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
called the Hardrock 100,

182
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
which tells you all you need to know about the race.

183
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
They give you 48 hours to finish this race.

184
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Well Emily Baer -- 500 runners --

185
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10,

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
even though she stopped at all the aid stations

187
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
to breastfeed her baby during the race --

188
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
and yet, beat 492 other people.

189
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
So why is it that women get stronger

190
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
as distances get longer?

191
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
The third mystery is this:

192
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
At the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times

193
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
for people running the marathon.

194
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
And what they found

195
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
is that, if you start running the marathon at age 19,

196
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
you will get progressively faster, year by year,

197
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
until you reach your peak at age 27.

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
And then after that, you succumb

199
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
to the rigors of time.

200
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
And you'll get slower and slower,

201
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19.

202
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
So about seven years, eight years to reach your peak,

203
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
and then gradually you fall off your peak,

204
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
until you go back to the starting point.

205
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed,

206
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.

207
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
64-year-old men and women

208
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
are running as fast as they were at age 19.

209
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity --

210
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard --

211
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
where geriatrics are performing

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
as well as they did as teenagers.

213
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
So you have these three mysteries.

214
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Is there one piece in the puzzle

215
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
which might wrap all these things up?

216
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
You've got to be really careful any time

217
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer,

218
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
because, it being prehistory,

219
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it.

220
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
But I'll submit this to you:

221
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle,

222
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture.

223
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
If you wonder, why it is the Tarahumara don't fight

224
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
and don't die of heart disease,

225
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu

226
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive,

227
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
and why we somehow were able

228
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
to find food without weapons,

229
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
perhaps it's because humans,

230
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe,

231
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
actually evolved as nothing more

232
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
than a pack of hunting dogs.

233
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Maybe we evolved

234
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
as a hunting pack animal.

235
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness --

236
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
again, it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed --

237
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
the only thing we do really, really well is sweat.

238
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
We're really good at being sweaty and smelly.

239
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well.

240
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
But the advantage

241
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
of that little bit of social discomfort

242
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
is the fact that, when it comes to running

243
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
under hot heat for long distances,

244
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
we're superb, we're the best on the planet.

245
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
You take a horse on a hot day,

246
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice.

247
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off,

248
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
but it ain't doing both -- we can.

249
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals?

250
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world

251
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
was the fact that we could get together as a group,

252
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
go out there on that African Savannah, pick out an antelope

253
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
and go out as a pack and run that thing to death?

254
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
That's all we could do.

255
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
We could run really far on a hot day.

256
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Well if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well.

257
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack."

258
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
If you go out by yourself, and you try to chase an antelope,

259
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah.

260
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
You need a pack to pull together.

261
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
You need to have those 64-, 65-year-olds

262
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
who have been doing this for a long time

263
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch.

264
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
The herd explodes and it gathers back again.

265
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack.

266
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
They can't be 10 miles behind.

267
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
You need to have the women and the adolescents there

268
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein

269
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent.

270
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead

271
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.

272
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
They need to be part of the pack.

273
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
You need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers

274
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
ready to drop the kill,

275
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
and you need to have those teenagers there

276
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
who are learning the whole thing all involved.

277
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
The pack stays together.

278
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
Another thing that has to be true about this pack: this pack cannot be really materialistic.

279
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope.

280
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
You can't be a pissed-off pack. You can't be bearing grudges,

281
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
like, "I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope."

283
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego,

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
be cooperative and pull together.

285
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
What you end up with, in other words,

286
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
is a culture remarkably similar

287
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
to the Tarahumara --

288
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
a tribe that has remained unchanged

289
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
since the Stone Age.

290
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
It's a really compelling argument

291
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
that maybe the Tarahumara are doing

292
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
exactly what all of us had done for two million years,

293
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.

294
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing,

295
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before.

296
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
But maybe it's something different.

297
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had

298
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
and we spoiled it.

299
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
How do we spoil it? Well how do we spoil anything?

300
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
We try to cash in on it.

301
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
We try to can it and package it and make it "better"

302
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
and sell it to people.

303
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
And what happened was we started creating

304
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
these fancy cushioned things,

305
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
which can make running "better," called running shoes.

306
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes

307
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt.

308
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And I think that, if anybody in here runs --

309
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
and I just had a conversation with Carol;

310
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
we talked for two minutes backstage, and she's talking about plantar fasciitis.

311
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
You talk to a runner, I guarantee, within 30 seconds,

312
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
the conversation turns to injury.

313
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage,

314
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
why are we so bad at it? Why do we keep getting hurt?

315
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Curious thing about running and running injuries

316
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
is that the running injury is new to our time.

317
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
If you read folklore and mythology,

318
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,

319
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
running is always associated

320
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor.

321
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
It's only in our lifetime

322
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
that running has become associated with fear and pain.

323
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Geronimo used to say

324
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
that, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."

325
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
That's because an Apache triathlon

326
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert,

327
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses

328
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
and slap leather for home.

329
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Geronimo was never saying, "Ah, you know something,

330
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
my achilles -- I'm tapering. I got to take this week off,"

331
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
or "I need to cross-train.

332
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."

333
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Humans ran and ran all the time.

334
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
We are here today. We have our digital technology.

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
All of our science comes from the fact

336
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
that our ancestors were able

337
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
to do something extraordinary every day,

338
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
which was just rely on their naked feet and legs

339
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
to run long distances.

340
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
So how do we get back to that again?

341
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, I would submit to you the first thing is

342
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing.

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.

344
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Stop focusing on urban marathons,

345
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
which, if you do four hours, you suck.

346
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
If you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,

347
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
because you qualified for another race.

348
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness

349
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
and, I would say, nakedness,

350
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
that has made the Tarahumara

351
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time.

352
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
So what's the benefit? So what?

353
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before?

354
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
But maybe there's another benefit there as well.

355
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Without getting a little too extreme about this,

356
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
imagine a world

357
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
where everybody could go out their door

358
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
and engage in the kind of exercise

359
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene,

360
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
more healthy,

361
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
burn off stress --

362
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore,

363
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again.

364
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Maybe there's something between what we are today

365
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
and what the Tarahumara have always been.

366
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons

367
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,

368
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
but maybe there's somewhere in between.

369
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
And if we find that thing,

370
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there.

371
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Because if somebody could find a way

372
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
to restore that natural ability

373
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
that we all enjoyed for most of our existence,

374
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
up until the 1970s or so,

375
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
the benefits, social and physical

376
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
and political and mental,

377
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
could be astounding.

378
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture

379
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
of barefoot runners, people who got rid of their shoes.

380
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
And what they have found uniformly is

381
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress,

382
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
you get rid of the injuries and the ailments.

383
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
And what you find is something

384
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
the Tarahumara have known for a very long time,

385
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
that this can be a whole lot of fun.

386
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
I've experienced it personally myself.

387
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
I was injured all my life, and then in my early 40s I got rid of my shoes

388
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
and my running ailments have gone away too.

389
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from.

390
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much.

391
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
