1
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:15,819
"Give me liberty or give me death."

2
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:18,086
When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,

3
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:21,011
said these words in 1775,

4
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,914
he could never have imagined

5
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,979
just how much they would come to resonate

6
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:28,002
with American generations to come.

7
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,667
At the time, these words were earmarked

8
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:33,040
and targeted against the British,

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,939
but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody

10
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,627
what many Westerners believe,

11
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:42,075
that freedom is the most cherished value,

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,996
and that the best systems of politics and economics

13
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:47,210
have freedom embedded in them.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,004
Who could blame them?

15
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,918
Over the past hundred years, the combination

16
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,961
of liberal democracy and private capitalism

17
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,381
has helped to catapult the United States

18
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,642
and Western countries

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,055
to new levels of economic development.

20
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,773
In the United States over the past hundred years,

21
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,163
incomes have increased 30 times,

22
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:07,834
and hundreds of thousands of people

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,107
have been moved out of poverty.

24
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:14,140
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,519
has helped to spur industrialization

26
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,381
and also helped in the creation and the building

27
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,172
of things like household appliances

28
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:24,395
such as refrigerators and televisions,

29
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:28,443
motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.

30
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:31,125
It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths

31
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,389
of the private capitalism crisis,

32
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:35,156
President Obama said,

33
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,052
"The question before us is not whether the market

34
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:40,687
is a force for good or ill.

35
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:43,910
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom

36
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,988
is unmatched."

37
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,877
Thus, there's understandably

38
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,011
a deep-seated presumption among Westerners

39
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,821
that the whole world will decide to adopt

40
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,905
private capitalism as the model of economic growth,

41
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,212
liberal democracy, and will continue

42
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:03,343
to prioritize political rights over economic rights.

43
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:06,193
However, to many who live in the emerging markets,

44
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,157
this is an illusion, and even though

45
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,264
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

46
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,535
which was signed in 1948,

47
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,830
was unanimously adopted,

48
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,521
what it did was to mask a schism

49
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:22,027
that has emerged between developed
and developing countries,

50
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,125
and the ideological beliefs

51
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,772
between political and economic rights.

52
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,309
This schism has only grown wider.

53
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,879
Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,

54
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,792
where 90 percent of the world's population lives,

55
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,820
believe that the Western obsession

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,447
with political rights is beside the point,

57
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,425
and what is actually important

58
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,646
is delivering on food, shelter,

59
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,744
education and healthcare.

60
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:50,160
"Give me liberty or give me death"

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,923
is all well and good if you can afford it,

62
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,886
but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,

63
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,854
you're far too busy trying to survive

64
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,670
and to provide for your family

65
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,201
than to spend your time going around

66
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:04,212
trying to proclaim and defend democracy.

67
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,059
Now, I know many people in this room

68
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,247
and around the world will think,

69
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:11,230
"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"

70
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,457
because private capitalism and liberal democracy

71
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,723
are held sacrosanct.

72
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,092
But I ask you today, what would you do

73
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,903
if you had to choose?

74
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,717
What if you had to choose

75
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:25,180
between a roof over your head

76
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,857
and the right to vote?

77
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,450
Over the last 10 years,

78
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,230
I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,

79
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,435
many of them in the emerging markets,

80
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,763
in Latin America, Asia,

81
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:39,445
and my own continent of Africa.

82
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,085
I've met with presidents, dissidents,

83
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,453
policymakers, lawyers, teachers,

84
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,756
doctors and the man on the street,

85
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,439
and through these conversations,

86
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,239
it's become clear to me

87
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,167
that many people in the emerging markets

88
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,376
believe that there's actually a split occurring

89
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:58,142
between what people believe ideologically

90
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:00,828
in terms of politics and economics in the West

91
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:03,712
and that which people believe in the rest of the world.

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,583
Now, don't get me wrong.

93
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,043
I'm not saying people in the emerging markets

94
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,134
don't understand democracy,

95
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,043
nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally

96
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,528
like to pick their presidents or their leaders.

97
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,083
Of course they would.

98
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,104
However, I am saying that on balance,

99
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,686
they worry more about

100
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:22,717
where their living standard improvements are going to come from,

101
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:25,000
and how it is their governments can deliver for them,

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,905
than whether or not the government

103
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:29,845
was elected by democracy.

104
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,934
The fact of the matter

105
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,399
is that this has become a very poignant question

106
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,732
because there is for the first time in a long time

107
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:40,302
a real challenge to the Western ideological systems

108
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:42,456
of politics and economics,

109
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,529
and this is a system that is embodied by China.

110
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:49,491
And rather than have private capitalism,
they have state capitalism.

111
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:53,779
Instead of liberal democracy,
they have de-prioritized the democratic system.

112
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,143
And they have also decided to prioritize

113
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:59,800
economic rights over political rights.

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,649
I put it to you today that it is this system

115
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,494
that is embodied by China

116
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:06,454
that is gathering momentum amongst people

117
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:09,542
in the emerging markets as the system to follow,

118
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,562
because they believe increasingly

119
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,237
that it is the system

120
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,638
that will promise the best and fastest improvements

121
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:20,249
in living standards in the shortest period of time.

122
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,828
If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments

123
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:24,650
explaining to you first

124
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,680
why economically they've come to this belief.

125
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,506
First of all, it's China's economic performance

126
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:33,548
over the past 30 years.

127
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:36,268
She's been able to produce record economic growth

128
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:39,903
and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,

129
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:43,082
specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty

130
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,896
by moving over 300 million people

131
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:49,154
out of indigence.

132
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:51,668
It's not just in economics,

133
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,165
but it's also in terms of living standards.

134
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:57,009
We see that in China, 28 percent of people

135
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,832
had secondary school access.

136
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,209
Today, it's closer to 82 percent.

137
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,804
So in its totality, economic improvement

138
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,500
has been quite significant.

139
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,536
Second, China has been able

140
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,672
to meaningfully improve its income inequality

141
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,337
without changing the political construct.

142
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,767
Today, the United States and China

143
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,293
are the two leading economies in the world.

144
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,542
They have vastly different political systems

145
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,864
and different economic systems,

146
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,334
one with private capitalism,

147
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,773
another one broadly with state capitalism.

148
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,846
However, these two countries

149
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:32,953
have the identical GINI Coefficient,

150
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:35,500
which is a measure of income equality.

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,732
Perhaps what is more disturbing

152
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,826
is that China's income equality

153
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:42,147
has been improving in recent times,

154
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,764
whereas that of the United States

155
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:46,827
has been declining.

156
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:49,383
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets

157
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,777
look at China's amazing and legendary

158
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,103
infrastructure rollout.

159
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,762
This is not just about China

160
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,122
building roads and ports and railways

161
00:06:58,122 --> 00:06:59,558
in her own country --

162
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,646
she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers

163
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,237
of road network in China

164
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:07,185
and surpass that of the United States --

165
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,996
but even if you look to places like Africa,

166
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,053
China has been able to help tar the distance

167
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:14,707
of Cape Town to Cairo,

168
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:16,332
which is 9,000 miles,

169
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:20,243
or three times the distance of New York to California.

170
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:24,683
Now this is something that people can see and point to.

171
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,365
Perhaps it's no surprise

172
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:30,086
that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,

173
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:31,954
Africans in 10 countries said

174
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,622
they thought that the Chinese were doing

175
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,516
amazing things to improve their livelihoods

176
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:40,014
by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.

177
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:44,534
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions

178
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:47,905
to age-old social problems that the world faces.

179
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:51,173
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,

180
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:54,425
you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics

181
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,652
continue to be a stumbling block

182
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,753
to the delivery of medicine and healthcare

183
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,623
in the rural areas.

184
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,501
However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,

185
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,397
the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,

186
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,887
using their companies

187
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,159
to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.

188
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,365
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise

189
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:16,615
that around the world, people are pointing
at what China is doing and saying,

190
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,757
"I like that. I want that.

191
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,951
I want to be able to do what China's doing.

192
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,721
That is the system that seems to work."

193
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,394
I'm here to also tell you

194
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:27,141
that there are lots of shifts occurring

195
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,101
around what China is doing

196
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,176
in the democratic stance.

197
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,841
In particular, there is growing doubt

198
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,943
among people in the emerging markets,

199
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,650
when people now believe that democracy

200
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,934
is no longer to be viewed

201
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:43,417
as a prerequisite for economic growth.

202
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:47,658
In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,

203
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:50,566
not just China, have shown that actually,

204
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,252
it's economic growth that is a prerequisite

205
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:55,016
for democracy.

206
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:58,262
In a recent study, the evidence has shown

207
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:00,760
that income is the greatest determinant

208
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,508
of how long a democracy can last.

209
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:06,241
The study found that if your per capita income

210
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,453
is about 1,000 dollars a year,

211
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:11,451
your democracy will last about eight and a half years.

212
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,169
If your per capita income is between

213
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,569
2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,

214
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,611
then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.

215
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:20,435
And only if your per capita income

216
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,566
is above 6,000 dollars a year

217
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:26,310
will you have democracy come hell or high water.

218
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,022
What this is telling us

219
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,595
is that we need to first establish a middle class

220
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:33,712
that is able to hold the government accountable.

221
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:36,087
But perhaps it's also telling us

222
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:37,669
that we should be worried about going

223
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:40,579
around the world and shoehorning democracy,

224
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,389
because ultimately we run the risk

225
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,519
of ending up with illiberal democracies,

226
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,580
democracies that in some sense

227
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,747
could be worse than the authoritarian governments

228
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:52,434
that they seek to replace.

229
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,700
The evidence around illiberal democracies

230
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,520
is quite depressing.

231
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,966
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent

232
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:02,123
of the world's countries today are democratic,

233
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,829
70 percent of those countries are illiberal

234
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,182
in the sense that people don't have free speech

235
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,927
or freedom of movement.

236
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,246
But also, we're finding from Freedom House

237
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,367
in a study that they published last year

238
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,482
that freedom has been on the decline

239
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,054
every year for the past seven years.

240
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,838
What this says

241
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,176
is that for people like me

242
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,786
who care about liberal democracy,

243
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:27,133
is we've got to find a more sustainable way

244
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,478
of ensuring that we have a sustainable form

245
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:31,679
of democracy in a liberal way,

246
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,679
and that has its roots in economics.

247
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,608
But it also says that as China moves

248
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:40,140
toward being the largest economy in the world,

249
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,161
something that is expected to happen

250
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,236
by experts in 2016,

251
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,506
that this schism between the political

252
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:49,868
and economic ideologies of the West and the rest

253
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:52,799
is likely to widen.

254
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,354
What might that world look like?

255
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,916
Well, the world could look like

256
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,181
more state involvement and state capitalism;

257
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,020
greater protectionisms of nation-states;

258
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,529
but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,

259
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,696
ever-declining political rights

260
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,757
and individual rights.

261
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:12,519
The question that is left for us in general

262
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,635
is, what then should the West be doing?

263
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,340
And I suggest that they have two options.

264
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,757
The West can either compete or cooperate.

265
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:25,945
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,

266
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,952
and in effect go around the world

267
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,279
and continue to try and push an agenda

268
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,319
of private capitalism and liberal democracy,

269
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,975
this is basically going against headwinds,

270
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,999
but it also would be a natural stance

271
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,460
for the West to take

272
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,493
because in many ways it is the antithesis

273
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,640
of the Chinese model

274
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,768
of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.

275
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,547
Now the fact of the matter is,

276
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,505
if the West decides to compete,

277
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:54,903
it will create a wider schism.

278
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,756
The other option is for the West to cooperate,

279
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,350
and by cooperating I mean

280
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,860
giving the emerging market countries the flexibility

281
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,907
to figure out in an organic way

282
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,669
what political and economic system

283
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,362
works best for them.

284
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,092
Now I'm sure some of you in the room

285
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,966
will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,

286
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,037
and this is a way, in other words,

287
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,949
for the West to take a back seat.

288
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,404
But I put it to you

289
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,754
that if the United States and European countries

290
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:23,405
want to remain globally influential,

291
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,275
they may have to consider cooperating

292
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,824
in the short term in order to compete,

293
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:30,067
and by that, they might have to focus

294
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:33,302
more aggressively on economic outcomes

295
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,011
to help create the middle class

296
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,682
and therefore be able to hold government accountable

297
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:41,709
and create the democracies that we really want.

298
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,298
The fact of the matter is that

299
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,201
instead of going around the world

300
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,688
and haranguing countries for engaging with China,

301
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:52,648
the West should be encouraging its own businesses

302
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,147
to trade and invest in these regions.

303
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:59,399
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,

304
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,999
the West should be showing how it is

305
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,386
that their own system of politics and economics

306
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:06,536
is the superior one.

307
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,556
And instead of shoehorning democracy

308
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,047
around the world,

309
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,322
perhaps the West should take a leaf

310
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,174
out of its own history book

311
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:16,024
and remember that it takes a lot of patience

312
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,594
in order to develop the models

313
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,927
and the systems that you have today.

314
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:23,399
Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer

315
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,028
reminds us that it took the United States

316
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:28,674
nearly 170 years

317
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,343
from the time that the Constitution was written

318
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,303
for there to be equal rights in the United States.

319
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,665
Some people would argue that today

320
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,179
there is still no equal rights.

321
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,025
In fact, there are groups who would argue

322
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:44,353
that they still do not have equal rights under the law.

323
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:45,935
At its very best,

324
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,187
the Western model speaks for itself.

325
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,348
It's the model that put food on the table.

326
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:51,939
It's the refrigerators.

327
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,971
It put a man on the moon.

328
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,761
But the fact of the matter is,

329
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,411
although people back in the day

330
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,477
used to point at the Western countries and say,

331
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:01,520
"I want that, I like that,"

332
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,679
there's now a new person in town

333
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,118
in the form of a country, China.

334
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,204
Today, generations are looking at China

335
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,844
and saying, "China can produce infrastructure,

336
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:12,960
China can produce economic growth,

337
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,528
and we like that."

338
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,242
Because ultimately, the question before us,

339
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,098
and the question before

340
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:20,803
seven billion people on the planet

341
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:23,903
is, how can we create prosperity?

342
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,818
People who care and will pivot towards the model

343
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,343
of politics and economics

344
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:29,910
in a very rational way,

345
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,375
to those models that will ensure

346
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,356
that they can have better living standards

347
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,979
in the shortest period of time.

348
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,690
As you leave here today,

349
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,095
I would like to leave you

350
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,748
with a very personal message,

351
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,834
which is what it is that I believe

352
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,238
we should be doing as individuals,

353
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:49,607
and this is really about being open-minded,

354
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,946
open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams

355
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,181
of creating prosperity for people around the world,

356
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,105
creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty

357
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,781
for hundreds of millions of people,

358
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:03,565
has to be based in being open-minded,

359
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:05,792
because these systems have good things

360
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,269
and they have bad things.

361
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,978
Just to illustrate,

362
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:12,464
I went into my annals of myself.

363
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:14,246
That's a picture of me.

364
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,486
Awww. (Laughter)

365
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:20,712
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.

366
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,659
At the time of my birth,

367
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,741
blacks were not issued birth certificates,

368
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,085
and that law only changed in 1973.

369
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:30,230
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.

370
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,682
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,

371
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,567
I've gone from not being recognized as a human being

372
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,514
to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today

373
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,092
to talk to you about my views.

374
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:44,816
In this vein, we can increase economic growth.

375
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:48,233
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.

376
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,434
But also, it's going to require

377
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,428
that we look at our assumptions,

378
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:54,655
assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with

379
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,634
around democracy, around private capitalism,

380
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,569
around what creates economic growth

381
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:01,201
and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.

382
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,078
We might have to tear those books up

383
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,649
and start to look at other options

384
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,506
and be open-minded to seek the truth.

385
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,753
Ultimately, it's about transforming the world

386
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,439
and making it a better place.

387
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,657
Thank you very much.

388
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:18,257
(Applause)
