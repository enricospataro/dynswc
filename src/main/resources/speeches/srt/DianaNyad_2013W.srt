1
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:21,345
It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,

2
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,421
the Cuban shore,

3
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:28,009
looking out at that distant horizon,

4
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,507
believing, again,

5
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:33,046
that I'm going to make it

6
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,830
all the way across that vast,

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,200
dangerous wilderness of an ocean.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,947
Not only have I tried four times,

9
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:42,415
but the greatest swimmers in the world

10
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:45,419
have been trying since 1950,

11
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:49,069
and it's still never been done.

12
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:52,950
The team is proud of our four attempts.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,504
It's an expedition of some 30 people.

14
00:00:55,504 --> 00:01:00,104
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,

15
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:02,768
who somehow summons will,

16
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:06,551
that last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone,

17
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,065
after many, many hours and days out there.

18
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:12,536
The shark experts are the best in the world --

19
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:16,418
large predators below.

20
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:19,779
The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom

21
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,747
in all of the ocean, is in these waters,

22
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,282
and I have come close to dying from them

23
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:27,740
on a previous attempt.

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,176
The conditions themselves,

25
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:33,121
besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles

26
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,408
in the open ocean --

27
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:37,953
the currents and whirling eddies

28
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:41,284
and the Gulf Stream itself, the most unpredictable

29
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:45,252
of all of the planet Earth.

30
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:49,265
And by the way, it's amusing to me that

31
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:52,050
journalists and people before these attempts

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,109
often ask me,

33
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,926
"Well, are you going to go with any boats

34
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:59,024
or any people or anything?"

35
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,184
And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?

36
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:05,359
That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation,

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,031
and carry a bowie knife in my mouth,

38
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,450
and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them,

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,362
and maybe drag a desalinization plant

40
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,221
behind me for fresh water.

41
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,951
(Laughter)

42
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:25,672
Yes, I have a team. (Laughter)

43
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:30,015
And the team is expert, and the team is courageous,

44
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,520
and brimming with innovation

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,503
and scientific discovery,

46
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:39,743
as is true with any major expedition on the planet.

47
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,580
And we've been on a journey.

48
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,823
And the debate has raged, hasn't it,

49
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,203
since the Greeks,

50
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:48,887
of isn't it what it's all about?

51
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,255
Isn't life about the journey,

52
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,035
not really the destination?

53
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:55,487
And here we've been on this journey,

54
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:58,046
and the truth is, it's been thrilling.

55
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,817
We haven't reached that other shore,

56
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:03,569
and still our sense of pride and commitment,

57
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,628
unwavering commitment.

58
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:10,186
When I turned 60, the dream was still alive

59
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,139
from having tried this in my 20s,

60
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,797
and dreamed it and imagined it.

61
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:18,566
The most famous body of water

62
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,523
on the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida.

63
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:26,603
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.

64
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:29,183
And when I turned 60,

65
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:31,682
it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment,

66
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:34,999
it wasn't the ego of "I want to be the first."

67
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,817
That's always there and it's undeniable.

68
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,575
But it was deeper. It was, how much life is there left?

69
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:44,760
Let's face it, we're all on a one-way street, aren't we,

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,406
and what are we going to do?

71
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,547
What are we going to do as we go forward

72
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:51,814
to have no regrets looking back?

73
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,476
And all this past year in training,

74
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,187
I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote

75
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:59,400
to paraphrase it, floating around in my brain,

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,303
and it says, "You go ahead,

77
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:04,423
you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair

78
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:08,404
and you be the critic, you be the observer,

79
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:12,563
while the brave one gets in the ring and engages

80
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:15,208
and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails

81
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,044
over and over and over again,

82
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:19,480
but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,564
and lives life in a bold way."

84
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:25,212
And so of course I want to make it across.

85
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:28,948
It is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say

86
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:32,414
that this year, the destination was even sweeter

87
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:33,921
than the journey.

88
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:39,177
(Laughter) (Applause)

89
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:42,459
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking.

90
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,026
And at this point, by this summer,

91
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:48,491
everybody -- scientists, sports scientists,

92
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:53,050
endurance experts, neurologists,

93
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,375
my own team, Bonnie --

94
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,273
said it's impossible.

95
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:01,745
It just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me,

96
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:03,784
"But if you're going to take the journey,

97
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,644
I'm going to see you through to the end of it,

98
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,119
so I'll be there."

99
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:11,838
And now we're there.

100
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,466
And as we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment

101
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,977
before the first stroke,

102
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,503
standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,

103
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:21,196
the Cuban flag is flying above,

104
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,788
all my team's out in their boats,

105
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:30,470
hands up in the air, "We're here, we're here for you,"

106
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,475
Bonnie and I look at each other, and we say,

107
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,430
this year, the mantra is --

108
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,836
and I've been using it in training --

109
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,884
find a way.

110
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,491
You have a dream

111
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,506
and you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.

112
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:47,934
None of us ever get through this life

113
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:51,579
without heartache,

114
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,859
without turmoil,

115
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,817
and if you believe and you have faith

116
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,213
and you can get knocked down
and get back up again

117
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:02,138
and you believe in perseverance

118
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:05,668
as a great human quality,

119
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,534
you find your way, and
Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,

120
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:13,074
and she said, "Let's find our way to Florida."

121
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:15,501
And we started, and for the next 53 hours,

122
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:21,267
it was an intense, unforgettable life experience.

123
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,508
The highs were high, the awe,

124
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,731
I'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you,

125
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,468
to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream

126
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:31,210
as if, as you're breathing,

127
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,953
you're looking down miles and miles and miles,

128
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:40,692
to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on,

129
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,220
it's awe-inspiring.

130
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,240
I have a playlist of about 85 songs,

131
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,819
and especially in the middle of the night,

132
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,874
and that night, because we use no lights --

133
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,674
lights attract jellyfish, lights attract sharks,

134
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:56,059
lights attract baitfish that attract sharks,

135
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,560
so we go in the pitch black of the night.

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,963
You've never seen black this black.

137
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,048
You can't see the front of your hand,

138
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,195
and the people on the boat,

139
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:06,990
Bonnie and my team on the boat,

140
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,047
they just hear the slapping of the arms,

141
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,259
and they know where I am,

142
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,318
because there's no visual at all.

143
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:14,557
And I'm out there kind of tripping out

144
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:16,341
on my little playlist.

145
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,869
(Laughter)

146
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,845
I've got a tight rubber cap,

147
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:21,937
so I don't hear a thing.

148
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:25,078
I've got goggles and I'm turning
my head 50 times a minute,

149
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,120
and I'm singing,

150
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,061
♪ Imagine there's no heaven ♪

151
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,932
♪ doo doo doo doo doo ♪

152
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,904
♪ It's easy if you try ♪

153
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,237
♪ doo doo doo doo doo ♪

154
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,630
And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.

155
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,949
(Laughter)

156
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,765
Now there's a talent unto itself.

157
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:49,127
(Laughter) (Applause)

158
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,605
And each time I get done with

159
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:58,470
♪ Ooh, you may say I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one ♪

160
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,190
222.

161
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,756
♪ Imagine there's no heaven ♪

162
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,820
And when I get through the end of a thousand

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,375
of John Lennon's "Imagine,"

164
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,403
I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes,

165
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:16,182
exactly.

166
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:20,274
And then there are the crises. Of course there are.

167
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:22,357
And the vomiting starts,

168
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,919
the seawater, you're not well,

169
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,431
you're wearing a jellyfish mask
for the ultimate protection.

170
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,035
It's difficult to swim in.

171
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,599
It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth,

172
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,232
but the tentacles can't get you.

173
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,912
And the hypothermia sets in.

174
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:40,321
The water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight

175
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,904
and using calories, and as you come over

176
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,872
toward the side of the boat, not allowed to touch it,

177
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:45,904
not allowed to get out,

178
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,644
but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition

179
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,996
and asks me what I'm doing, am I all right,

180
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:57,528
I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here.

181
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:02,616
I'm in a very different state,

182
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:06,155
and I'm thinking, wow, I never thought

183
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,970
I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here.

184
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,068
It's gorgeous.

185
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:13,719
I mean, how long did it take them to build that?

186
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:19,990
It's just -- So, uh, wooo. (Laughter)

187
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,138
And then we kind of have a cardinal rule

188
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:26,339
that I'm never told, really, how far it is,

189
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,631
because we don't know how far it is.

190
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,963
What's going to happen to you

191
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,741
between this point and that point?

192
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,253
What's going to happen to the weather

193
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:35,444
and the currents and, God forbid, you're stung

194
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,726
when you don't think you could
be stung in all this armor,

195
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,233
and Bonnie made a decision

196
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:44,392
coming into that third morning

197
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,370
that I was suffering

198
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,926
and I was hanging on by a thread

199
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,389
and she said, "Come here,"

200
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,721
and I came close to the boat, and she said,

201
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,356
"Look, look out there,"

202
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:57,425
and I saw light, because the
day's easier than the night,

203
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,278
and I thought we were coming into day,

204
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,922
and I saw a stream of white light

205
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:03,301
along the horizon,

206
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,328
and I said, "It's going to be morning soon."

207
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:11,270
And she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."

208
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,243
It was 15 more hours,

209
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:15,769
which for most swimmers would be a long time.

210
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,860
(Laughter) (Applause)

211
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,528
You have no idea how many
15-hour training swims I had done.

212
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,246
So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision,

213
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,605
went into no counting of strokes

214
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,356
and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking

215
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:38,954
and the parameters of the universe,

216
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:41,615
I just went into thinking about this dream,

217
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:44,575
and why, and how.

218
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,974
And as I said, when I turned 60,

219
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:52,323
it wasn't about that concrete "Can you do it?"

220
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:54,962
That's the everyday machinations.

221
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,585
That's the discipline, and it's the preparation,

222
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,462
and there's a pride in that.

223
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:04,337
But I decided to think, as I went along, about,

224
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:07,862
the phrase usually is reaching for the stars,

225
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,938
and in my case, it's reaching for the horizon.

226
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,953
And when you reach for the horizon,

227
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,863
as I've proven, you may not get there,

228
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:21,848
but what a tremendous build of character and spirit

229
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,029
that you lay down.

230
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,472
What a foundation you lay down in reaching

231
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:29,509
for those horizons.

232
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,052
And now the shore is coming,

233
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,058
and there's just a little part of me that's sad.

234
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:37,441
The epic journey is going to be over.

235
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,272
So many people come up to me now and say,

236
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:44,465
"What's next? We love that!

237
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,625
That little tracker that was on the computer?

238
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,709
When are you going to do the next one?
We just can't wait to follow the next one."

239
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,462
Well, they were just there for 53 hours,

240
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,850
and I was there for years.

241
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,367
And so there won't be another
epic journey in the ocean.

242
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,965
But the point is, and the point was

243
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:07,037
that every day of our lives is epic,

244
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,422
and I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach,

245
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,530
staggered up onto that beach,

246
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,149
and I had so many times

247
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,930
in a very puffed up ego way,

248
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,397
rehearsed what I would say on the beach.

249
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:24,011
When Bonnie thought that

250
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,019
the back of my throat was swelling up,

251
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,981
and she brought the medical team over to our boat

252
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,024
to say that she's really beginning

253
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,441
to have trouble breathing.

254
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,535
Another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater,

255
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,230
the whole thing -- and I just thought

256
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:41,977
in my hallucinatory moment, that
I heard the word tracheotomy.

257
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,489
(Laughter)

258
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,808
And Bonnie said to the doctor,

259
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,586
"I'm not worried about her not breathing.

260
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,345
If she can't talk when she gets to the shore,

261
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,434
she's gonna be pissed off."

262
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:55,125
(Laughter)

263
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,551
But the truth is, all those orations

264
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:02,014
that I had practiced just to get myself through

265
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,561
some training swims as motivation,

266
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,053
it wasn't like that.

267
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,596
It was a very real moment,

268
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:10,988
with that crowd, with my team.

269
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,608
We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.

270
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,849
And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.

271
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,719
And the three things that I did sort of blurt out

272
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:24,170
when we got there, was first, "Never, ever give up."

273
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,454
I live it. What's the phrase
from today from Socrates?

274
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,039
To be is to do.

275
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,146
So I don't stand up and say, don't ever give up.

276
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,912
I didn't give up, and there
was action behind these words.

277
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:40,973
The second is, "You can chase your dreams

278
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,930
at any age; you're never too old."

279
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,052
Sixty-four, that no one at any age, any gender,

280
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,735
could ever do, has done it,

281
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,499
and there's no doubt in my mind

282
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:53,468
that I am at the prime of my life today.

283
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:56,296
(Applause)

284
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,114
Yeah.

285
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,701
Thank you.

286
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,855
And the third thing I said on that beach was,

287
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,544
"It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world,

288
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,536
and in many ways, of course, it is,

289
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:14,413
and in other ways, and the most important ways,

290
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:17,007
it's a team, and if you think I'm a badass,

291
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:18,471
you want to meet Bonnie."

292
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:19,846
(Laughter)

293
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,361
Bonnie, where are you?

294
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,984
Where are you?

295
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:28,774
There's Bonnie Stoll. (Applause)

296
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,096
My buddy.

297
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,361
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,

298
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:38,395
when you achieve your dreams, it's
not so much what you get

299
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,321
as who you have become in achieving them.

300
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,459
And yeah, I stand before you now.

301
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,316
In the three months since that swim ended,

302
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,270
I've sat down with Oprah

303
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,011
and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office.

304
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:54,506
I've been invited to speak in front of
esteemed groups such as yourselves.

305
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:57,216
I've signed a wonderful major book contract.

306
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:59,853
All of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.

307
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,

308
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,628
I'm walking around tall because I am that bold,

309
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:09,052
fearless person, and I will be, every day,

310
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:13,288
until it's time for these days to be done.

311
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,508
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference.

312
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:20,077
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

313
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,928
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

314
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,296
Thank you.

315
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:30,517
Find a way! (Applause)
