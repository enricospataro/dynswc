1
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,585
One day in 1819,

2
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:17,344
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

3
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:20,274
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

4
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:24,314
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

5
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,494
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

6
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,395
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

7
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,724
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

8
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:36,037
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

9
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,300
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,523
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

11
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,727
In their small boats, they carried only

12
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,293
rudimentary navigational equipment

13
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:48,941
and limited supplies of food and water.

14
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:51,145
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

15
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,800
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,749
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

17
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:58,675
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:01,900
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,812
No search party was coming to look for these men.

20
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,674
So most of us have never experienced a situation

21
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:11,177
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

22
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:13,044
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

23
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,338
We know how fear feels,

24
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:17,442
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

25
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,087
what our fears mean.

26
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,924
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

27
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:24,837
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

28
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:27,655
like baby teeth or roller skates.

29
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,150
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,757
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

31
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,496
are hard-wired to be optimists.

32
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,279
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

33
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:40,257
as a danger in and of itself.

34
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:43,254
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

35
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,903
In English, fear is something we conquer.

36
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:49,736
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

37
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,941
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

38
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:56,084
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

39
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,462
something that can be as profound and insightful

40
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:01,116
as storytelling itself?

41
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,709
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

42
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,988
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

43
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,269
When I was a child, I lived in California,

44
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,958
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

45
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,966
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

46
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,007
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

47
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,440
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,615
during every minor earthquake,

49
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:25,918
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

50
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:28,439
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

51
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,311
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

52
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:34,539
is that they have a vivid imagination.

53
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,929
But at a certain point, most of us learn

54
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,815
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

55
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:42,572
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

56
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,552
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

57
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:48,960
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,071
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

59
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,932
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

60
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:58,789
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

61
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,128
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

62
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:06,584
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.

63
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,513
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

64
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,817
from visionaries and young children?

65
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,677
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

66
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:19,364
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

67
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:21,483
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

68
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:25,239
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

69
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,788
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

70
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,491
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

71
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:34,217
but they had very few options.

72
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:36,648
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

73
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:39,388
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

74
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:43,788
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.

75
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,088
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach

76
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:49,864
were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.

77
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,386
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.

78
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:54,064
They'd been told that these islands,

79
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:58,308
and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.

80
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:00,684
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered

81
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,325
and eaten for dinner.

82
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,077
Another possible destination was Hawaii,

83
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,949
but given the season, the captain was afraid

84
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,170
they'd be struck by severe storms.

85
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,962
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

86
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,586
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

87
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,475
a certain band of winds that could eventually

88
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:21,739
push them toward the coast of South America.

89
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,460
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

90
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,971
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

91
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,377
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

92
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:34,738
to starve to death before reaching land.

93
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:38,130
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

94
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,029
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

95
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,683
would govern whether they lived or died.

96
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,893
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

97
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:50,171
What if instead of calling them fears,

98
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,782
we called them stories?

99
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:54,015
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

100
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:57,075
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

101
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,005
that we are all born knowing how to do.

102
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:02,768
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

103
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,633
They have the same architecture.

104
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,310
Like all stories, fears have characters.

105
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,733
In our fears, the characters are us.

106
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:14,035
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

107
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:18,151
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

108
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,719
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

109
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,068
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

110
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:27,024
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

111
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,231
sinking into human skin,

112
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,285
human flesh roasting over a fire.

113
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:35,021
Fears also have suspense.

114
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,311
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

115
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,819
you should be wondering what happened

116
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,920
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,165
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

118
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:48,718
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention

119
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:52,657
on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:

120
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:55,414
What will happen next?

121
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:58,118
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

122
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:00,136
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable

123
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,806
of thinking about the future in this way,

124
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,697
of projecting ourselves forward in time,

125
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,109
and this mental time travel is just one more thing

126
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:10,731
that fears have in common with storytelling.

127
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,224
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

128
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,107
is learning to predict how one event in a story

129
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,851
will affect all the other events,

130
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,900
and fear works in that same way.

131
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,077
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

132
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:26,723
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

133
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,684
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

134
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,873
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

135
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,765
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

136
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,808
What would happen to our minds?

137
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:40,914
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

138
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,035
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

139
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,272
as a child frightened in the night.

140
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,803
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

141
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:51,669
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

142
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,369
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

143
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,872
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

144
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:01,799
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

145
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,030
as the authors of those stories.

146
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,992
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

147
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,496
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

148
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:12,831
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

149
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,832
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

150
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:18,753
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

151
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,379
and the author found that these people shared a habit

152
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,738
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

153
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,259
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

154
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,922
these people read them closely, they studied them,

155
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:33,522
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

156
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,439
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

157
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,517
their businesses were ready.

158
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:41,868
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.

159
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:45,027
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.

160
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:49,949
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.

161
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:53,344
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears

162
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,742
that our imaginations concoct.

163
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,726
So how can we tell the difference between

164
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,546
the fears worth listening to and all the others?

165
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,023
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex

166
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:08,306
offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.

167
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:13,033
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

168
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:16,906
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

169
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:19,233
and instead embarked on the longer

170
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,360
and much more difficult route to South America.

171
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,830
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

172
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,909
as they knew they might,

173
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,604
and they were still quite far from land.

174
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,491
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

175
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,977
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

176
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:41,880
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,243
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"

178
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:49,123
wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,

179
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,747
"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex

180
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,436
might in all human probability have been avoided

181
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:57,003
had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,

182
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,884
steered straight for Tahiti.

183
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:03,449
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."

184
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,495
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals

185
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:10,684
so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?

186
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,551
Why were they swayed by one story

187
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,190
so much more than the other?

188
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,712
Looked at from this angle,

189
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:20,011
theirs becomes a story about reading.

190
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,667
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

191
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,466
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

192
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,316
the artistic and the scientific.

193
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:30,820
A good reader has an artist's passion,

194
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,243
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

195
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,354
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

196
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,565
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

197
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,056
which acts to temper and complicate

198
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:43,454
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.

199
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:46,659
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.

200
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:50,299
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.

201
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,288
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.

202
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:56,412
Of all the narratives their fears wrote,

203
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:00,063
they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,

204
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,282
the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:

205
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:05,233
cannibals.

206
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,514
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears

207
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,995
more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,

208
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,755
they would have listened instead to the less violent

209
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:17,043
but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,

210
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:22,623
and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.

211
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,491
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,

212
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,468
we too would be less often swayed

213
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:29,344
by the most salacious among them.

214
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:31,012
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about

215
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,200
serial killers and plane crashes,

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,066
and more time concerned with the subtler

217
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,120
and slower disasters we face:

218
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,868
the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,

219
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,411
the gradual changes in our climate.

220
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:46,060
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,

221
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,508
so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.

222
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,405
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift

223
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:56,337
of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,

224
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:58,572
a way of glimpsing what might be the future

225
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:02,007
when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

226
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:05,403
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious

227
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,560
as our favorite works of literature:

228
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,605
a little wisdom, a bit of insight

229
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:13,179
and a version of that most elusive thing --

230
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,430
the truth.

231
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,461
Thank you. (Applause)
