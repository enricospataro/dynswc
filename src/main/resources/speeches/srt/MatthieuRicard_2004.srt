1
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:16,206
So, I guess it is a result
of globalization

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,834
that you can find Coca-Cola tins
on top of Everest

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,796
and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,194
(Laughter)

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,795
And so I just came,
two days ago, from the Himalayas

6
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,239
to your kind invitation.

7
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:35,392
So I would like to invite you, also,
for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.

8
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:43,010
And to show the place
where meditators, like me,

9
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:47,006
who began with being a molecular biologist
in Pasteur Institute,

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,284
and found their way to the mountains.

11
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:56,471
So these are a few images
I was lucky to take and be there.

12
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:03,428
There's Mount Kailash
in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,796
This is from Marlboro country.

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,189
(Laughter)

15
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:12,715
This is a turquoise lake.

16
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:14,820
A meditator.

17
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:20,796
This is the hottest day of the year
somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,796
And the night before, we camped,
and my Tibetan friends said,

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,401
"We are going to sleep outside."

20
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,668
And I said, "Why? We have
enough space in the tent."

21
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,516
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,209
(Laughter)

23
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,796
So now, we are going
to speak of happiness.

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,615
As a Frenchman, I must say

25
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,687
that there are
a lot of French intellectuals

26
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:47,772
that think happiness
is not at all interesting.

27
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:48,796
(Laughter)

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,345
I just wrote an essay on happiness,
and there was a controversy.

29
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,620
And someone wrote an article saying,

30
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:57,670
"Don't impose on us
the dirty work of happiness."

31
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:58,796
(Laughter)

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,026
"We don't care about being happy.
We need to live with passion.

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,401
We like the ups and downs of life.

34
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,867
We like our suffering because it's so good
when it ceases for a while."

35
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:12,462
(Laughter)

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,290
This is what I see from the balcony
of my hermitage in the Himalayas.

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,199
It's about two meters by three,
and you are all welcome any time.

38
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,431
(Laughter)

39
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:26,917
Now, let's come
to happiness or well-being.

40
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,796
And first of all, you know,
despite what the French intellectuals say,

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,250
it seems that no one wakes up
in the morning thinking,

42
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,796
"May I suffer the whole day?"

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,155
(Laughter)

44
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:43,796
Which means that somehow,
consciously or not,

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,169
directly or indirectly,
in the short or the long term,

46
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:52,695
whatever we do, whatever we hope,
whatever we dream --

47
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,525
somehow, is related to a deep, profound
desire for well-being or happiness.

48
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:03,165
As Pascal said,
even the one who hangs himself,

49
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:07,443
somehow, is looking
for cessation of suffering.

50
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,828
He finds no other way.

51
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:14,305
But then, if you look
in the literature, East and West,

52
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:19,251
you can find incredible diversity
of definition of happiness.

53
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:23,796
Some people say, I only believed
in remembering the past,

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,796
imagining the future, never the present.

55
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:29,190
Some people say happiness is right now;

56
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,109
it's the quality of the freshness
of the present moment.

57
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:37,339
And that led Henri Bergson,
the French philosopher, to say,

58
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:41,218
"All the great thinkers of humanity
have left happiness in the vague

59
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:44,820
so that each of them
could define their own terms."

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Well, that would be fine if it was just
a secondary preoccupation in life.

61
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:54,590
But now, if it is something
that is going to determine

62
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:57,391
the quality of every instant of our life,

63
00:03:57,415 --> 00:04:01,410
then we better know what it is,
have some clearer idea.

64
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:07,796
And probably, the fact
that we don't know that is why, so often,

65
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,085
although we seek happiness,
it seems we turn our back to it.

66
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,904
Although we want to avoid suffering,

67
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,064
it seems we are running
somewhat towards it.

68
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,024
And that can also come
from some kind of confusions.

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,390
One of the most common ones
is happiness and pleasure.

70
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:27,396
But if you look at
the characteristics of those two,

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,658
pleasure is contingent upon time,
upon its object,

72
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,080
upon the place.

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It is something that -- changes of nature.

74
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,377
Beautiful chocolate cake:
first serving is delicious,

75
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:46,378
second one not so much,
then we feel disgust.

76
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:49,177
(Laughter)

77
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,724
That's the nature of things.

78
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,948
We get tired.

79
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,100
I used to be a fan of Bach.

80
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,125
I used to play it on the guitar, you know.

81
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,958
I can hear it two, three, five times.

82
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:03,494
If I had to hear it 24 hours,
non-stop, it might be very tiring.

83
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,872
If you are feeling very cold,
you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.

84
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,412
After some moments,
you just go a little back,

85
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,757
and then it starts burning.

86
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,976
It sort of uses itself
as you experience it.

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,796
And also, again, it can --
also, it's something that you --

88
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,011
it is not something
that is radiating outside.

89
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,301
Like, you can feel intense pleasure

90
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,275
and some others around you
can be suffering a lot.

91
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:34,796
Now, what, then, will be happiness?

92
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,702
And happiness, of course, is such
a vague word, so let's say well-being.

93
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:45,560
And so, I think the best definition,
according to the Buddhist view,

94
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:51,138
is that well-being is not just
a mere pleasurable sensation.

95
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,868
It is a deep sense
of serenity and fulfillment.

96
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:05,217
A state that actually pervades

97
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,962
and underlies all emotional states,

98
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,851
and all the joys and sorrows
that can come one's way.

99
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:15,431
For you, that might be surprising.

100
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,312
Can we have this kind of well-being
while being sad?

101
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,294
In a way, why not?

102
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:23,820
Because we are speaking
of a different level.

103
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,712
Look at the waves coming near the shore.

104
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,551
When you are at the bottom
of the wave, you hit the bottom.

105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,421
You hit the solid rock.

106
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,090
When you are surfing on the top,
you are all elated.

107
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:42,001
So you go from elation
to depression -- there's no depth.

108
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,581
Now, if you look at the high sea,

109
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:50,028
there might be beautiful,
calm ocean, like a mirror.

110
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,475
There might be storms,

111
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,829
but the depth of the ocean
is still there, unchanged.

112
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,796
So now, how is that?

113
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,561
It can only be a state of being,
not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.

114
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:08,331
Even joy -- that can be
the spring of happiness.

115
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:11,885
But there's also wicked joy,
you can rejoice in someone's suffering.

116
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,590
So how do we proceed
in our quest for happiness?

117
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,737
Very often, we look outside.

118
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,734
We think that if we could gather
this and that, all the conditions,

119
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:28,796
something that we say,
"Everything to be happy --

120
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,076
to have everything to be happy."

121
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,516
That very sentence already reveals
the doom, destruction of happiness.

122
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,795
To have everything.

123
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,042
If we miss something, it collapses.

124
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:44,444
And also, when things go wrong,
we try to fix the outside so much,

125
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:49,980
but our control
of the outer world is limited,

126
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,869
temporary, and often, illusory.

127
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:56,884
So now, look at inner conditions.

128
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,309
Aren't they stronger?

129
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,098
Isn't it the mind that translates

130
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:03,611
the outer condition
into happiness and suffering?

131
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,796
And isn't that stronger?

132
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,569
We know, by experience,

133
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,927
that we can be
what we call "a little paradise,"

134
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:13,960
and yet, be completely unhappy within.

135
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,008
The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,

136
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,796
and there was a lot of construction
going on everywhere.

137
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
So one evening, he said,
"Look, you are doing all these things,

138
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:26,796
but isn't it nice, also,
to build something within?"

139
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,796
And he said, "[Without] that --
even if you get a high-tech flat

140
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,070
on the 100th floor of a super-modern
and comfortable building,

141
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:38,796
if you are deeply unhappy within,

142
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
all you are going to look for
is a window from which to jump."

143
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,796
So now, at the opposite,

144
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,256
we know a lot of people who,
in very difficult circumstances,

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,651
manage to keep serenity, inner strength,
inner freedom, confidence.

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,059
So now, if the inner conditions
are stronger --

147
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,706
of course, the outer
conditions do influence,

148
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,314
and it's wonderful to live
longer, healthier,

149
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,131
to have access to information, education,

150
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,108
to be able to travel, to have freedom.

151
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,325
It's highly desirable.

152
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:14,908
However, this is not enough.

153
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:19,268
Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.

154
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:23,602
The experience that translates
everything is within the mind.

155
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:25,988
So then, when we ask oneself

156
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:30,392
how to nurture
the condition for happiness,

157
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:35,860
the inner conditions, and which are those
which will undermine happiness.

158
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,604
So then, this just needs
to have some experience.

159
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,064
We have to know from ourselves,
there are certain states of mind

160
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:46,397
that are conducive to this flourishing,
to this well-being,

161
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:49,010
what the Greeks called
eudaimonia, flourishing.

162
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,376
There are some which are adverse
to this well-being.

163
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:59,124
And so, if we look
from our own experience,

164
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:03,357
anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,

165
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:08,146
obsessive desire, strong grasping,

166
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,923
they don't leave us in such a good state
after we have experienced it.

167
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:15,517
And also, they are detrimental
to others' happiness.

168
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,506
So we may consider that the more
those are invading our mind,

169
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,181
and, like a chain reaction,

170
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,438
the more we feel miserable,
we feel tormented.

171
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,909
At the opposite,
everyone knows deep within

172
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,132
that an act of selfless generosity,

173
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:37,441
if from the distance, without anyone
knowing anything about it,

174
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:41,667
we could save a child's life,
make someone happy.

175
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:45,241
We don't need the recognition.
We don't need any gratitude.

176
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,986
Just the mere fact of doing that

177
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,743
fills such a sense of adequation
with our deep nature.

178
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,626
And we would like to be
like that all the time.

179
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,401
So is that possible,

180
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:01,025
to change our way of being,
to transform one's mind?

181
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,796
Aren't those negative emotions,
or destructive emotions,

182
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,906
inherent to the nature of mind?

183
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,890
Is change possible in our emotions,
in our traits, in our moods?

184
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,262
For that we have to ask,
what is the nature of mind?

185
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:22,294
And if we look from
the experiential point of view,

186
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,796
there is a primary
quality of consciousness

187
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,313
that's just the mere fact
to be cognitive, to be aware.

188
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,480
Consciousness is like a mirror
that allows all images to rise on it.

189
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,954
You can have ugly faces,
beautiful faces in the mirror.

190
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:41,450
The mirror allows that,
but the mirror is not tainted,

191
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:44,875
is not modified,
is not altered by those images.

192
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,753
Likewise, behind every single thought

193
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:52,869
there is the bare consciousness,
pure awareness.

194
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:54,942
This is the nature.

195
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:59,567
It cannot be tainted intrinsically
with hatred or jealousy because then,

196
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:01,198
if it was always there --

197
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:05,126
like a dye that would permeate
the whole cloth --

198
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,018
then it would be found
all the time, somewhere.

199
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:11,895
We know we're not always angry,
always jealous, always generous.

200
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,796
So, because the basic
fabric of consciousness

201
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,112
is this pure cognitive quality
that differentiates it from a stone,

202
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,383
there is a possibility for change
because all emotions are fleeting.

203
00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:26,098
That is the ground for mind training.

204
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,634
Mind training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors

205
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,483
cannot happen at the same time.

206
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:35,872
You could go from love to hate.

207
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:39,113
But you cannot, at the same time,
toward the same object,

208
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:42,516
the same person, want to harm
and want to do good.

209
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,263
You cannot, in the same gesture,
shake hand and give a blow.

210
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,507
So, there are natural
antidotes to emotions

211
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,927
that are destructive
to our inner well-being.

212
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:56,288
So that's the way to proceed.

213
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,607
Rejoicing compared to jealousy.

214
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,630
A kind of sense of inner freedom

215
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:06,356
as opposite to intense
grasping and obsession.

216
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:11,925
Benevolence, loving kindness
against hatred.

217
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,805
But, of course, each emotion then
would need a particular antidote.

218
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,796
Another way is to try to find
a general antidote to all emotions,

219
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,946
and that's by looking at the very nature.

220
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,159
Usually, when we feel annoyed,
hatred or upset with someone,

221
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,476
or obsessed with something,

222
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,034
the mind goes again
and again to that object.

223
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,884
Each time it goes to the object,

224
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,963
it reinforces that obsession
or that annoyance.

225
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:44,806
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.

226
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,294
So what we need to look for now is,

227
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,907
instead of looking outward,
we look inward.

228
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,004
Look at anger itself.

229
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:53,566
It looks very menacing,

230
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,028
like a billowing monsoon cloud
or thunderstorm.

231
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,740
We think we could sit on the cloud,

232
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,820
but if you go there, it's just mist.

233
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:06,287
Likewise, if you look
at the thought of anger,

234
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,500
it will vanish like frost
under the morning sun.

235
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,057
If you do this again
and again, the propensity,

236
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,796
the tendencies for anger to arise again

237
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,674
will be less and less
each time you dissolve it.

238
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,182
And, at the end, although it may rise,

239
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,796
it will just cross the mind,

240
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,491
like a bird crossing the sky
without leaving any track.

241
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,666
So this is the principal of mind training.

242
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:33,523
Now, it takes time,

243
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:40,518
because it took time for all those faults
in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,

244
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,796
so it will take time
to unfold them as well.

245
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:44,796
But that's the only way to go.

246
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:49,058
Mind transformation --
that is the very meaning of meditation.

247
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,796
It means familiarization
with a new way of being,

248
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,474
new way of perceiving things,

249
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:56,796
which is more in adequation with reality,

250
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,796
with interdependence, with the stream
and continuous transformation,

251
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,966
which our being and our consciousness is.

252
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,756
So, the interface with cognitive science,

253
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,940
since we need to come to that,
it was, I suppose, the subject of --

254
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:12,488
we have to deal in such a short time --
with brain plasticity.

255
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,485
The brain was thought
to be more or less fixed.

256
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:18,151
All the nominal connections,
in numbers and quantities,

257
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,116
were thought, until the last 20 years,

258
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,607
to be more or less fixed
when we reached adult age.

259
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:27,796
Now, recently, it has been found
that it can change a lot.

260
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:32,217
A violinist, as we heard, who has done
10,000 hours of violin practice,

261
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:37,062
some area that controls the movements
of fingers in the brain changes a lot,

262
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:40,038
increasing reinforcement
of the synaptic connections.

263
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,394
So can we do that with human qualities?

264
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:48,145
With loving kindness,
with patience, with openness?

265
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,936
So that's what those great
meditators have been doing.

266
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:56,548
Some of them who came to the labs,

267
00:15:56,572 --> 00:16:00,472
like in Madison, Wisconsin,
or in Berkeley,

268
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:03,786
did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.

269
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,124
They do, like, three years' retreat,
where they do meditate 12 hours a day.

270
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,608
And then, the rest of their life,
they will do three or four hours a day.

271
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:14,609
They are real Olympic
champions of mind training.

272
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,134
(Laughter)

273
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:21,478
This is the place where the meditators --
you can see it's kind of inspiring.

274
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:25,189
Now, here with 256 electrodes.

275
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:30,329
(Laughter)

276
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:31,897
So what did they find?

277
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:34,796
Of course, same thing.

278
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,517
The scientific embargo --

279
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,715
if it's ever submitted to "Nature,"
hopefully, it will be accepted.

280
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:45,057
It deals with the state of compassion,
unconditional compassion.

281
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,796
We asked meditators, who have
been doing that for years and years,

282
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,513
to put their mind in a state
where there's nothing but loving kindness,

283
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,513
total availability to sentient being.

284
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,597
Of course, during the training,
we do that with objects.

285
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,907
We think of people suffering,
of people we love,

286
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,945
but at some point, it can be
a state which is all pervading.

287
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:07,503
Here is the preliminary result,

288
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,857
which I can show
because it's already been shown.

289
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:14,781
The bell curve shows 150 controls,

290
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:16,994
and what is being looked at

291
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,386
is the difference between the right
and the left frontal lobe.

292
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,245
In very short, people
who have more activity

293
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:25,932
in the right side of the prefrontal cortex

294
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,949
are more depressed, withdrawn.

295
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:32,082
They don't describe
a lot of positive affect.

296
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,760
It's the opposite on the left side:

297
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,796
more tendency to altruism,

298
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,959
to happiness, to express,
and curiosity and so forth.

299
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:46,650
So there's a basic line for people.
And also, it can be changed.

300
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,198
If you see a comic movie,
you go off to the left side.

301
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:52,638
If you are happy about something,
you'll go more to the left side.

302
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,567
If you have a bout of depression,
you'll go to the right side.

303
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:02,076
Here, the -0.5 is the full
standard deviation

304
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,796
of a meditator
who meditated on compassion.

305
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,645
It's something that is totally out
of the bell curve.

306
00:18:08,952 --> 00:18:12,796
So, I've no time to go
into all the different scientific results.

307
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,358
Hopefully, they will come.

308
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,153
But they found that --
this is after three and a half hours

309
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,120
in an fMRI,

310
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:22,237
it's like coming out of a space ship.

311
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,796
Also, it has been shown in other labs --

312
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,796
for instance,
Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --

313
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,355
that some meditators are able, also,

314
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,796
to control their emotional response
more than it could be thought.

315
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,232
Like the startle experiments, for example.

316
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:39,787
If you sit a guy on a chair

317
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,240
with all this apparatus
measuring your physiology,

318
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,232
and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,

319
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,796
it's such an instinctive response that,

320
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,412
in 20 years, they never saw
anyone who would not jump.

321
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:53,796
Some meditators,
without trying to stop it,

322
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,194
but simply by being completely open,

323
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:01,796
thinking that that bang is just going
to be a small event like a shooting star,

324
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,457
they are able not to move at all.

325
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,796
So the whole point of that is not,
sort of, to make, like,

326
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,621
a circus thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump, or whatever.

327
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:17,492
It's more to say
that mind training matters.

328
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:21,294
That this is not just a luxury.

329
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,716
This is not a supplementary
vitamin for the soul.

330
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,472
This is something
that's going to determine

331
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,557
the quality of every instant of our lives.

332
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:35,201
We are ready to spend 15 years
achieving education.

333
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,796
We love to do jogging, fitness.

334
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,741
We do all kinds of things
to remain beautiful.

335
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:49,709
Yet, we spend surprisingly little time
taking care of what matters most --

336
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,977
the way our mind functions --

337
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:55,748
which, again, is the ultimate thing

338
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,938
that determines
the quality of our experience.

339
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:01,310
Now, compassion
is supposed to be put in action.

340
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,131
That's what we try to do
in different places.

341
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,471
Just this one example
is worth a lot of work.

342
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,998
This lady with bone TB,
left alone in a tent,

343
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,753
was going to die with her only daughter.

344
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,429
One year later, how she is.

345
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,273
Different schools and clinics
we've been doing in Tibet.

346
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,505
And just, I leave you
with the beauty of those looks

347
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,538
that tells more about happiness
than I could ever say.

348
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:35,705
(Laughter)

349
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,189
And jumping monks of Tibet.

350
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:38,796
(Laughter)

351
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,468
Flying monks.

352
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:48,960
Thank you very much.
