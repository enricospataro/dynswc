1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
In his inaugural address,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,820
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,820
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
But what did he appeal to?

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
and tell us to just go shopping.

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Invest, invest, invest."

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
And he appealed to virtue.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
And besides, some of you might be wondering,

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
what the hell does it mean?

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Let me begin with an example.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
This is the job description of a hospital janitor

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
that is scrolling up on the screen.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
They're the things you would expect:

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,820
mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
It may be a little surprising how many things there are,

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
but it's not surprising what they are.

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
even though this is a very long list,

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Not one.

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,820
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
they encountered Mike,

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,820
trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,820
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition

35
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
because there were some family members who were there all day, every day

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
And then there was Luke,

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,820
because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
didn't see Luke do it the first time,

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
and his father was angry.

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,820
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
doesn't just make people feel a little better,

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
it actually improves the quality of patient care

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
and enables hospitals to run well.

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,820
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
involving kindness, care and empathy

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
are an essential part of the job.

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,820
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.

54
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,820
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,820
"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."

57
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:48,820
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,

58
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,820
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.

59
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,820
A wise person knows how to improvise,

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
and the context is always changing.

63
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
A wise person is like a jazz musician --

64
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,

65
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,820
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills

67
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
in the service of the right aims.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And finally, perhaps most important,

70
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
a wise person is made, not born.

71
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Wisdom depends on experience,

72
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
and not just any experience.

73
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.

74
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
You need permission to be allowed to improvise,

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,820
try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.

77
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described

78
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
how hard it is to learn to do their job,

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,820
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.

81
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,820
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.

82
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
At TED, brilliance is rampant.

83
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
It's scary.

84
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,820
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,820
The bad news is that without wisdom,

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
brilliance isn't enough.

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,820
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.

88
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
(Applause)

89
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Now, I hope that we all know this.

90
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
There's a sense in which it's obvious,

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
and yet, let me tell you a little story.

92
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
It's a story about lemonade.

93
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,820
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.

94
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
His son asked him for some lemonade

95
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.

96
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,

97
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
which was five percent alcohol.

98
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.

99
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
So he brought it back.

100
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
and called the police, who called an ambulance

102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.

103
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,820
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.

104
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
And they were ready to let the kid go.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
But not so fast.

106
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.

107
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,820
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
At that point, can the child go home?

109
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.

110
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
After two weeks, I'm happy to report,

111
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
the family was reunited.

112
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people

113
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
and the judge all said the same thing:

114
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,820
"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."

115
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
How do things like this happen?

116
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,

117
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,820
said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,

118
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
but they spare you from thinking."

119
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed

120
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
because previous officials have been lax

121
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
and they let a child go back to an abusive household.

122
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Fair enough.

123
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
When things go wrong, as of course they do,

124
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
we reach for two tools to try to fix them.

125
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
One tool we reach for is rules.

126
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Better ones, more of them.

127
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
The second tool we reach for is incentives.

128
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Better ones, more of them.

129
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
What else, after all, is there?

130
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,820
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.

131
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Regulate, regulate, regulate.

132
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...

133
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives

134
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
are enough to do the job.

135
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,820
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?

136
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?

137
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
It's preposterous on its face.

138
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,820
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,

139
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,820
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,

140
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
but they create a downward spiral

141
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
that makes them worse in the long run.

142
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules

143
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
that deprives us of the opportunity

144
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
to improvise and learn from our improvisations.

145
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
And moral will is undermined

146
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
by an incessant appeal to incentives

147
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
that destroy our desire to do the right thing.

148
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
And without intending it,

149
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,820
by appealing to rules and incentives,

150
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
we are engaging in a war on wisdom.

151
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Let me just give you a few examples,

152
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
first of rules and the war on moral skill.

153
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
The lemonade story is one.

154
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Second, no doubt more familiar to you,

155
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
is the nature of modern American education:

156
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
scripted, lock-step curricula.

157
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.

158
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Reading and enjoying literature

159
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
and words that begin with 'B.'

160
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug

161
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.

162
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.

163
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,

164
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,820
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.

165
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,820
We know why these scripts are there.

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough

167
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
to let them loose on their own.

168
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.

169
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
And they prevent disaster.

170
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,820
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.

171
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:26,820
(Applause)

172
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Don't get me wrong. We need rules!

173
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Jazz musicians need some notes --

174
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
most of them need some notes on the page.

175
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.

176
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,820
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians

177
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
from improvising.

178
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
And as a result, they lose their gifts,

179
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
or worse, they stop playing altogether.

180
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Now, how about incentives?

181
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
They seem cleverer.

182
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
If you have one reason for doing something

183
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,

184
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one

185
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
and you're more likely to do it.

186
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Right?

187
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Well, not always.

188
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another

189
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
instead of complimenting,

190
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
and they make people less likely to do it.

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.

192
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,

193
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.

194
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
There was going to be a national referendum.

195
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.

196
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

197
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.

198
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
They knew it was dangerous.

199
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
They thought it would reduce their property values.

200
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
But it had to go somewhere

201
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
and they had responsibilities as citizens.

202
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,820
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.

203
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year

204
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,820
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.

206
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Instead of 50 percent saying yes,

207
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
25 percent said yes.

208
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
What happens is that

209
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,820
the second this introduction of incentive gets us

210
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"

211
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"

212
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
When incentives don't work,

213
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies

214
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,

215
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
the response is always the same.

216
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Get smarter incentives.

217
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise

218
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
that are ever going to be smart enough.

219
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.

220
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,820
We need incentives. People have to make a living.

221
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
But excessive reliance on incentives

222
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
demoralizes professional activity

223
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
in two senses of that word.

224
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale

225
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.

226
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,

227
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,820
"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"

228
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
And when professions are demoralized,

229
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,820
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives

230
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
and they stop asking "Is it right?"

231
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
We see this in medicine.

232
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,820
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")

233
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
And we certainly see it in the world of business.

234
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,820
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")

235
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,820
("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")

236
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.

237
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
So what can we do?

238
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
A few sources of hope:

239
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
we ought to try to re-moralize work.

240
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,820
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.

241
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
(Applause)

242
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious

243
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics

244
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,820
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.

245
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
What to do instead?

246
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,820
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.

247
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Acknowledge, when you go to law school,

248
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
that a little voice is whispering in your ear

249
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
about Atticus Finch.

250
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.

251
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
People are inspired by moral heroes.

252
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
But we learn that with sophistication

253
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,820
comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.

254
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Well, acknowledge them.

255
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Be proud that you have them.

256
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Celebrate them.

257
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.

258
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
That's one thing we can do.

259
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
I don't know how many of you remember this:

260
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,820
another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,

261
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --

262
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
they made Polartec --

263
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
The factory burned down.

264
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.

265
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them

266
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
and for the community if he had let them go.

267
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,820
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,

268
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,820
but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."

269
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.

270
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
Two were particularly inspiring to me.

271
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --

272
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
(Applause)

273
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire

274
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.

275
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.

276
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
And a bonus he's discovering is

277
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
he's actually going to make even more money.

278
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
His employees are inspired by the effort.

279
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.

280
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.

281
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
(Applause)

282
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
In many ways this is the perfect example.

283
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Because it took the will to do the right thing.

284
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.

285
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know

286
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
in order to plot this out.

287
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
But most important to make it work --

288
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
and he emphasized this --

289
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
is that it took knowing the people in the communities.

290
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Unless the people you're working with are behind you,

291
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
this will fail.

292
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,

293
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
because different people in different communities

294
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
organize their lives in different ways.

295
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.

296
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.

297
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
There are ordinary heroes.

298
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.

299
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive

300
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.

301
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
As heads of organizations,

302
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
we should strive to create environments

303
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,820
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.

304
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people

305
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
will give up if they have to swim against the current

306
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
in the organizations in which they work.

307
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
If you run an organization, you should be sure

308
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --

309
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.

310
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Because the truth is that

311
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people

312
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
is moral work.

313
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,820
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.

314
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
And, perhaps most important,

315
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,

316
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,820
the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.

317
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.

318
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,820
One is that we are always teaching.

319
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Someone is always watching.

320
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
The camera is always on.

321
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education

322
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:

323
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
"Knowledge is power."

324
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things

325
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
that KIPP is doing

326
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,820
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.

327
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing

328
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
that Bill didn't mention.

329
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
That is that they have come to the realization

330
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
that the single most important thing kids need to learn

331
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
is character.

332
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
They need to learn to respect themselves.

333
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.

334
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
They need to learn to respect their teachers.

335
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.

336
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
That's the principle objective.

337
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,820
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.

338
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids

339
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,820
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.

340
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Obama appealed to virtue.

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
And I think he was right.

342
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,820
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,

343
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:27,820
because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --

344
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.

345
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
He also appealed to hope.

346
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
Right again.

347
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
I think there is reason for hope.

348
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.

349
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,820
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.

350
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Wanting to do the right thing

351
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
in the right way

352
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
for the right reasons.

353
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us

354
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,820
if only we start paying attention.

355
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Paying attention to what we do,

356
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
to how we do it,

357
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
and, perhaps most importantly,

358
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
to the structure of the organizations within which we work,

359
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,820
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom

360
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,820
rather than having it suppressed.

361
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Thank you very much.

362
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Thank you.

363
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,820
(Applause)

364
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.

365
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.

366
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,820
(Applause)
