1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,077
The President: Good
afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:06,280
Yesterday was
a historic day.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,060
The comprehensive, long-term
deal that we achieved with

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,930
our allies and partners to
prevent Iran from obtaining

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,750
a nuclear weapon represents
a powerful display of

6
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:18,077
American leadership
and diplomacy.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,799
It shows what we can
accomplish when we lead from

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,025
a position of strength and a
position of principle, when

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,294
we unite the international
community around a shared

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:34,318
vision, and we resolve to
solve problems peacefully.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,603
As I said yesterday, it's
important for the American

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,620
people and Congress to get a
full opportunity to review

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,774
this deal.

14
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,809
That process is
now underway.

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,211
I've already reached out to
leaders in Congress on both

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,613
sides of the aisle.

17
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,417
My national security team
has begun offering

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,818
extensive briefings.

19
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,721
I expect the debate to be
robust -- and that's

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,722
how it should be.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,723
This is an important issue.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,259
Our national security
policies are stronger and

23
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,895
more effective when they are
subject to the scrutiny and

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,564
transparency that
democracy demands.

25
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,535
And as I said yesterday, the
details of this deal matter

26
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,303
very much.

27
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,274
That's why our team worked
so hard for so long to get

28
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,810
the details right.

29
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,017
At the same time, as this
debate unfolds, I hope we

30
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,615
don't lose sight of the
larger picture -- the

31
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,220
opportunity that this
agreement represents.

32
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:29,057
As we go forward, it's
important for everybody to

33
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,626
remember the alternative and
the fundamental choice that

34
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,929
this moment represents.

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,266
With this deal, we cut off
every single one of Iran's

36
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:44,938
pathways to a nuclear
program -- a nuclear weapons

37
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,843
program, and Iran's nuclear
program will be under severe

38
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,246
limits for many years.

39
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,333
Without a deal, those
pathways remain open; there

40
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:01,054
would be no limits on Iran's
nuclear program, and Iran

41
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,131
could move closer
to a nuclear bomb.

42
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,628
With this deal, we
gain unprecedented,

43
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,564
around-the-clock monitoring
of Iran's key nuclear

44
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,168
facilities and the most
comprehensive and intrusive

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,206
inspection and verification
regime ever negotiated.

46
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,310
Without a deal, those
inspections go away, and we

47
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,667
lose the ability to closely
monitor Iran's program and

48
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,317
detect any covert
nuclear weapons program.

49
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,722
With this deal, if Iran
violates its commitments,

50
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,658
there will be real
consequences.

51
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,994
Nuclear-related sanctions
that have helped to cripple

52
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,231
the Iranian economy will
snap back into place.

53
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,233
Without a deal, the
international sanctions

54
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,637
regime will unravel,
with little ability

55
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,273
to re-impose them.

56
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,842
With this deal, we have the
possibility of peacefully

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,845
resolving a major threat to
regional and international

58
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,947
security.

59
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,585
Without a deal, we risk even
more war in the Middle East,

60
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,620
and other countries in the
region would feel compelled

61
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,129
to pursue their own nuclear
programs, threatening a

62
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,866
nuclear arms race in the
most volatile region

63
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,729
in the world.

64
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,333
As I said yesterday, even
with this deal, we will

65
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,504
continue to have profound
differences with Iran -- its

66
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,739
support for terrorism and
its use of proxies to

67
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,376
destabilize parts
of the Middle East.

68
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,473
Therefore, the multilateral
arms embargo on Iran will

69
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,403
remain in place for an
additional five years, and

70
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,118
restrictions on ballistic
missile technology will

71
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,021
remain for eight years.

72
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,038
In addition, the United
States will maintain our own

73
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,268
sanctions related to Iran's
support for terrorism, its

74
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,263
ballistic missile program,
and its human rights

75
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,764
violations.

76
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,500
And we'll continue our
unprecedented security

77
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,209
cooperation with Israel
and continue to deepen our

78
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,706
partnerships with
the Gulf States.

79
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:05,612
But the bottom line is this:
This nuclear deal meets the

80
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,114
national security interests
of the United States

81
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,682
and our allies.

82
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,286
It prevents the most serious
threat -- Iran obtaining a

83
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,323
nuclear weapon, which would
only make the other problems

84
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:21,327
that Iran may
cause even worse.

85
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,374
That's why this deal makes
our country, and the world,

86
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,300
safer and more secure.

87
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:30,807
It's why the alternative --
no limits on Iran's nuclear

88
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,040
program, no inspections,
an Iran that's closer to a

89
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:38,175
nuclear weapon, the risk of
a regional nuclear arms race

90
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:42,782
and a greater risk of
war -- all that would

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
endanger our security.

92
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,019
That's the choice
that we face.

93
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,221
If we don't choose wisely, I
believe future generations

94
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,890
will judge us harshly
for letting this moment

95
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,625
slip away.

96
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,663
And no one suggests that
this deal resolves all the

97
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,700
threats that Iran poses to
its neighbors or the world.

98
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,310
Moreover, realizing the
promise of this deal will

99
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,272
require many years
of implementation

100
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,273
and hard work.

101
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,344
It will require
vigilance and execution.

102
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,647
But this deal is our best
means of assuring that Iran

103
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,916
does not get a
nuclear weapon.

104
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,453
And, from the start, that
has been my number-one

105
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,256
priority, our
number-one priority.

106
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,894
We've got a historic chance
to pursue a safer and more

107
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,230
secure world -- an
opportunity that may not

108
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,526
come again in our lifetimes.

109
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,502
As President and as
Commander-in-Chief, I am

110
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,173
determined to seize
that opportunity.

111
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,342
So with that, I'm going
to take some questions.

112
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,179
And let me see who I'm
starting off with.

113
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,020
Here you go.

114
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:54,769
I got it.

115
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,789
(laughter)

116
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,728
Andrew Beatty, AFP.

117
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,563
The Press: Thank
you, Mr. President.

118
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,600
Yesterday, you said the deal
offered a chance at a new

119
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,602
direction in
relations with Iran.

120
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,669
What steps will you take to
enable a more moderate Iran?

121
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,777
And does this deal allow you
to more forcefully counter

122
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,814
Iran's destabilizing actions
in the region quite aside

123
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,281
from the nuclear question?

124
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,583
Thank you.

125
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,019
The President: Andrew, if
you don't mind, just because

126
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,456
I suspect that there's
going to be a common set of

127
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,093
questions that are touched
on -- I promise I will get

128
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,896
to your question, but I
want to start off just by

129
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:42,001
stepping back and reminding
folks of what is at stake

130
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,002
here.

131
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,004
And I already did in my
opening statement, but I

132
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,006
just want to reiterate it
because I've heard already

133
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,975
some of the objections
to the deal.

134
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:58,050
The starting premise of our
strategy with respect to

135
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:03,177
Iran has been that it would
be a grave threat to the

136
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,159
United States and to our
allies if they obtained a

137
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,161
nuclear weapon.

138
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,775
And so everything that we've
done over the last six and a

139
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:17,703
half years has been designed
to make sure that we address

140
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,705
that number-one priority.

141
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,045
That's what the sanctions
regime was all about.

142
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:30,116
That's how we were able to
mobilize the international

143
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,652
community, including some
folks that we are not

144
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,154
particularly close to, to
abide by these sanctions.

145
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,491
That's how these crippling
sanctions came about, was

146
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:42,862
because we were able to gain
global consensus that Iran

147
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,498
having a nuclear weapon
would be a problem for

148
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,500
everybody.

149
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:50,208
That's the reason that
Iran's accounts got frozen

150
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,974
and they were not able to
get money for the oil sales

151
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,209
that they've made.

152
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,445
That's the reason that they
had problems operating with

153
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,781
respect to international
commerce -- because we built

154
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,585
that international consensus
around this very specific,

155
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,956
narrow, but profound issue
-- the possibility of Iran

156
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,725
getting a nuclear weapon.

157
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,294
And, by the way, that was
not simply my priority.

158
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,098
If you look back at all the
debates that have taken

159
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:24,470
place over the last five,
six years, this has been a

160
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,183
Democratic priority, this
has been a Republican

161
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,875
priority, this has been
Prime Minister Netanyahu's

162
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,543
priority.

163
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,979
It's been our Gulf allies'
priority -- is making sure

164
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,981
Iran does not get
a nuclear weapon.

165
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:42,255
The deal negotiated by John
Kerry, Wendy Sherman, Ernie

166
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:48,394
Moniz, our allies, our
partners, the P5+1

167
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,396
achieves that goal.

168
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,068
It achieves our top priority
-- making sure that Iran

169
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,070
does not get a
nuclear weapon.

170
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:05,611
But we have always
recognized that even if Iran

171
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:11,517
doesn't get a nuclear
weapon, Iran still poses

172
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:17,123
challenges to our interests
and our values, both in the

173
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,125
region and around the world.

174
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:28,834
So when this deal gets
implemented, we know that we

175
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:34,840
will have dismantled the
immediate concerns around

176
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,780
Iran's nuclear program.

177
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,981
We will have brought their
stockpiles down to 98

178
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,684
percent.

179
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,887
We will have significantly
reduced the number of

180
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,322
centrifuges that
they operate.

181
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,159
We will have installed an
unprecedented inspections

182
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,797
regime, and that will remain
in place not just for 10

183
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,200
years but, for example,
on the stockpiles, will

184
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,037
continue to 15 years.

185
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,272
Iran will have pledged to
the international community

186
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,108
that it will not develop a
nuclear weapon and now will

187
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:16,582
be subject to an Additional
Protocol, a more vigorous

188
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,518
inspection and monitoring
regime that lasts in

189
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,520
perpetuity.

190
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:28,561
We will have disabled a
facility like Arak, the Arak

191
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:35,267
facility, from allowing Iran
to develop plutonium that

192
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,203
could be used for a bomb.

193
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:42,742
We will have greatly reduced
the stockpile of uranium

194
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,944
that's enriched.

195
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,280
And we will have put in
place inspections along the

196
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:53,534
entire supply chain so that
if uranium was diverted into

197
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,723
a covert program
we would catch it.

198
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,594
So I can say with confidence
but, more importantly,

199
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,432
nuclear experts can say with
confidence that Iran will

200
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:11,404
not be in a position to
develop a nuclear bomb.

201
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,406
We will have met our
number-one priority.

202
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:19,278
Now, we'll still have
problems with Iran's

203
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,083
sponsorship of terrorism;
its funding of proxies like

204
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,987
Hezbollah that threaten
Israel and threaten the

205
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,823
region; the destabilizing
activities that they're

206
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,900
engaging in, including
in places like Yemen.

207
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:40,599
And my hope is that building
on this deal we can continue

208
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:48,441
to have conversations with
Iran that incentivize them

209
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,546
to behave differently in
the region, to be less

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,050
aggressive, less hostile,
more cooperative, to operate

211
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:03,444
the way we expect nations in
the international community

212
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,490
to behave.

213
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,151
But we're not
counting on it.

214
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,029
So this deal is not
contingent on Iran changing

215
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,030
its behavior.

216
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:15,841
It's not contingent on Iran
suddenly operating like a

217
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,070
liberal democracy.

218
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,610
It solves one particular
problem, which is making

219
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,675
sure they don't have a bomb.

220
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,245
And the point I've
repeatedly made -- and is, I

221
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:30,516
believe, hard to dispute --
is that it will be a lot

222
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,588
easier for us to check
Iran's nefarious activities,

223
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,693
to push back against the
other areas where they

224
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,728
operate contrary to our
interests or our allies'

225
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:47,199
interests, if they
don't have a bomb.

226
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:53,706
And so will they
change their behavior?

227
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:59,445
Will we seek to gain more
cooperation from them in

228
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,183
resolving issues like Syria,
or what's happening in Iraq,

229
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,386
to stop encouraging
Houthis in Yemen?

230
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,588
We'll continue to
engage with them.

231
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,425
Although, keep in mind that
unlike the Cuba situation,

232
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,928
we're not normalizing
diplomatic relations here.

233
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,965
So the contacts will
continue to be limited.

234
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,501
But will we try to encourage
them to take a more

235
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,502
constructive path?

236
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,503
Of course.

237
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,906
But we're not betting on it.

238
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,809
And in fact, having resolved
the nuclear issue, we will

239
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,980
be in a stronger position to
work with Israel, work with

240
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,334
the Gulf countries, work
with our other partners,

241
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,554
work with the Europeans to
bring additional pressure to

242
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,190
bear on Iran around those
issues that remain of

243
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,221
concern.

244
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,928
But the argument that I've
been already hearing -- and

245
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,930
this was foreshadowed
even before the deal was

246
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:54,697
announced -- that because
this deal does not solve all

247
00:13:55,534 --> 00:14:00,206
those other problems, that
that's an argument for

248
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:05,844
rejecting this
deal, defies logic.

249
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,813
It makes no sense.

250
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,453
And it loses sight of what
was our original number-one

251
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,500
priority, which is making
sure that they don't have a

252
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:18,924
bomb.

253
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,726
Jon Karl.

254
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:26,865
The Press: Mr. President,
does it give you any pause

255
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,868
to see this deal praised by
Syrian dictator Assad as a

256
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:34,440
"great victory for Iran," or
praised by those in Tehran

257
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,746
who still shout "death
to America," and yet our

258
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,545
closest ally in the Middle
East calls it "a mistake of

259
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,980
historic proportions"?

260
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:43,267
And here in Congress, it
looks like a large majority

261
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,784
will vote to
reject this deal.

262
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,721
I know you can veto that
rejection, but do you have

263
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,457
any concerns about seeing
a majority of the people's

264
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,493
representatives in
Congress saying that this

265
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,095
is a bad deal?

266
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,466
And if I can just ask you
quick political question, a

267
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,467
very quick one.

268
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,469
The President: Jon, I think
-- The Press: Donald -- The

269
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,471
President: Let me answer the
question that you asked.

270
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:13,100
It does not give me pause
that Mr. Assad or others in

271
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:23,155
Tehran may be trying to spin
the deal in a way that they

272
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,557
think is favorable to what
their constituencies want to

273
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,558
hear.

274
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,626
That's what politicians do.

275
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,530
And that's been the
case throughout.

276
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,689
I mean, you'll recall that
during the course of these

277
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,468
negotiations over the last
couple of months every time

278
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,105
the Supreme Leader or
somebody tweeted something

279
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,192
out, for some reason we all
bought into the notion,

280
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,002
well, the Obama
administration must be

281
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,247
giving this or
capitulating to that.

282
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,582
Well, now we have a
document so you can see

283
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,818
what the deal is.

284
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,820
We don't have to speculate,
we don't have to engage in

285
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:56,885
spin, you can just read
what it says and what is

286
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,158
required.

287
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,196
And nobody has disputed that
as a consequence of this

288
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:09,134
agreement Iran has to
drastically reduce its

289
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:14,373
stockpiles of uranium, is
cut off from plutonium; the

290
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:21,447
Fordow facility that is
underground is converted;

291
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,749
that we have an
unprecedented inspections

292
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,953
regime; that we have
snap-back provisions

293
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:28,921
if they cheat.

294
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,924
The facts are the facts.

295
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,991
And I'm not concerned about
what others say about it.

296
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:41,628
Now, with respect to
Congress, my hope -- I won't

297
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,031
prejudge this -- my hope is,
is that everyone in Congress

298
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:52,945
also evaluates this
agreement based on the facts

299
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:57,850
-- not on politics, not on
posturing, not on the fact

300
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:01,789
that this is a deal I bring
to Congress as opposed to a

301
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:09,495
Republican President, not
based on lobbying, but based

302
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,897
on what's in the national
interest of the United

303
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,866
States of America.

304
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,971
And I think that if Congress
does that, then, in fact,

305
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:24,443
based on the facts, the
majority of Congress should

306
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,145
approve of this deal.

307
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:31,016
But we live in Washington
and politics do intrude.

308
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,420
And as I said in an
interview yesterday, I am

309
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:40,081
not betting on the
Republican Party rallying

310
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,262
behind this agreement.

311
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:50,306
I do expect the debate to
be based on facts and not

312
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,905
speculation or
misinformation.

313
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:59,575
And that I welcome -- in
part because, look, there

314
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:04,583
are legitimate
real concerns here.

315
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,585
We've already
talked about it.

316
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:11,757
We have huge
differences with Iran.

317
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:17,831
Israel has legitimate
concerns about its security

318
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,365
relative to Iran.

319
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:26,371
You have a large country
with a significant military

320
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:31,477
that has proclaimed that
Israel shouldn't exist, that

321
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:36,081
has denied the Holocaust,
that has financed Hezbollah,

322
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,283
and as a consequence there
are missiles that are

323
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,820
pointed towards Tel Aviv.

324
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,023
And so I think there are
very good reasons why

325
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,530
Israelis are nervous about
Iran's position in the world

326
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,054
generally.

327
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,533
And I've said this to Prime
Minister Netanyahu, I've

328
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,620
said it directly to
the Israeli people.

329
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:05,511
But what I've also said is
that all those threats are

330
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:11,016
compounded if Iran
gets a nuclear weapon.

331
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:15,487
And for all the objections
of Prime Minister Netanyahu,

332
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,534
or, for that matter, some of
the Republican leadership

333
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,995
that's already spoken, none
of them have presented to

334
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:28,967
me, or the American people,
a better alternative.

335
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:36,889
I'm hearing a lot of talking
points being repeated about

336
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:42,648
"this is a bad deal" --
"this is a historically bad

337
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,051
deal," "this will threaten
Israel and threaten the

338
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,053
world and threaten
the United States."

339
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,090
I mean, there's
been a lot of that.

340
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:56,647
What I haven't heard is,
what is your preferred

341
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,730
alternative?

342
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:06,905
If 99 percent of the world
community and the majority

343
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,609
of nuclear experts look at
this thing and they say,

344
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:15,881
this will prevent Iran from
getting a nuclear bomb, and

345
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:21,019
you are arguing either that
it does not, or that even if

346
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,156
it does it's temporary, or
that because they're going

347
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:30,228
to get a windfall of their
accounts being unfrozen that

348
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:34,833
they'll cause more problems,
then you should have some

349
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,268
alternative to present.

350
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,769
And I haven't heard that.

351
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,673
And the reason is because
there really are only two

352
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,544
alternatives here: Either
the issue of Iran obtaining

353
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,847
a nuclear weapon is resolved
diplomatically through a

354
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:55,320
negotiation, or it's
resolved through force,

355
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,033
through war.

356
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,092
Those are the options.

357
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:05,998
Now, you'll hear some
critics say, well, we could

358
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,699
have negotiated
a better deal.

359
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,834
Okay.

360
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,835
What does that mean?

361
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,872
I think the suggestion among
a lot of the critics has

362
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,910
been that a better deal, an
acceptable deal would be one

363
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:24,145
in which Iran has no nuclear
capacity at all, peaceful or

364
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,948
otherwise.

365
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,457
The problem with that
position is that there is

366
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,194
nobody who thinks that Iran
would or could ever accept

367
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,666
that, and the international
community does not take the

368
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,469
view that Iran can't have a
peaceful nuclear program.

369
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,546
They agree with us
that Iran cannot have

370
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,108
a nuclear weapon.

371
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:59,151
And so we don't have
diplomatic leverage to

372
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:04,322
eliminate every vestige
of a peaceful nuclear

373
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,291
program in Iran.

374
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,026
What we do have the leverage
to do is to make sure they

375
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,028
don't have a weapon.

376
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,630
That's exactly
what we've done.

377
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:21,873
So to go back to Congress,
I challenge those who are

378
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,176
objecting to this agreement,
number one, to read the

379
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,879
agreement before they
comment on it; number two,

380
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:33,018
to explain specifically
where it is that they think

381
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,554
this agreement does not
prevent Iran from getting a

382
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,571
nuclear weapon, and why
they're right and people

383
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,660
like Ernie Moniz, who is an
MIT nuclear physicist and an

384
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:46,104
expert in these issues, is
wrong, why the rest of the

385
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,036
world is wrong, and then
present an alternative.

386
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,408
And if the alternative is
that we should bring Iran to

387
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,845
heel through military force,
then those critics should

388
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,013
say so.

389
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,717
And that will be
an honest debate.

390
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,885
All right.

391
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,519
The Press: Mr.
President, if I can --

392
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,020
The President: No, no --

393
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,337
The Press: Prime
Minister Netanyahu said that

394
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,524
you have a situation where
Iran can delay 24 days

395
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,426
before giving access to
military facilities --

396
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,195
The President: I'm happy to
-- that's a good example.

397
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,298
So let's take the
issue of 24 days.

398
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,135
This has been I think
swirling today, the notion

399
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,072
that this is insufficient
in terms of inspections.

400
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,343
Now, keep in mind, first of
all, that we'll have 24/7

401
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,981
inspections of declared
nuclear facilities --

402
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:42,454
Fordow, Natanz, Arak, their
uranium mines; facilities

403
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:47,425
that are known to produce
centrifuges, parts.

404
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:52,764
That entire infrastructure
that we know about we will

405
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,902
have sophisticated, 24/7
monitoring of those

406
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,904
facilities.

407
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,919
So then the issue is, what
if they try to develop a

408
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,846
covert program?

409
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,863
Now, one of the advantages
of having inspections across

410
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:15,854
the entire production chain
is that it makes it very

411
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,856
difficult to set up
a covert program.

412
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:23,795
There are only so many
uranium mines in Iran.

413
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,299
And if, in fact, we're
counting the amount of

414
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,902
uranium that's being mined
and suddenly some is missing

415
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,640
on the back end, they got
some explaining to do.

416
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:42,078
So we're able to track
what's happening along the

417
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:46,084
existing facilities to make
sure that there is not

418
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,187
diversion into a
covert program.

419
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,390
But let's say that Iran is
so determined that it now

420
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,041
wants to operate covertly.

421
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:01,233
The IAEA, the international
organization charged with

422
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,335
implementing the
non-proliferation treaty and

423
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,571
monitoring nuclear
activities in countries

424
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:11,810
around the world -- the IAEA
will have the ability to

425
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:14,618
say, that undeclared site
we're concerned about, we

426
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,349
see something suspicious.

427
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:23,321
And they will be able to
say to Iran, we want to go

428
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,408
inspect that.

429
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,262
Now, if Iran objects,
we can override it.

430
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:35,867
In the agreement, we've set
it up so we can override

431
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,603
Iran's objection.

432
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:44,175
And we don't need Russia or
China in order for us to get

433
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,344
that override.

434
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,581
And if they continue to
object, we're in a position

435
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,384
to snap back sanctions and
declare that Iran is in

436
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,386
violation and is cheating.

437
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,226
As for the fact that it may
take 24 days to finally get

438
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,964
access to the site, the
nature of nuclear programs

439
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,971
and facilities is such, this
is not something you hide in

440
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,035
a closet.

441
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,082
This is not something you
put on a dolly and kind of

442
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,740
wheel off somewhere.

443
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:19,879
And, by the way, if we
identify an undeclared site

444
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,882
that we're suspicious about,
we're going to be keeping

445
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,650
eyes on it.

446
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,067
So we're going to be
monitoring what the activity

447
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,323
is, and that's going to
be something that will be

448
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,625
evidence if we think that
some funny business was

449
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,362
going on there that we
can then present to the

450
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,097
international community.

451
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,566
So we'll be monitoring
that that entire time.

452
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:46,805
And, by the way, if there
is nuclear material on that

453
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:53,912
site, high school physics
will remind us that that

454
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,914
leaves a trace.

455
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,152
And so we'll know that, in
fact, there was a violation

456
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,854
of the agreement.

457
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:10,395
So the point is, Jonathan,
that this is the most

458
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,666
vigorous inspection and
verification regime by far

459
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,435
that has ever
been negotiated.

460
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:21,740
Is it possible that Iran
decides to try to cheat

461
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,577
despite having this entire
inspection verification

462
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,711
mechanism?

463
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,880
It's possible.

464
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:31,115
But if it does, first of
all, we've built in a

465
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,112
one-year breakout time,
which gives us a year to

466
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,014
respond forcefully.

467
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,166
And we've built in a
snap-back provision so we

468
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,235
don't have to go through
lengthy negotiations at the

469
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,830
U.N.

470
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,085
to put the sanctions
right back in place.

471
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,972
And so really the only
argument you can make

472
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:58,143
against the verification and
inspection mechanism that

473
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:04,207
we've put forward is that
Iran is so intent on

474
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,790
obtaining a nuclear weapon
that no inspection regime

475
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,855
and no verification
mechanism would be

476
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,858
sufficient because they'd
find some way to get around

477
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,294
it because they're
untrustworthy.

478
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,463
And if that's your view,
then we go back to the

479
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,498
choice that you have
to make earlier.

480
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,500
That means, presumably,
that you can't negotiate.

481
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,440
And what you're really
saying is, is that you've

482
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:31,111
got to apply military force
to guarantee that they don't

483
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,879
have a nuclear program.

484
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,980
And if somebody wants to
make that debate -- whether

485
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,834
it's the Republican
leadership, or Prime

486
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:42,420
Minister Netanyahu, or
the Israeli Ambassador or

487
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,311
others, they're
free to make it.

488
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,491
But it's not persuasive.

489
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,626
Carol Lee.

490
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:53,998
The Press: Thank
you, Mr. President.

491
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,067
I want to ask you about the
arms and ballistic missile

492
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,068
embargo.

493
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,271
Why did you decide -- agree
to lift those even with the

494
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,140
five- and eight-year
durations?

495
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:05,050
It's obviously emerging as a
sticking point on the Hill.

496
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,980
And are you concerned that
arms to Iran will go to

497
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:09,366
Hezbollah or Hamas?

498
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,784
And is there anything that
you or a future President

499
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,252
can do to stop that?

500
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,329
And if you don't mind, I
wanted to see if you could

501
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,029
step back a little bit, and
when you look at this Iran

502
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,195
deal and all the other
issues and unrest that's

503
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,731
happening in the Middle
East, what kind of Middle

504
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,234
East do you want to leave
when you leave the White

505
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,435
House in a year and a half?

506
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,437
The President: So the issue
of the arms embargo and

507
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:38,810
ballistic missiles is of
real concern to us -- has

508
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:39,315
been of real concern to us.

509
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:46,050
And it is in the national
security interest of the

510
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:52,390
United States to prevent
Iran from sending weapons to

511
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:57,178
Hezbollah, for example,
or sending weapons to the

512
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,734
Houthis in Yemen that
accelerate a civil war

513
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,736
there.

514
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,707
We have a number of
mechanisms under

515
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:16,414
international law that give
us authority to interdict

516
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,421
arms shipments by Iran.

517
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,288
One of those
mechanisms is the U.N.

518
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:28,059
security resolution related
to Iran's nuclear program.

519
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:35,166
Essentially, Iran was
sanctioned because of what

520
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,437
had happened at Fordow, its
unwillingness to comply with

521
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,306
previous U.N.

522
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,642
security resolutions about
their nuclear program.

523
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,669
And as part of the package
of sanctions that was

524
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:53,084
slapped on them, the issue
of arms and ballistic

525
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,085
missiles were included.

526
00:30:54,085 --> 00:31:00,119
Now, under the terms
of the original U.N.

527
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:07,332
resolution, the fact is
that once an agreement was

528
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:12,570
arrived at that gave the
international community

529
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:15,104
assurance Iran didn't have
a nuclear weapon, you could

530
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:19,041
argue just looking at the
text that those arms and

531
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,746
ballistic missile
prohibitions should

532
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,747
immediately go away.

533
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,985
But what I said to our
negotiators was given that

534
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:32,991
Iran has breached trust,
and the uncertainty of our

535
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,663
allies in the region about
Iran's activities, let's

536
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:46,504
press for a longer extension
of the arms embargo and the

537
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,139
ballistic missile
prohibitions.

538
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,008
And we got that.

539
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,945
We got five years in which,
under this new agreement,

540
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,951
arms coming in and out
of Iran are prohibited.

541
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,286
And we got eight years
with respect to ballistic

542
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,821
missiles.

543
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:10,828
But part of the reason why
we were willing to extend it

544
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,165
only for five, let's say, as
opposed to a longer period

545
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,102
of time, is because
we have other U.N.

546
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:24,275
resolutions that prohibit
arms sales by Iran to

547
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,811
organizations
like Hezbollah.

548
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,146
We have other U.N.

549
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:33,384
resolutions and multilateral
agreements that give us

550
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:38,523
authority to interdict
arms shipments from Iran

551
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,124
throughout the region.

552
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:45,363
And so we've had belts and
suspenders and buttons, a

553
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:49,100
whole bunch of different
legal authorities.

554
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:52,538
These legal authorities
under the nuclear program

555
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,873
may lapse after five or
eight years, but we'll still

556
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,940
be in possession of other
legal authorities that allow

557
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,778
us to interdict those arms.

558
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:08,486
And truthfully, these
prohibitions are not

559
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,487
self-enforcing.

560
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,488
It's not like the U.N.

561
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:16,527
has the capacity to police
what Iran is doing.

562
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,614
What it does is it
gives us authority under

563
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:25,403
international law to
prevent arms shipments from

564
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:32,977
happening in concert with
our allies and our partners.

565
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,513
And the real problem, if you
look at how, for example,

566
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:40,184
Hezbollah got a lot of
missiles that are a grave

567
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,221
threat to Israel and many of
our friends in the region,

568
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,023
it's not because
they were legal.

569
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,090
It's not because somehow
that was authorized under

570
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,694
international law.

571
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,761
It was because there was
insufficient intelligence,

572
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,435
or capacity, to stop
those shipments.

573
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,807
So the bottom line is,
Carol, I share the concerns

574
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:09,213
of Israel, Saudis, Gulf
partners about Iran shipping

575
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,850
arms and causing conflict
and chaos in the region.

576
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,023
And that's why I've said to
them, let's double down and

577
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,358
partner much more
effectively to improve our

578
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:25,296
intelligence capacity and
our interdiction capacity so

579
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:30,034
that fewer of those arms
shipments are getting

580
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,036
through the net.

581
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:39,076
But the legal authorities,
we'll still possess.

582
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:43,681
And obviously, we've got our
own unilateral prohibitions

583
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:48,019
and sanctions in place
around non-nuclear issues,

584
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,555
like support for Hezbollah.

585
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,191
And those remain in place.

586
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,193
Now, in terms of the larger
issues of the Middle East,

587
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,270
obviously that's a
longer discussion.

588
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,434
I think my key goal when I
turn over the keys to the

589
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:09,607
President -- the next
President -- is that we are

590
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:16,848
on track to defeat ISIL;
that they are much more

591
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,917
contained and we're moving
in the right direction

592
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,319
there.

593
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,057
That we have jumpstarted a
process to resolve the civil

594
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,862
war in Syria, which is like
an open sore in the region

595
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:38,803
and is giving refuge to
terrorist organizations who

596
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,805
are taking advantage
of that chaos.

597
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:49,780
To make sure that in Iraq
not only have we pushed back

598
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:53,082
ISIL, but we've also created
an environment in which

599
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,420
Sunni, Shia and Kurd are
starting to operate and

600
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,111
function more
effectively together.

601
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:04,495
And to be in a conversation
with all our partners in the

602
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,434
region about how we have
strengthened our security

603
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:14,338
partnerships so that they
feel they can address any

604
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,975
potential threats that may
come, including threats from

605
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,278
Iran.

606
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,649
And that includes providing
additional security

607
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,651
assurances and cooperation
to Israel, building on the

608
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,287
unprecedented cooperation
that we have already put in

609
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,690
place and support that
we've already put in place.

610
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:34,538
It includes the work that
we've done with the GCC up

611
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,161
at Camp David, making sure
that we execute that.

612
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:44,802
If we've done those things,
then the problems in the

613
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:45,970
Middle East will
not be solved.

614
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:49,668
And ultimately, it's not the
job of the President of the

615
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,810
United States to solve every
problem in the Middle East.

616
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:54,083
The people of the Middle
East are going to have to

617
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,281
solve some of these
problems themselves.

618
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:02,353
But I think we can provide
that next President at least

619
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:10,094
a foundation for continued
progress in these various

620
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,095
areas.

621
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,498
The last thing I would say
-- and this is a longer-term

622
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:20,504
issue -- is we have to
address the youth in the

623
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,077
region with jobs and
opportunity and a better

624
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:32,650
vision for the future so
that they are not tempted by

625
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:38,071
the nihilistic, violent
dead-end that organizations

626
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,429
like ISIL offer.

627
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,533
Again, we can't do that
entirely by ourselves, but

628
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:53,638
we can partner with
well-intentioned

629
00:37:53,638 --> 00:38:00,111
organizations, states, NGOs,
religious leaders in the

630
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,112
region.

631
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,114
We have to do a better job
of that than we've been

632
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,116
doing so far.

633
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,386
Michael Crowley.

634
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:13,057
The Press: Thank you.

635
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,293
You alluded earlier to
Iran's role in Syria, just

636
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,195
to focus on that
for a moment.

637
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,464
Many analysts and some
former members of your

638
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,933
administration believe that
the kind of negotiated

639
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,837
political settlement that
you say is necessary in

640
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,340
Syria will require working
directly with Iran and

641
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,736
giving Iran an
important role.

642
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,243
Do you agree?

643
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,412
And is that a dialogue
you'll be actively seeking?

644
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,846
And what about the
fight against ISIS?

645
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,115
What would it take for there
to be explicit cooperation

646
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:38,849
between the U.S.

647
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:43,354
and Iran?

648
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,356
The President: I do agree
that we're not going to

649
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,391
solve the problems in Syria
unless there's buy-in from

650
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:53,264
the Russians, the Iranians,
the Turks, our Gulf

651
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,732
partners.

652
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,866
It's too chaotic.

653
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,169
There are too many factions.

654
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,806
There's too much money and
too many arms flooding into

655
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,941
the zone.

656
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:09,380
It's gotten caught up in
both sectarian conflict and

657
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:10,806
geopolitical jockeying.

658
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:15,086
And in order for us to
resolve it, there's going to

659
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:20,291
have to be agreement among
the major powers that are

660
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:25,362
interested in Syria that
this is not going to be won

661
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,298
on the battlefield.

662
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,533
So Iran is one of those
players, and I think that

663
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,336
it's important for
them to be part of that

664
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,338
conversation.

665
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,809
I want to repeat
what I said earlier.

666
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,681
We have not -- and I don't
anticipate any time in the

667
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:48,385
near future -- restored
normal diplomatic relations

668
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,287
with Iran.

669
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:56,393
And so I do not foresee a
formal set of agreements

670
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,697
with Iran in terms of
how we're conducting our

671
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,566
counter-ISIL campaign.

672
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:08,939
But clearly, Iran has
influence in Iraq.

673
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,542
Iraq has a majority
Shia population.

674
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,579
They have
relationships to Iran.

675
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,515
Some are natural.

676
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,602
We expect somebody like
Prime Minister Abadi to meet

677
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:27,057
with and negotiate and work
with Iran as its neighbor.

678
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:33,464
Some are less legitimate,
where you see Iran financing

679
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,268
Shia militias that in the
past have killed American

680
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,505
soldiers and in the future
may carry out atrocities

681
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:47,529
when they move
into Sunni areas.

682
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,648
And so we're working with
our diplomats on the ground,

683
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,350
as well as our military
teams on the ground to asses

684
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:59,742
where can we appropriately
at least de-conflict, and

685
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:06,063
where can we work with Prime
Minister Abadi around an

686
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,219
overall strategy for Iraq to
regain its sovereignty, and

687
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,206
where do we tell Abadi, you
know what, what Iran is

688
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,263
doing there is a problem,
and we can't cooperate in

689
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,853
that area, for example,
unless you get those folks

690
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,633
out of there because we're
not going to have our

691
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,585
troops, even in an advisory
or training role, looking

692
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,521
over their shoulders because
they're not sure of what

693
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,522
might happen to them.

694
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,589
And those conversations
have been ongoing.

695
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,261
I think they will continue.

696
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,998
The one thing you can count
on is that any work that the

697
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,999
U.S.

698
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,500
government does, or the U.S.

699
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:48,277
military does in Iraq with
other partners on the ground

700
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:53,344
is premised on the idea that
they are reporting to --

701
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,748
under the chain of command
of the Iraqi government and

702
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,516
Iraqi security forces.

703
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,220
If we don't have confidence
that ultimately Abadi is

704
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:06,526
directing those soldiers,
then it's tough for us to

705
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,227
have any kind of
direct relationship.

706
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:16,000
Major Garrett.

707
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,374
The Press: Thank
you, Mr. President.

708
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,743
As you well know, there are
four Americans in Iran --

709
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,045
three held on trumped-up
charges, according to your

710
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,481
administration; one,
whereabouts unknown.

711
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,318
Can you tell the country,
sir, why you are content,

712
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,520
with all the fanfare around
this deal, to leave the

713
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,054
conscience of this nation
and the strength of this

714
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,958
nation unaccounted for in
relation to these four

715
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,259
Americans?

716
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,395
And last week, the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

717
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,698
said, under no circumstances
should there be any relief

718
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,534
for Iran in terms of
ballistic missiles or

719
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,802
conventional weapons.

720
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,804
It is perceived that
that was a last-minute

721
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,901
capitulation in
these negotiations.

722
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,776
Many in the Pentagon feel
you've left the Chairman of

723
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,078
the Joint Chiefs of
Staff hung out to dry.

724
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,079
Could you comment?

725
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,082
The President: I got to give
you credit, Major, for how

726
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,984
you craft those questions.

727
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:14,325
The notion that I am content
as I celebrate with American

728
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:20,331
citizens languishing in
Iranian jails -- Major,

729
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:28,572
that's nonsense, and
you should know better.

730
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,608
I've met with the families
of some of those folks.

731
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,744
Nobody is content.

732
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,448
And our diplomats and our
teams are working diligently

733
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,450
to try to get them out.

734
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:46,690
Now, if the question is
why we did not tie the

735
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:49,873
negotiations to their
release, think about the

736
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,496
logic that that creates.

737
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,291
Suddenly, Iran realizes, you
know what, maybe we can get

738
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:02,406
additional concessions out
of the Americans by holding

739
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,374
these individuals.

740
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:07,845
It makes it much more
difficult for us to walk

741
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:12,616
away if Iran somehow thinks
that a nuclear deal is

742
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,220
dependent in some fashion
on the nuclear deal.

743
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:18,524
And, by the way, if we had
walked away from the nuclear

744
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,925
deal, we'd still be pushing
them just as hard to get

745
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,360
these folks out.

746
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,605
That's why those issues
are not connected.

747
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,866
But we are working every
single day to try to get

748
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,368
them out, and won't stop
until they're out and

749
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,436
rejoined with
their families.

750
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:38,042
With respect to the
Chairman's testimony, to

751
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:42,713
some degree I already
answered this with Carol.

752
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,715
We are not taking the
pressure off Iran with

753
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,782
respect to arms and with
respect to ballistic

754
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,386
missiles.

755
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:53,290
As I just explained, not
only do we keep in place for

756
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:56,266
five years the arms embargo
under this particular new

757
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,528
U.N.

758
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,464
resolution, not only do we
maintain the eight years on

759
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:04,068
the ballistic missiles
under this particular U.N.

760
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:08,305
resolution, but we have a
host of other multilateral

761
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:13,477
and unilateral authorities
that allow us to take action

762
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:18,949
where we see Iran engaged
in those activities whether

763
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,486
it's six years from now
or 10 years from now.

764
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,857
So we have not lost
those legal authorities.

765
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:34,765
And in fact, part of my
pitch to the GCC countries,

766
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,501
as well as to Prime Minister
Netanyahu, is we should do a

767
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:43,006
better job making sure that
Iran is not engaged in

768
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,008
sending arms to
organizations like

769
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,009
Hezbollah.

770
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,011
And as I just indicated,
that means improving our

771
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,088
intelligence capacity and
our interdiction capacity

772
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,783
with our partners.

773
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,253
April Ryan.

774
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,320
The Press: Thank
you, Mr. President.

775
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,959
I want to change
the subject a bit.

776
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,828
Earlier this year, on the
flight to Selma, you said,

777
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,064
on matters of race, as
President your job is to

778
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,833
close the remaining gaps
that are left in state and

779
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,069
federal government.

780
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:15,005
Now, how does criminal
justice reform fit into that

781
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,173
equation?

782
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,610
And what gaps remain for
you towards the end of

783
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:20,162
your presidency?

784
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,713
And also, what does it mean
to travel to Kenya, your

785
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,782
father's homeland, in the
next couple of weeks as

786
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,417
President to the
United States?

787
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:33,323
And lastly, would you revoke
the Medal of Freedom from

788
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,460
Bill Cosby?

789
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,647
The President: You stuffed
a lot in there, April.

790
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,530
(laughter)

791
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:40,854
The Press: I learned
from my colleagues.

792
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,799
The President: Say,
who did you learn from?

793
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,667
Jonathan Karl?

794
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,401
Is that what you said?

795
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,703
(laughter)

796
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:52,609
The Press: On criminal
justice reform, obviously I

797
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,696
gave a lengthy speech
yesterday, but this is

798
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,648
something that I've been
thinking about a lot; been

799
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,950
working first with Eric
Holder, now with Loretta

800
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:03,166
Lynch about -- we've been
working on along with other

801
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,625
prosecutors of the U.S.

802
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,662
Attorney's Office.

803
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,798
It's an outgrowth of the
task force that we put

804
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:19,002
together, post-Ferguson and
the Garner case in New York.

805
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:24,975
And I don't think that the
criminal justice system is

806
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:34,551
obviously the sole source
of racial tension in this

807
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:40,585
country, or the key
institution to resolving the

808
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,459
opportunity gap.

809
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,763
But I think it is a part
of the broader set of

810
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,967
challenges that we face in
creating a more perfect

811
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,468
union.

812
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:56,139
And the good news is, is
that this is one of those

813
00:47:56,139 --> 00:48:01,245
rare issues where we've
got some Republican and

814
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:06,149
Democratic interest, as well
as federal, state, and local

815
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,553
interest in solving
the problem.

816
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,989
I think people recognize
that there are violent

817
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,992
criminals out there and
they've got to be locked up.

818
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,194
We've got to have tough
prosecutors, we have to

819
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,163
support our law
enforcement officials.

820
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,934
Police are in a tough job
and they are helping to keep

821
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,270
us safe, and we are grateful
and thankful to them.

822
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:32,009
But what we also know
is this huge spike in

823
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:38,015
incarcerations is also
driven by non-violent drug

824
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,923
offenses where the
sentencing is completely out

825
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:50,527
of proportion
with the crime.

826
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,398
And that costs taxpayers
enormous amounts of money.

827
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:58,835
It is debilitating
communities who are seeing

828
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,932
huge proportions of
the young men in their

829
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,274
communities finding
themselves with a criminal

830
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:09,079
record, rendering them
oftentimes unemployable.

831
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,782
So it compounds problems
that these communities

832
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,583
already have.

833
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:18,655
And so I am very
appreciative of folks like

834
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:23,560
Dick Durbin and Cory Booker,
alongside Mike Lee and Rand

835
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:28,461
Paul and other folks in
the House who are working

836
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:35,009
together to see if we can
both reduce some of these

837
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,442
mandatory minimums around
non-violent drug offenses.

838
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,978
Because again, I tend not to
have a lot of sympathy when

839
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:42,979
it comes to violent crime.

840
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,883
But when it comes to
non-violent drug offenses,

841
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:50,320
is there work that we can
do to reduce mandatory

842
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:53,235
minimums, create more
diversion programs like drug

843
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,524
courts?

844
00:49:54,524 --> 00:50:00,530
Then, can we do a better job
on the rehabilitation side

845
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:03,824
inside of prisons so that we
are preparing these folks

846
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,737
who are eventually going to
be released to reenter the

847
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,171
workforce?

848
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,308
On the back end, are we
doing more to link them up

849
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,443
with reentry programs
that are effective?

850
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,915
And this may be an area
where we could have some

851
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,586
really significant
bipartisan legislation that

852
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,603
doesn't eliminate all the
other challenges we've got.

853
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,803
Because the most important
goal is keeping folks from

854
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,228
getting in the criminal
justice system in the first

855
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,296
place, which means early
childhood education and good

856
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:40,804
jobs, and making sure that
we're not segregating folks

857
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:45,842
in impoverished communities
that have no contact with

858
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,044
opportunity.

859
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,180
But this can make
a difference.

860
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:52,721
I met these four
ex-offenders, as I said,

861
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:58,588
yesterday, and what was
remarkable was how they had

862
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,623
turned their lives around.

863
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,359
And these were some folks
who had been some pretty

864
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,360
tough criminals.

865
00:51:03,036 --> 00:51:05,605
One of them had served 10
years; another was a repeat

866
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,931
offender that had
served a lot of time.

867
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:17,307
And in each instance,
somebody intervened at some

868
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,543
point in their lives -- once
they had already been in the

869
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,545
criminal justice system,
once they had already gotten

870
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,781
in trouble -- and said, you
know what, I think you can

871
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,218
live a different way, and
I'm willing to help you.

872
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:35,992
And that one person, an art
teacher, or a GED teacher,

873
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:40,831
or somebody who was willing
to offer a guy a job -- I

874
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,833
want to give a shout-out to
Five Guys, because one of

875
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,569
the guys there was an
ex-felon, and Five Guys gave

876
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,703
him a job.

877
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,874
And he ended up becoming a
manager at the store and was

878
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,876
able to completely
turn his life around.

879
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,145
But the point was, somebody
reached out to that person

880
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,113
and gave him a chance.

881
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:02,786
And so part of our question
should be, how about

882
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,890
somebody reaching out to
these guys when they're 10,

883
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,325
or 11, or 12, or eight, as
opposed to waiting until

884
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,128
they've already gone through
a criminal justice program.

885
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,130
That's part of why we're
doing My Brother's Keeper.

886
00:52:14,013 --> 00:52:19,519
But this is an area where I
feel modestly optimistic.

887
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,174
I think in the meantime
we've got to stay on top of

888
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,643
keeping the crime rate down,
because part of the reason I

889
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,446
think there's a conversation
taking place is violent

890
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,448
crime has
significantly dropped.

891
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,451
Last year, we saw both
incarcerations and the crime

892
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:40,190
rate drop, and this can
always turn if we start

893
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:42,922
seeing renewed problems in
terms of violent crime.

894
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,595
And there's parts of the
country where violent crime

895
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:49,232
is still a real problem,
including my hometown of

896
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,369
Chicago, and in Baltimore.

897
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:57,641
And part of what I've asked
Attorney General Lynch to do

898
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,577
is to figure out how can
we refocus attention.

899
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,579
If we're going to do a
package of criminal justice

900
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,348
reforms, part of it would be
actually having a greater

901
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,435
police presence and more
law enforcement in the

902
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,221
communities that are really
getting hit hard and haven't

903
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,223
seen some of the drops in
violent crime that we've

904
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,660
seen in places like
Manhattan, for example.

905
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,964
With respect to the visit
to Kenya, it's obviously

906
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,966
something I'm
looking forward to.

907
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,570
I'll be honest with you,
visiting Kenya as a private

908
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:32,063
citizen is probably more
meaningful to me than

909
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,847
visiting as President
because I can actually get

910
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,849
outside of a hotel room
or a conference center.

911
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:44,654
And just the logistics of
visiting a place are always

912
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,557
tough as President, but
it's obviously symbolically

913
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,959
important.

914
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,996
And my hope is, is that we
can deliver a message that

915
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:53,997
the U.S.

916
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,700
is a strong partner not
just for Kenya, but for

917
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:58,009
Sub-Saharan Africa
generally; build on the

918
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:03,006
progress that's been made
around issues of health and

919
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:07,177
education; focus on
counterterrorism issues that

920
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:10,614
are important in East Africa
because of al-Shabaab and

921
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,682
some of the tragedies that
have happened inside of

922
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:16,686
Kenya; and continue to
encourage democracy and the

923
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,783
reduction of corruption
inside that country that

924
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:25,662
sometimes has held back
this incredibly gifted and

925
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,433
blessed country.

926
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,873
And with respect to the
Medal of Freedom, there's no

927
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,845
precedent for
revoking a medal.

928
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,847
We don't have
that mechanism.

929
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,753
And as you know, I tend to
make it a policy not to

930
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:56,226
comment on the specifics
of cases where there might

931
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:01,131
still be, if not criminal,
then civil issues involved.

932
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:09,010
I'll say this: If you give a
woman -- or a man, for that

933
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:19,716
matter -- without his or her
knowledge, a drug, and then

934
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,952
have sex with that person
without consent, that's

935
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:23,953
rape.

936
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:29,926
And I think this country --
any civilized country --

937
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,968
should have no
tolerance for rape.

938
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,404
All right.

939
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:45,475
Have we exhausted
Iran questions here?

940
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,477
I think there's a
helicopter that's coming.

941
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:52,248
But I really am enjoying
this Iran debate.

942
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,451
Topics that may not
have been touched upon,

943
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,853
criticisms that you've heard
that I did not answer?

944
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:02,092
Go ahead.

945
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,361
I know Josh is getting a
little stressed here --

946
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,362
(laughter)

947
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,364
-- but I just want to make
sure that we're not leaving

948
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,432
any stones unturned here.

949
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:10,433
Go ahead.

950
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,435
The Press: Thanks,
Mr. President.

951
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,436
I'll be brief.

952
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,438
The argument has been made
that Iran now has a cash

953
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,207
windfall, billions to spend.

954
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,209
Your people seem confident
they're going to spend it at

955
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,210
home.

956
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:22,023
Why are you confident
they're not going to spend

957
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,249
it on arming Hezbollah,
arming Bashar al-Assad, et

958
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:26,583
cetera?

959
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,686
The President: I think
that's a great question and

960
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,921
I'm glad you brought it up.

961
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:38,128
I think it is a mistake to
characterize our belief that

962
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:43,032
they will just spend it on
daycare centers, and roads,

963
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:46,059
and paying down debt.

964
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,379
We think that they have to
do some of that, because

965
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,441
Rouhani was elected
specifically on the premise

966
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:56,379
of improving the economic
situation inside of Iran.

967
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,582
That economy has tanked
since we imposed sanctions.

968
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:04,320
So the notion that they're
just immediately going to

969
00:57:04,032 --> 00:57:10,339
turn over $100 billion to
the IRGC or the Quds Force I

970
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,654
think runs contrary to all
the intelligence that we've

971
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,066
seen and the commitments
that the Iranian government

972
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,169
has made.

973
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:23,196
Do we think that with the
sanctions coming down, that

974
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:26,743
Iran will have some
additional resources for its

975
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,840
military and for some of the
activities in the region

976
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:38,221
that are a threat to us and
a threat to our allies?

977
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:44,294
I think that is a likelihood
that they've got some

978
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,296
additional resources.

979
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,366
Do I think it's a
game-changer for them?

980
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,769
No.

981
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,826
They are currently
supporting Hezbollah, and

982
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:01,911
there is a ceiling -- a pace
at which they could support

983
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,047
Hezbollah even more,
particularly in the chaos

984
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,116
that's taking
place in Syria.

985
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:10,753
So can they potentially
try to get more assistance

986
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:11,754
there?

987
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,856
Yes.

988
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,692
Should we put more resources
into blocking them from

989
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,694
getting that assistance
to Hezbollah?

990
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,695
Yes.

991
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:24,701
Is the incremental
additional money that

992
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:30,795
they've got to try to
destabilize the region or

993
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:36,713
send to their proxies, is
that more important than

994
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,382
preventing Iran from
getting a nuclear weapon?

995
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,584
No.

996
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:46,556
So I think -- again, this
is a matter of us making a

997
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,893
determination of
what is our priority.

998
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:53,062
The other problem with the
argument that folks have

999
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,149
been making about, oh, this
is a windfall and suddenly

1000
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,934
Iran is flushed with cash,
and they're going to take

1001
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,936
over the world.

1002
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,938
And I say that not
tongue-in-cheek, because if

1003
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,940
you look at some of the
statements by some of our

1004
00:59:03,094 --> 00:59:05,229
critics, you would think
that Iran is, in fact, going

1005
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,177
to take over the world as a
consequence of this deal --

1006
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:12,248
which I think would be
news to the Iranians.

1007
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:21,561
That argument is also
premised on the notion that

1008
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,691
if there is no deal, if
Congress votes down this

1009
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:29,999
deal, that we're able to
keep sanctions in place with

1010
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,435
the same vigor and
effectiveness as we have

1011
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,170
right now.

1012
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:37,854
And that, I can promise
you, is not true.

1013
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,276
That is absolutely not true.

1014
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:44,180
I want to repeat: We're
not writing Iran a check.

1015
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:47,055
This is Iran's money that we
were able to block from them

1016
00:59:47,055 --> 00:59:48,523
having access to.

1017
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:53,122
That required the
cooperation of countries all

1018
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:57,860
around the world, many of
whom really want to purchase

1019
00:59:57,086 --> 00:59:59,689
oil from Iran.

1020
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:03,900
The imposition of sanctions
-- their cooperation with us

1021
01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:07,980
-- has cost them billions of
dollars, made it harder for

1022
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,040
them.

1023
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:13,540
They've been willing to
do that because they've

1024
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,673
believed we were sincere
about trying to resolve the

1025
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,015
nuclear issue peacefully,
and they considered that a

1026
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,017
priority -- a high enough
priority that they were

1027
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,820
willing to cooperate
with us on sanctions.

1028
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:27,186
If they saw us walking away,
or more specifically, if

1029
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:28,958
they saw the U.S.

1030
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:34,964
Congress effectively vetoing
the judgment of 99 percent

1031
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,939
of the world community that
this is a deal that resolves

1032
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,843
the Iranian weapons program
-- nuclear weapons program

1033
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:52,849
in an equitable way, the
sanctions system unravels.

1034
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,288
And so we could still
maintain some of our

1035
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,525
unilateral sanctions, but it
would be far less effective

1036
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,797
-- as it was before we were
able to put together these

1037
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:08,865
multilateral sanctions.

1038
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:12,769
So maybe they don't get $100
billion; maybe they get $60

1039
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:17,206
billion or $70
billion instead.

1040
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:21,778
The price for that that
we've paid is that now Iran

1041
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,916
is pursuing a
nuclear weapon.

1042
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,519
We have no inspectors
on the ground.

1043
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,521
We don't know
what's going on.

1044
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,092
They're still getting
some cash windfall.

1045
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,595
We've lost credibility in
the eyes of the world.

1046
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:44,100
We will have effectively
united Iran and divided

1047
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,136
ourselves from our allies.

1048
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:49,872
A terrible
position to be in.

1049
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,508
I'm just going to look -- I
made some notes about any of

1050
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,210
the arguments -- the other
arguments that I've

1051
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:55,723
heard here.

1052
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:56,879
The Press: What
about -- (off-mic)

1053
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,947
-- the end of the deal?

1054
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,850
The President: Okay,
yes, that's a good one.

1055
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:00,986
The notion --

1056
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:02,018
The Press: A
the end of the deal they

1057
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,153
could go back --

1058
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,521
The President:
Right.

1059
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,589
Well, so let's address this
issue of -- because that's

1060
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,891
the other big argument
that's been made.

1061
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:14,130
All right, let's assume that
the deal holds for 10 years,

1062
01:02:14,013 --> 01:02:16,282
Iran doesn't cheat.

1063
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:22,371
Now, at the end of 10 years,
some of the restrictions

1064
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,428
have been lifted --
although, remember, others

1065
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,576
stay in place for 15 years.

1066
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,578
So for example, they've
still got to keep their

1067
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:33,649
stockpiles at a minimal
level for 15 years.

1068
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:38,921
The inspections don't go
away; those are still in

1069
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,925
place 15, 20 years from now.

1070
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,012
Their commitment under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty

1071
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,831
does not go away;
that's still in place.

1072
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:55,004
The additional protocol that
they have to sign up for

1073
01:02:55,004 --> 01:03:00,143
under this deal, which
requires a more extensive

1074
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:03,045
inspection and verification
mechanism -- that stays in

1075
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,047
place.

1076
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:13,789
So there's no scenario
in which a U.S.

1077
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:19,795
President is not in a
stronger position 12, 13, 15

1078
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:25,368
years from now if, in fact,
Iran decided at that point

1079
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,703
they still wanted to
get a nuclear weapon.

1080
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,006
Keep in mind, we will have
maintained a one-year

1081
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:34,010
breakout time, we will have
rolled back their program,

1082
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:37,504
frozen their facilities,
kept them under severe

1083
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:40,049
restrictions, had observers.

1084
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,051
They will have made
international commitments

1085
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,288
supported by countries
around the world.

1086
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:51,227
And -- hold on a second --
and if at that point they

1087
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:55,131
finally decided, you know
what, we're going to cheat,

1088
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:59,468
or not even cheat -- at that
point, they decide openly

1089
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:04,373
we're now pursuing a nuclear
weapon -- they're still in

1090
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,877
violation of this deal and
the commitments they've made

1091
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,313
internationally.

1092
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:13,816
And so we are still in a
position to mobilize the

1093
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:17,720
world community to say, no,
you can't have a nuclear

1094
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:18,073
weapon.

1095
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,723
And they're not in a
stronger position to get a

1096
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,725
nuclear weapon at that
point; they're in a weaker

1097
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:25,094
position than
they are today.

1098
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,231
And, by the way, we haven't
given away any of our

1099
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,298
military capabilities.

1100
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,978
We're not in a weaker
position to respond.

1101
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:40,509
So even if everything the
critics were saying was true

1102
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:47,316
-- that at the end of 10
years, or 12 years, or 15

1103
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:52,888
years, Iran now is in a
position to decide it wants

1104
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:58,894
a nuclear weapon, that
they're at a breakout point

1105
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,035
-- they won't be at a
breakout point that is more

1106
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,037
dangerous than the breakout
point they're in right now.

1107
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:14,655
They won't be at a breakout
point that is shorter than

1108
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,446
the one that exists today.

1109
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:30,063
And so why wouldn't we at
least make sure that for the

1110
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:34,897
next 10, 15, years they are
not getting a nuclear weapon

1111
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:40,136
and we can verify it; and
afterwards, if they decide

1112
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:43,213
if they've changed their
mind, we are then much more

1113
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,175
knowledgeable about what
their capabilities are, much

1114
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,278
more knowledgeable about
what their program is, and

1115
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,614
still in a position to take
whatever actions we would

1116
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,615
take today?

1117
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,617
The Press: So none of this
is holding out hope that

1118
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,618
they'll change
their behavior?

1119
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,619
The President: No.

1120
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,621
The Press: Nothing different
-- The President: No.

1121
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,890
Look, I'm always hopeful
that behavior may change for

1122
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:03,726
the sake of the Iranian
people as well as people in

1123
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:05,528
the region.

1124
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,625
There are young people there
who are not getting the

1125
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:13,502
opportunities they deserve
because of conflict, because

1126
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,579
of sectarianism, because of
poor governance, because of

1127
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,407
repression, because
of terrorism.

1128
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,478
And I remain eternally
hopeful that we can do

1129
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,880
something about that, and
it should be part of U.S.

1130
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:26,090
foreign policy to do
something about that.

1131
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,719
But I'm not banking on that
to say that this deal is the

1132
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,220
right thing to do.

1133
01:06:31,022 --> 01:06:35,059
Again, it is incumbent on
the critics of this deal to

1134
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,461
explain how an American
President is in a worse

1135
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:44,467
position 12, 13, 14, 15
years from now if, in fact,

1136
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:50,439
at that point Iran says
we're going to pull out of

1137
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:55,378
the NPT, kick out inspectors
and go for a nuclear bomb.

1138
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:02,551
If that happens, that
President will be in a

1139
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:06,455
better position than what
happened if Iran, as a

1140
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,592
consequence of Congress
rejecting this deal, decides

1141
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,228
that's it, we're done
negotiating, we're going

1142
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,230
after a bomb right now.

1143
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,812
The choices would be tougher
today than they would be for

1144
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,237
that President 15
years from now.

1145
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:26,976
And I have not yet heard
logic that refutes that.

1146
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:27,977
All right.

1147
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:28,978
I really have to go now.

1148
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,980
I think we've hit
the big themes.

1149
01:07:30,098 --> 01:07:32,600
But I promise you, I
will address this again.

1150
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,950
All right?

1151
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:36,097
I suspect this is not the
last that we've heard of

1152
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,454
this debate.
