1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I was born in Den Bosch,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
And so I've always been very fond of this painter

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
who lived and worked in the 15th century.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And what is interesting about him in relation to morality

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
is that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and he was sort of wondering, I think,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
what would happen with society

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
if there was no religion or if there was less religion.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
And so he painted this famous painting, "The Garden of Earthly Delights,"

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
which some have interpreted

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
as being humanity before the Fall,

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
or being humanity without any Fall at all.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
And so it makes you wonder,

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
what would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
and what kind of morality would we have?

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Much later, as a student,

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
I went to a very different garden,

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
a zoological garden in Arnhem

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
where we keep chimpanzees.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
(Laughter)

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
And I discovered there

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And at that time the focus in a lot of animal research

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
was on aggression and competition.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom,

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and humanity included,

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
was that deep down we are competitors,

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
we are aggressive,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,820
we're all out for our own profit basically.

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
This is the launch of my book.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
I'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it,

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
but they surely seemed interested in the book.

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Now in the process

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
of doing all this work on power and dominance

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
and aggression and so on,

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
They ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
And about a second after I took the picture, they came together in the fork of the tree

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
and they kissed and embraced each other.

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Now this is very interesting

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
because at the time everything was about competition and aggression,

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
and so it wouldn't make any sense.

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose.

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
But why would you reconcile after a fight?

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
That doesn't make any sense.

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
This is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
And so they also reconcile with sex.

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
But the principle is exactly the same.

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
The principle is that you have

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
a valuable relationship

54
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
that is damaged by conflict,

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
so you need to do something about it.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
So my whole picture of the animal kingdom,

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
and including humans also,

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
started to change at that time.

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
So we have this image

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
in political science, economics, the humanities,

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
philosophy for that matter,

62
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
that man is a wolf to man.

63
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And so deep down our nature's actually nasty.

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
The wolf is, after all,

66
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
a very cooperative animal.

67
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
And that's why many of you have a dog at home,

68
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
which has all these characteristics also.

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And it's really unfair to humanity,

70
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
than given credit for.

72
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
So I started getting interested in those issues

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
and studying that in other animals.

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
So these are the pillars of morality.

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,820
If you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
these are the two factors that always come out.

77
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
One is reciprocity,

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.

79
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
And the other one is empathy and compassion.

80
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
And human morality is more than this,

81
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
but if you would remove these two pillars,

82
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
there would be not much remaining I think.

83
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
And so they're absolutely essential.

84
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
So let me give you a few examples here.

85
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
This is a very old video 
from the Yerkes Primate Center

86
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
where they train chimpanzees to cooperate.

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
["1937"] So this is already
about a hundred years ago

88
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
that we were doing experiments on cooperation.

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box,

90
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.

91
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
And of course, there's food on the box.

92
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And so they're bringing in the box.

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
And you can see that they're synchronized.

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
You can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.

96
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
It's already a big advance over many other animals

97
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
who wouldn't be able to do that.

98
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And now you're going to get a more interesting picture,

99
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
because now one of the two chimps has been fed.

100
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So one of the two is not really interested

101
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
in the task anymore.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
(Laughter)

103
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
(Laughter)

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,550
(Laughter)

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,070
[" -- and sometimes appears to convey
its wishes and meanings by gestures."]

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,990
Now look at what happens 
at the very end of this.

107
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
(Laughter)

108
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
He takes basically everything.

109
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,660
(Laughter)

110
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,820
So there are two interesting
parts about this.

111
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
One is that the chimp on the right

112
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
has a full understanding he needs the partner --

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
so a full understanding of the need for cooperation.

114
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
The second one is that the partner is willing to work

115
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
even though he's not interested in the food.

116
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Why would that be? Well that probably has to do with reciprocity.

117
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
There's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals

118
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
that they return favors.

119
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
So he will get a return favor

120
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
at some point in the future.

121
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
And so that's how this all operates.

122
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
We do the same task with elephants.

123
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Now with elephants, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.

124
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Another problem with elephants

125
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
is that you cannot make an apparatus

126
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
that is too heavy for a single elephant.

127
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Now you can probably make it,

128
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
but it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think.

129
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
And so what we did in that case --

130
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik --

131
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.

132
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
And if you pull on this side of the rope,

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
the rope disappears on the other side.

134
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull.

135
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Otherwise nothing is going to happen

136
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
and the rope disappears.

137
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
And the first tape you're going to see

138
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
is two elephants who are released together

139
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
arrive at the apparatus.

140
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
The apparatus is on the left with food on it.

141
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
And so they come together, they arrive together,

142
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
they pick it up together and they pull together.

143
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
So it's actually fairly simple for them.

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
There they are.

145
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
And so that's how they bring it in.

146
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
But now we're going to make it more difficult.

147
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Because the whole purpose of this experiment

148
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
is to see how well they understand cooperation.

149
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Do they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?

150
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And so what we do in the next step

151
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
is we release one elephant before the other,

152
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and that elephant needs to be smart enough

153
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope --

154
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
because if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.

155
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Now this elephant does something illegal

156
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
that we did not teach it.

157
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
But it shows the understanding that he has,

158
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
because he puts his big foot on the rope,

159
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
stands on the rope and waits there for the other,

160
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
and then the other is going to do all the work for him.

161
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
So it's what we call freeloading.

162
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
(Laughter)

163
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.

164
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
They develop several of these alternative techniques

165
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
that we did not approve of necessarily.

166
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,820
So the other elephant is now coming

167
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
and is going to pull it in.

168
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Now look at the other. The other doesn't forget to eat, of course.

169
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,820
(Laughter)

170
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
This was the cooperation, reciprocity part.

171
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Now something on empathy.

172
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research.

173
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
And empathy has sort of two qualities.

174
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
One is the understanding part of it. This is just a regular definition:

175
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

176
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
And the emotional part.

177
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
And so empathy has basically two channels.

178
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
One is the body channel.

179
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
If you talk with a sad person,

180
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
you're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture,

181
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
and before you know it you feel sad.

182
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
And that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy,

183
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
which many animals have.

184
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Your average dog has that also.

185
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
That's actually why people keep mammals in the home

186
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and not turtles or snakes or something like that

187
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
who don't have that kind of empathy.

188
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
And then there's a cognitive channel,

189
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.

190
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
And that's more limited.

191
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
There's few animals -- I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing --

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
but there are very few animals who can do that.

193
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
So synchronization,

194
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
which is part of that whole empathy mechanism

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
is a very old one in the animal kingdom.

196
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
And in humans, of course, we can study that

197
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
with yawn contagion.

198
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Humans yawn when others yawn.

199
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
And it's related to empathy.

200
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
It activates the same areas in the brain.

201
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Also, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion

202
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
are highly empathic.

203
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
People who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children,

204
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
they don't have yawn contagion.

205
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
So it is connected.

206
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.

207
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So that's what you see on the upper-left,

208
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
an animated head that yawns.

209
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And there's a chimpanzee watching,

210
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen

211
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
on which we play these animations.

212
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
(Laughter)

213
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
So yawn contagion

214
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
that you're probably all familiar with --

215
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and maybe you're going to start yawning soon now --

216
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
is something that we share with other animals.

217
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization

218
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
that underlies empathy

219
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
and that is universal in the mammals basically.

220
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Now we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation.

221
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming,

222
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him

223
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
and calms him down.

224
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
That's consolation. It's very similar to human consolation.

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
And consolation behavior,

226
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
it's empathy driven.

227
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Actually the way to study empathy in human children

228
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
is to instruct a family member to act distressed,

229
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
and then they see what young children do.

230
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
And so it is related to empathy,

231
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
and that's the kind of expressions we look at.

232
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.

233
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
It's on altruism and chimpanzees

234
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
where the question is, do chimpanzees care

235
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
about the welfare of somebody else?

236
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
And for decades it had been assumed

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
that only humans can do that,

238
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.

239
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Now we did a very simple experiment.

240
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville,

241
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
in the field station of Yerkes.

242
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
And so that's how they live.

243
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
And we call them into a room and do experiments with them.

244
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
In this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side.

245
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
and one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.

246
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses,

247
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
the other one feeds both of them.

248
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner.

249
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
And here you have the two color tokens.

250
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
So they have a whole bucket full of them.

251
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And they have to pick one of the two colors.

252
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
You will see how that goes.

253
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,

254
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
which is the red token in this case,

255
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
he needs to give it to us.

256
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
So we pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards,

257
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
but in this case only the one on the right gets food.

258
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
The one on the left walks away because she knows already.

259
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
that this is not a good test for her.

260
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Then the next one is the pro-social token.

261
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
So the one who makes the choices -- that's the interesting part here --

262
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
for the one who makes the choices,

263
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
it doesn't really matter.

264
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
So she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.

265
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.

266
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.

267
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
And she should actually be choosing blindly.

268
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
But what we find

269
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
is that they prefer the pro-social token.

270
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
So this is the 50 percent line that's the random expectation.

271
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
And especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more.

272
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
And if the partner puts pressure on them --

273
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them --

274
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
then the choices go down.

275
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
It's as if they're saying,

276
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
"If you're not behaving, I'm not going to be pro-social today."

277
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
And this is what happens without a partner,

278
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
when there's no partner sitting there.

279
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
And so we found that the chimpanzees do care

280
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
about the well-being of somebody else --

281
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
especially, these are other members of their own group.

282
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
So the final experiment that I want to mention to you

283
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
is our fairness study.

284
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And so this became a very famous study.

285
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
And there's now many more,

286
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
because after we did this about 10 years ago,

287
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
it became very well known.

288
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys.

289
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.

290
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
It has now been done with dogs and with birds

291
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
and with chimpanzees.

292
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys.

293
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
So what we did

294
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side.

295
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Again, these animals, they live in a group, they know each other.

296
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.

297
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
And there's a very simple task

298
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
that they need to do.

299
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
And if you give both of them cucumber for the task,

300
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
the two monkeys side-by-side,

301
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
they're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.

302
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,820
So cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion,

303
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.

304
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Now if you give the partner grapes --

305
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys

306
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket --

307
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and so if you give them grapes -- it's a far better food --

308
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
then you create inequity between them.

309
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
So that's the experiment we did.

310
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task,

311
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction,

312
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
and that turned out to be right.

313
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.

314
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes.

315
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
The one who gets cucumber,

316
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.

317
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
The first piece she eats.

318
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Then she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.

319
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
So she gives a rock to us. That's the task.

320
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.

321
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
The other one needs to give a rock to us.

322
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
And that's what she does.

323
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
And she gets a grape and she eats it.

324
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
The other one sees that.

325
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
She gives a rock to us now,

326
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
gets, again, cucumber.

327
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:38,820
(Laughter)

328
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
She tests a rock now against the wall.

329
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
She needs to give it to us.

330
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
And she gets cucumber again.

331
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,820
(Laughter)

332
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,820
So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.

333
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
(Laughter)

334
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
(Applause)

335
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Let me tell you --

336
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
I still have two minutes left, let me tell you a funny story about this.

337
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
This study became very famous

338
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
and we got a lot of comments,

339
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
especially anthropologists, economists,

340
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
philosophers.

341
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
They didn't like this at all.

342
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Because they had decided in their minds, I believe,

343
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
that fairness is a very complex issue

344
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
and that animals cannot have it.

345
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
And so one philosopher even wrote us

346
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness

347
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
because fairness was invented during the French Revolution.

348
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
(Laughter)

349
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Now another one wrote a whole chapter

350
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,820
saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness

351
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.

352
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,

353
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
who's been doing this with chimpanzees,

354
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees

355
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
where, indeed, the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape

356
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
until the other guy also got a grape.

357
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.

358
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,820
And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile.

359
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
So let me summarize.

360
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
I believe there's an evolved morality.

361
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about,

362
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
but it would be impossible without these ingredients

363
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
that we find in other primates,

364
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
which are empathy and consolation,

365
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.

366
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
And so we work on these particular issues

367
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak,

368
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
without necessarily God and religion involved,

369
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
and to see how we can get to an evolved morality.

370
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
And I thank you for your attention.

371
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:41,820
(Applause)
