1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
We all make decisions every day; we want to know

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
exactly the right thing at all possible times,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
that would be a tremendous gift.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
and I also want to explain to you why it is

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,820
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,820
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
The expected value of any of our actions --

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,820
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
is the product of two simple things:

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
and the value of that gain to us.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,820
we will always know precisely how we should behave.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,820
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,820
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
that multiplies to five, and that's more

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,820
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,820
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,820
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.

37
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,820
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
what the right thing is to do, and those are

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,820
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Now, let me talk about the first one first.

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,820
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.

46
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,820
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,820
or of flipping a heads.

48
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,820
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I should say, lose more -- gambling

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,820
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
The way people figure odds

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

57
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
observed in any particular day in Oxford.

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is

60
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
you quickly reviewed in memory the times

61
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,820
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,

65
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
then dogs on leashes are more probable.

66
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,820
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.

68
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Are there more four-letter English words

69
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,820
with R in the third place or R in the first place?

70
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,820
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.

73
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
with R in the third than the first place.

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,820
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.

77
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.

78
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.

79
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
It's like the dictionary;

80
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.

81
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
So, this is an example of how this idea that

82
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
the quickness with which things come to mind

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
can give you a sense of their probability --

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds

86
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
these are estimates of number of deaths per year

88
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
per 200 million U.S. citizens.

89
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,820
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

91
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Compare these to the actual numbers.

92
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,

93
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.

94
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Two things are vastly underestimated:

95
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?

96
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

97
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"

98
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
It's not interesting because it's so common.

99
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,820
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances

100
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen

101
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck

102
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.

103
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.

104
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,

105
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
we vastly underestimate them.

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game

107
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,820
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say

108
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.

110
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination

111
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
of all three of the others that you see on the slide.

112
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case

113
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
of people's ability to compute probabilities.

114
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --

115
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery

116
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,820
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff

117
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
by investing your money in a lottery ticket

118
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,

120
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,820
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.

121
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?

122
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,

123
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,

124
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --

125
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.

126
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.

127
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews

128
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
with everybody who lost?

129
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Indeed, if we required that television stations run

130
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
a 30-second interview with each loser

131
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,820
every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers

132
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years

133
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
of your undivided attention just to watch them say,

134
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."

135
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --

136
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,820
no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,

137
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"

138
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.

139
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.

140
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.

141
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.

142
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,

143
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?

144
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.

145
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;

146
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.

147
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."

148
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery:

149
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
imagine that the nine tickets are all owned

150
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
by one fat guy named Leroy.

151
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.

152
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.

153
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,

154
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,820
but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.

155
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?

156
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"

157
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy

159
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
changes your decision to play,

160
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.

161
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake

162
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
compared to trying to estimate value:

163
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,

164
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
how much pleasure it will give us.

165
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I want to talk now about errors in value.

166
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,820
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --

168
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
you wouldn't pay that for it.

169
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:

171
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
What else can I do with 25 dollars?

172
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,820
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia

173
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
and realized that they're not going to serve you any food,

174
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened

175
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches

176
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
is wafting over the seat, you think,

177
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.

178
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.

180
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,

181
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.

182
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,

183
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
before I'd even told you anything about the context?

184
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,

186
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment

187
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,820
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
And this is a systematic error people make.

189
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,820
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.

190
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing

191
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.

192
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
For example, this is, of course,

193
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,

194
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
is to say something used to be higher,

195
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.

196
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
When people are asked about these two different jobs:

197
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,

198
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,

199
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,

200
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,820
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact

201
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
they're all told they make much less money. Why?

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse

203
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,820
than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher

204
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,820
in the declining period. Here's another nice example.

205
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.

206
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?

207
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:

208
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,820
$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,

209
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
so you decide to mull it over for a week.

210
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --

211
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,820
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.

212
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500

213
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
for something that was 700 last week.

214
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
This tendency to compare to the past

215
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,820
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,

216
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good

217
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,820
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

218
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
Here's another example of how comparing to the past

219
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,820
can befuddle our decisions.

220
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Imagine that you're going to the theater.

221
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
You're on your way to the theater.

222
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.

223
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
You also have a 20-dollar bill.

224
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
When you arrive at the theater,

225
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.

226
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?

227
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Most people answer, no.

228
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.

229
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
You're on your way to the theater,

230
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

231
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.

232
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?

233
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.

234
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?

235
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Now, just in case you're not getting it,

236
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?

237
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
(Laughter)

238
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Along the way, you lost something.

239
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.

240
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.

241
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
What the hell difference should it make?

242
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,

243
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.

244
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --

245
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,820
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.

246
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems

247
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify

248
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
in people's attempts to assign value.

249
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,820
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,

250
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.

251
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.

252
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
One of the things we know about comparison:

253
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.

254
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,820
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were

255
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,

256
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
didn't seem like such a great guy.

257
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.

258
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
(Laughter)

259
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.

260
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,

261
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
and they use this wisdom to help you --

262
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
spare you the undue burden of money.

263
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop

264
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,

265
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,820
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?

266
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Most people don't want the most expensive,

267
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
they don't want the least expensive.

268
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.

269
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item

270
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,

271
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,820
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.

272
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
So I'm telling you something you already knew:

273
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,820
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.

274
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Here's why that's a problem:

275
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,820
the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,

276
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,820
it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.

277
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,820
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,

278
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,820
where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,

279
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.

280
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,820
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil

281
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
our attempts to make rational decisions.

282
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Let me just give you an example.

283
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,820
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.

284
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked

285
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
the simplest of all questions:

286
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,820
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?

287
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.

288
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room

289
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.

290
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,820
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change

291
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.

292
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Namely, those who are looking at Spam

293
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty;

294
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
those who are looking at Godiva chocolate

295
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
think they won't be nearly so tasty.

296
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?

297
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that

298
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,820
when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,

299
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
what's sitting in the corner of the room

300
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,820
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.

301
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison

302
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
that then does not carry through and change their experience.

303
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come

304
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:

305
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
You want to buy a car stereo.

306
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,820
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,

307
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.

308
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?

309
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Most people say they would.

310
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price

311
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,820
when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.

312
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,

313
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.

314
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,820
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.

315
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.

316
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town

317
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?

318
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,820
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.

319
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,820
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --

320
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
doesn't know where it came from.

321
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
It doesn't know what you saved it on.

322
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,

323
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,

324
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.

325
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks

326
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.

327
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager

328
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,820
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,

329
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.

330
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,

331
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks

332
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
to the purchase that you're making,

333
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.

334
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
You've all had this experience.

335
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,820
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.

336
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
And at some point you may have met a couple

337
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
from your own hometown, and you thought,

338
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,820
"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.

339
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me

340
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,

341
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,

342
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,

343
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
and what do you find?

344
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Compared to your regular friends,

345
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,820
they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,

346
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself

347
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,820
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.

348
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.

349
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --

350
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,820
these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,

351
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:

352
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
the big ones sound a little better.

353
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
And so you buy them, and you bring them home,

354
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
and you entirely violate the décor of your house.

355
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store

356
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
is a comparison you'll never make again.

357
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,

358
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"

359
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
which you can't even remember hearing.

360
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult

361
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
when these choices are arrayed over time.

362
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
People have a lot of trouble making decisions

363
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,820
about things that will happen at different points in time.

364
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered

365
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
is that by and large people use two simple rules.

366
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,820
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem

367
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
and then a third, hard, problem.

368
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Here's the first easy problem:

369
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?

370
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,820
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?

371
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,

372
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
we believe more is better than less.

373
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Here's the second problem:

374
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?

375
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Again, an easy decision,

376
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,820
because we all know that now is better than later.

377
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.

378
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,820
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.

379
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain

380
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
by waiting, but you have to be patient.

381
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?

382
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.

383
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred

384
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,820
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification

385
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,820
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.

386
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is

387
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,820
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing

388
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,820
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.

389
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --

390
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,820
or 60 dollars in 13 months.

391
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
What do we find now?

392
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,

393
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
they might as well wait 13.

394
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,820
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?

395
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.

396
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested

397
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,

398
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher

399
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,820
than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now

400
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --

401
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,820
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision

402
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
off into the future a year.

403
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?

404
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
These guys can tell us.

405
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,820
What you see here are two lads,

406
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,820
one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.

407
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,

408
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
and I want you to notice two things.

409
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,820
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.

410
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,820
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.

411
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,

412
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,820
then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.

413
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Here are the results of what I just showed you.

414
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
This is the subjective height --

415
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,820
the height you saw of these guys at various points.

416
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
And I want you to see that two things are true.

417
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;

418
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.

419
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,820
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.

420
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,820
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,

421
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
but at a far distance

422
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
their normal, their true, relations are preserved.

423
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,820
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.

424
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,820
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:

425
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
60 now or 50 in a month?

426
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
And these are subjective values,

427
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.

428
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
People always think more is better than less:

429
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
60 is always better than 50,

430
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
and they always think now is better than later:

431
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,820
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.

432
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,820
Watch what happens when we drop some out.

433
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.

434
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,820
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now

435
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.

436
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that

437
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,820
when people get to the future, they will change their minds.

438
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,820
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,

439
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,820
what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?

440
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,820
I'll take the 50 dollars now.

441
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this:

442
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,820
If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?

443
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence

444
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,820
of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.

445
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard

446
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:

447
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,820
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world

448
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
than the one in which we are living.

449
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
They were evolved for a world

450
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
in which people lived in very small groups,

451
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,820
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,

452
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,820
had rather short lives in which there were few choices

453
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,820
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.

454
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us

455
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,820
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.

456
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,820
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains

457
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,820
why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.

458
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
We are the only species on this planet

459
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,820
that has ever held its own fate in its hands.

460
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
We have no significant predators,

461
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
we're the masters of our physical environment;

462
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,820
the things that normally cause species to become extinct

463
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,820
are no longer any threat to us.

464
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,820
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us

465
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
are our own decisions.

466
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,820
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because

467
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,820
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us

468
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,820
by a young Dutch fellow in 1738,

469
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,820
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains

470
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,820
and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.

471
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
Thank you.

472
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:56,820
(Applause)

473
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.

474
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,820
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.

475
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism

476
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,820
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,

477
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,820
and is there some way that we could counteract that?

478
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently

479
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,820
with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes

480
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,820
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.

481
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,820
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name

482
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,820
based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,

483
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask

484
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,820
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,

485
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to

486
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,820
stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.

487
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,820
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --

488
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,820
and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.

489
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
We already know, for example, in the United States,

490
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,820
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --

491
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
because they were scared -- and driving on highways,

492
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
than were killed in 9/11. OK?

493
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
If I told you that there was a plague

494
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,

495
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,820
you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.

496
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,820
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering

497
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
whether they should get the kind of play,

498
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
the kind of coverage, that they do.

499
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood

500
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
that they'll be hurt in these various ways,

501
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.

502
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying

503
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,820
that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?

504
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
Talk more about it.

505
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,820
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.

506
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
If Australia disappears tomorrow,

507
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
terror is probably the right response.

508
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,820
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,

509
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,820
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,

510
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
more people than that were killed

511
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,820
by not using their seatbelts in the same country.

512
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Is terror the right response?

513
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,820
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --

514
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
that it's so spectacular?

515
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?

516
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
What is it?

517
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,820
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.

518
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --

519
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
it's not a tree falling on us by accident.

520
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.

521
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,820
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --

522
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,820
as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.

523
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,820
So there are a number of things that together

524
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,820
make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down

525
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,820
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it

526
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,820
they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,

527
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
who want these things to be

528
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,820
as spectacular as they possibly can.

529
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,820
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?

530
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,

531
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
go to Israel. And a mall blows up,

532
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,820
and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --

533
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,820
at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall

534
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel

535
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,820
and the wedding that was planned was still going on.

536
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
And as the Israeli mother said,

537
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,820
she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."

538
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
I mean, this is a society that has learned --

539
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
and there are others too -- that has learned to live

540
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,820
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,

541
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,820
shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.

542
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,820
CA: But is there a rational fear that actually,

543
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,820
the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that

544
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
the Big One is to come?

545
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,820
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack

546
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,820
there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --

547
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
we would probably not be nearly so frightened.

548
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere

549
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,820
as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."

550
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
That's not my point at all.

551
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,

552
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,820
our distress about things that happen, about threats,

553
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,820
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats

554
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
and threats to come.

555
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,820
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.

556
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --

557
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
how many people do you know got up and said,

558
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.

559
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,820
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.

560
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,820
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.

561
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
There are no guns going off.

562
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,820
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,

563
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,820
which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?

564
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,820
(Laughter)

565
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,820
(Applause)

566
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,820
That's a tough one.

567
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
CA: There's no question.

568
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,

569
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,820
unless someone can show that there's, you know,

570
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,820
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.

571
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,820
The latest I've read, seen, thought

572
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,820
is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.

573
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,820
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,

574
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
but with poverty it's a bit --

575
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,820
DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.

576
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
CA: We've evolved to get all excited

577
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,820
about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,

578
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,820
in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease

579
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
and systems that cause poverty and so forth,

580
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,820
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy

581
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
into worrying about those things?

582
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,820
People died; so be it.

583
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,820
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.

584
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
And so we evolved these responses.

585
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Is that what happened?

586
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,820
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical

587
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,820
about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything

588
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.

589
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,820
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific

590
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,820
in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for

591
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,820
an evolutionary explanation, you might say

592
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,820
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared

593
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
of stuff that's new and different.

594
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,820
And there's a good reason to be,

595
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,820
because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?

596
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely

597
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,820
to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.

598
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,820
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,

599
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
our general tendency is to orient towards

600
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,820
that which is new and novel is activated.

601
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,820
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism

602
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,820
as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.

603
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about

604
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,820
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect

605
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,820
you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,

606
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
which is the error of value.

607
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
I know, because I've interviewed

608
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,820
about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.

609
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,820
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.

610
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
That's what you think it is. All right?

611
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,820
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,

612
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,820
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,

613
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,820
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?

614
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,820
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.

615
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,820
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning

616
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,820
releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling

617
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,820
until the drawing indicates you've lost.

618
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,

619
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money

620
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.

621
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Now, economists tend to --

622
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,820
(Applause)

623
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
-- economists tend to view the world

624
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
through their own lenses, which is:

625
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
this is just a bunch of stupid people.

626
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,820
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.

627
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,820
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,

628
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,820
we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.

629
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,820
(Applause)

630
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,820
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen

631
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,820
whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled

632
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,820
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,

633
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,820
people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,

634
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,820
even though they don't feel great during the drawing.

635
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,820
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.

636
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,820
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,

637
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,820
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.

638
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,820
But certainly I see your point: that there can be

639
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,820
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.

640
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,820
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.

641
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,820
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.

642
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
CA: Last question.

643
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.

644
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,820
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --

645
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,

646
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
as we'll all hear tomorrow.

647
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,820
I very much resonate with what you're saying,

648
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
because it seems to me that the problem

649
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,820
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging

650
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer

651
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?

652
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
(Laughter)

653
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
DG: For you or for them?

654
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
AdG: In persuading them.

655
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.

656
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.

657
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,820
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work

658
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,820
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.

659
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,820
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future

660
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,820
and the near future is that we imagine the near future

661
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
much more vividly than the far future.

662
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,820
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail

663
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,820
that people put into the mental representations

664
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
of near and far future, people begin to make decisions

665
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,820
about the two in the same way.

666
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,820
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65

667
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
is a question that's very different than,

668
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,820
imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,

669
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,820
what will you look like, how much hair will you have,

670
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
who will you be living with.

671
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,

672
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,820
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save

673
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,820
so that that guy has a little retirement money.

674
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
But these are tricks around the margins.

675
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,820
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,

676
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,820
which is to say, "I'm here today,

677
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,820
and so now is more important than later."

678
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,

679
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

680
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
(Applause)
