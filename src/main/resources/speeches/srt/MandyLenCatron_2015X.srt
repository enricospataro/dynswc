1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,236
I published this article

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,636
in the New York Times Modern Love column
in January of this year.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,996
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,316
And the article
is about a psychological study

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,756
designed to create romantic love
in the laboratory,

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,516
and my own experience
trying the study myself

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,396
one night last summer.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,156
So the procedure is fairly simple:

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,036
two strangers take turns asking each other
36 increasingly personal questions

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,956
and then they stare into each other's eyes

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,540
without speaking for four minutes.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,556
So here are a couple of sample questions.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,836
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow
having gained any one quality or ability,

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,060
what would it be?

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,756
Number 28: When did you last cry
in front of another person?

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,996
By yourself?

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,276
As you can see, they really do
get more personal as they go along.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,676
Number 30, I really like this one:

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,556
Tell your partner
what you like about them;

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,436
be very honest this time,

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,820
saying things you might not say
to someone you just met.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,196
So when I first came across this study
a few years earlier,

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,316
one detail really stuck out to me,

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,396
and that was the rumor
that two of the participants

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,916
had gotten married six months later,

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,116
and they'd invited the entire lab
to the ceremony.

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,996
So I was of course very skeptical

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,676
about this process of just
manufacturing romantic love,

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,556
but of course I was intrigued.

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,996
And when I got the chance
to try this study myself,

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,156
with someone I knew
but not particularly well,

32
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,316
I wasn't expecting to fall in love.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,036
But then we did, and --

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,956
(Laughter)

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,356
And I thought it made a good story,
so I sent it to the Modern Love column

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,196
a few months later.

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,940
Now, this was published in January,

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,396
and now it is August,

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,036
so I'm guessing that some of you
are probably wondering,

40
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,436
are we still together?

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,835
And the reason I think
you might be wondering this

42
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,516
is because I have been asked this question

43
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,476
again and again and again
for the past seven months.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,196
And this question is really
what I want to talk about today.

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,676
But let's come back to it.

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,676
(Laughter)

47
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,676
So the week before the article came out,

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,396
I was very nervous.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,996
I had been working
on a book about love stories

50
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,836
for the past few years,

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,676
so I had gotten used to writing
about my own experiences

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,716
with romantic love on my blog.

53
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,316
But a blog post might get
a couple hundred views at the most,

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,436
and those were usually
just my Facebook friends,

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,036
and I figured my article
in the New York Times

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,860
would probably get a few thousand views.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,676
And that felt like a lot of attention

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,876
on a relatively new relationship.

59
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,180
But as it turned out, I had no idea.

60
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,956
So the article was published online

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,036
on a Friday evening,

62
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,196
and by Saturday, this had happened
to the traffic on my blog.

63
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,100
And by Sunday, both the Today Show
and Good Morning America had called.

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,076
Within a month, the article
would receive over 8 million views,

65
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,396
and I was, to say the least,

66
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,316
underprepared for this sort of attention.

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,316
It's one thing to work up
the confidence to write honestly

68
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,436
about your experiences with love,

69
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,916
but it is another thing to discover

70
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,916
that your love life
has made international news --

71
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,156
(Laughter)

72
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,996
and to realize
that people across the world

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,996
are genuinely invested
in the status of your new relationship.

74
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,196
(Laughter)

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,036
And when people called or emailed,
which they did every day for weeks,

76
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,396
they always asked the same question first:

77
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,076
are you guys still together?

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,436
In fact, as I was preparing this talk,

79
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,716
I did a quick search of my email inbox

80
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,676
for the phrase "Are you still together?"

81
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,396
and several messages
popped up immediately.

82
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,075
They were from students and journalists

83
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,116
and friendly strangers like this one.

84
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,596
I did radio interviews and they asked.

85
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,556
I even gave a talk, and one woman
shouted up to the stage,

86
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,916
"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,236
And I promptly turned bright red.

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,076
I understand that this
is part of the deal.

89
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,636
If you write about your relationship
in an international newspaper,

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,316
you should expect people
to feel comfortable asking about it.

91
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,276
But I just wasn't prepared
for the scope of the response.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,156
The 36 questions seem
to have taken on a life of their own.

93
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,596
In fact, the New York Times
published a follow-up article

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,836
for Valentine's Day,

95
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,356
which featured readers' experiences
of trying the study themselves,

96
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,660
with varying degrees of success.

97
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,996
So my first impulse
in the face of all of this attention

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,460
was to become very protective
of my own relationship.

99
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,756
I said no to every request
for the two of us

100
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,116
to do a media appearance together.

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,836
I turned down TV interviews,

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,996
and I said no to every request
for photos of the two us.

103
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,596
I think I was afraid that we would become

104
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,756
inadvertent icons
for the process of falling in love,

105
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,500
a position I did not at all
feel qualified for.

106
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,036
And I get it:

107
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,836
people didn't just want to know
if the study worked,

108
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,796
they wanted to know if it really worked:

109
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,516
that is, if it was capable
of producing love that would last,

110
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,916
not just a fling, but real love,
sustainable love.

111
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,036
But this was a question
I didn't feel capable of answering.

112
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,756
My own relationship
was only a few months old,

113
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,540
and I felt like people were asking
the wrong question in the first place.

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,996
What would knowing whether or not
we were still together really tell them?

115
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,676
If the answer was no,

116
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,676
would it make the experience
of doing these 36 questions

117
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,900
any less worthwhile?

118
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,396
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote
about these questions

119
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,796
in this study here in 1997,

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,556
and here, the researcher's goal
was not to produce romantic love.

121
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,516
Instead, they wanted to foster

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,996
interpersonal closeness
among college students,

123
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,756
by using what Aron called

124
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,676
"sustained, escalating, reciprocal,
personalistic self-disclosure."

125
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,180
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?

126
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,076
But the study did work.

127
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,156
The participants
did feel closer after doing it,

128
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,476
and several subsequent studies have also
used Aron's fast friends protocol

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,636
as a way to quickly create
trust and intimacy between strangers.

130
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,089
They've used it between members
of the police and members of community,

131
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,673
and they've used it between people
of opposing political ideologies.

132
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,396
The original version of the story,

133
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,916
the one that I tried last summer,

134
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,156
that pairs the personal questions
with four minutes of eye contact,

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,276
was referenced in this article,

136
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,900
but unfortunately it was never published.

137
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,476
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk

138
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,796
at a small liberal arts college,

139
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,516
and a student came up to me afterwards

140
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,460
and he said, kind of shyly,

141
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,196
"So, I tried your study,
and it didn't work."

142
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,476
He seemed a little mystified by this.

143
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,276
"You mean, you didn't fall in love
with the person you did it with?" I asked.

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,716
"Well..." He paused.

145
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,220
"I think she just wants to be friends."

146
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,036
"But did you become
better friends?" I asked.

147
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,716
"Did you feel like you got to really
know each other after doing the study?"

148
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,036
He nodded.

149
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,996
"So, then it worked," I said.

150
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,236
I don't think this is the answer
he was looking for.

151
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,596
In fact, I don't think this is the answer
that any of us are looking for

152
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,876
when it comes to love.

153
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,636
I first came across this study

154
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,116
when I was 29

155
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,556
and I was going through
a really difficult breakup.

156
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,196
I had been in the relationship
since I was 20,

157
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,996
which was basically my entire adult life,

158
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,116
and he was my first real love,

159
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,236
and I had no idea how or if
I could make a life without him.

160
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,636
So I turned to science.

161
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,236
I researched everything I could find
about the science of romantic love,

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,356
and I think I was hoping that it might
somehow inoculate me from heartache.

163
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,020
I don't know if I realized
this at the time --

164
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,236
I thought I was just doing research
for this book I was writing --

165
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,676
but it seems really obvious in retrospect.

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,116
I hoped that if I armed myself
with the knowledge of romantic love,

167
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,780
I might never have to feel
as terrible and lonely as I did then.

168
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,436
And all this knowledge
has been useful in some ways.

169
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,756
I am more patient with love.
I am more relaxed.

170
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,356
I am more confident
about asking for what I want.

171
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,116
But I can also see myself more clearly,

172
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,396
and I can see that what I want
is sometimes more

173
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,476
than can reasonably be asked for.

174
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,956
What I want from love is a guarantee,

175
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,196
not just that I am loved today

176
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,636
and that I will be loved tomorrow,

177
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,860
but that I will continue to be loved
by the person I love indefinitely.

178
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,556
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee

179
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,556
that people were really asking about

180
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,300
when they wanted to know
if we were still together.

181
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,556
So the story that the media told
about the 36 questions

182
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,876
was that there might be
a shortcut to falling in love.

183
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,636
There might be a way to somehow
mitigate some of the risk involved,

184
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,276
and this is a very appealing story,

185
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,476
because falling in love feels amazing,

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,236
but it's also terrifying.

187
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,836
The moment you admit to loving someone,

188
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,500
you admit to having a lot to lose,

189
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,676
and it's true that these questions
do provide a mechanism

190
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,996
for getting to know someone quickly,

191
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,556
which is also a mechanism for being known,

192
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,036
and I think this is the thing
that most of us really want from love:

193
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,140
to be known, to be seen, to be understood.

194
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,956
But I think when it comes to love,

195
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,476
we are too willing to accept
the short version of the story.

196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,076
The version of the story that asks,
"Are you still together?"

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,220
and is content with a yes or no answer.

198
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,316
So rather than that question,

199
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,996
I would propose we ask
some more difficult questions,

200
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,220
questions like:

201
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,916
How do you decide who deserves your love

202
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,180
and who does not?

203
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,916
How do you stay in love
when things get difficult,

204
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,460
and how do you know
when to just cut and run?

205
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,596
How do you live with the doubt

206
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,636
that inevitably creeps
into every relationship,

207
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,276
or even harder,

208
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,660
how do you live with your partner's doubt?

209
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,236
I don't necessarily know
the answers to these questions,

210
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,396
but I think they're an important start
at having a more thoughtful conversation

211
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,580
about what it means to love someone.

212
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,236
So, if you want it,

213
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,556
the short version of the story
of my relationship is this:

214
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,676
a year ago, an acquaintance
and I did a study

215
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,396
designed to create romantic love,

216
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,116
and we fell in love,

217
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,996
and we are still together,

218
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,180
and I am so glad.

219
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,620
But falling in love is not
the same thing as staying in love.

220
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,660
Falling in love is the easy part.

221
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,556
So at the end of my article, I wrote,
"Love didn't happen to us.

222
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,876
We're in love because we each
made the choice to be."

223
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,076
And I cringe a little
when I read that now,

224
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,396
not because it isn't true,

225
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,636
but because at the time,
I really hadn't considered

226
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,276
everything that was contained
in that choice.

227
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,516
I didn't consider how many times
we would each have to make that choice,

228
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,116
and how many times I will continue
to have to make that choice

229
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,956
without knowing whether or not
he will always choose me.

230
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,476
I want it to be enough to have asked
and answered 36 questions,

231
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,716
and to have chosen to love someone
so generous and kind and fun

232
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,740
and to have broadcast that choice
in the biggest newspaper in America.

233
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,796
But what I have done instead
is turn my relationship

234
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,996
into the kind of myth
I don't quite believe in.

235
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,276
And what I want, what perhaps
I will spend my life wanting,

236
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,996
is for that myth to be true.

237
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,796
I want the happy ending
implied by the title to my article,

238
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,316
which is, incidentally,

239
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,996
the only part of the article
that I didn't actually write.

240
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,316
(Laughter)

241
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,036
But what I have instead is the chance
to make the choice to love someone,

242
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,516
and the hope that he will choose
to love me back,

243
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,236
and it is terrifying,

244
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,996
but that's the deal with love.

245
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,260
Thank you.
