1
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:15,495
I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,

2
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,567
I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,

3
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:21,934
and I'm especially interested in a possibility of

4
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:26,666
making our brains smarter, better and faster.

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,542
This is in this context I'm going to tell you

6
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,292
about video games. When we say video games,

7
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,830
most of you think about children.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,808
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.

9
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,726
But let's be frank.

10
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:46,515
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?

11
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:52,999
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,

12
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,006
not eight years old, and in fact, if we look

13
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,715
at the projected demographics of video game play,

14
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:02,448
the video game players of tomorrow are

15
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:05,572
older adults. (Laughter)

16
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:09,823
So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.

17
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:14,206
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact

18
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,593
on our everyday life. Consider these statistics

19
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:23,408
released by Activision. After one month of release

20
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:27,900
of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,273
for 68,000 years

22
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,139
worldwide, right?

23
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,086
Would any of you complain if this was the case

24
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,249
about doing linear algebra?

25
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:43,544
So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?

26
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,392
Now I want to step back a bit.

27
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:48,633
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back

28
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:53,353
home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.

29
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:55,493
(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get

30
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:58,457
after your enemy zombie bad guys

31
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:02,047
before they get to you, right?

32
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:05,224
And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,

33
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,545
"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent

34
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,872
than shooting at zombies?"

35
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:15,338
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction

36
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:17,835
in the context of what you would have thought

37
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:21,344
if you had found your girl playing sudoku

38
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:25,695
or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?

39
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,432
Most parents would find that great.

40
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,776
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games

41
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,744
days in and days out is actually good for your health.

42
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:37,944
It's not, and binging is never good.

43
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:41,935
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,

44
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:44,904
actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,

45
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,488
those action-packed shooter games

46
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:51,264
have quite powerful effects and positive effects

47
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,122
on many different aspects of our behavior.

48
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:58,817
There's not one week that goes without some major

49
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,593
headlines in the media about whether video games are

50
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:06,209
good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.

51
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,897
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside

52
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:15,040
and get you to actually step into the lab.

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,913
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,

54
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,680
in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,449
of video games on the brain.

56
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,784
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.

57
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,383
One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard

58
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,669
is the fact that too much screen time

59
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,484
makes your eyesight worse.

60
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,687
That's a statement about vision.

61
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,223
There may be vision scientists among you.

62
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:42,162
We actually know how to test that statement.

63
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:45,599
We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.

64
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,270
of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time

66
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,802
in front of screens, have normal, or what we call

67
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,456
corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.

68
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:00,905
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually

69
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:04,185
indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,

70
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:06,060
10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.

71
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,288
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?

72
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,985
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.

73
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,425
It's better than those that don't play.

74
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,697
And it's better in two different ways.

75
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:19,122
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve

76
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:22,377
small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means

77
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:26,175
being able to read the fine print on a prescription

78
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:30,802
rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it

79
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,368
with just your eyesight.

80
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:35,184
The other way that they are better is actually being able

81
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:38,093
to resolve different levels of gray.

82
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:41,264
Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference

83
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,745
between seeing the car in front of you

84
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:47,488
and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.

85
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,504
So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games

86
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:54,978
for patients with low vision, and to have an impact

87
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,313
on retraining their brain to see better.

88
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,962
Clearly, when it comes to action video games,

89
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,857
screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.

90
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:08,843
Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:

91
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:13,217
Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.

92
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:17,122
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.

93
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:20,723
I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.

94
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:23,448
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have

95
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,472
to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you

96
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:31,905
colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.

97
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,288
Right? So this is the first example.

98
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,378
["Chair"]

99
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,439
Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.

100
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,819
["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.

101
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,113
["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.

102
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:43,438
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.

103
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:44,947
["Blue"] DB: Yellow.

104
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:51,302
Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)

105
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:54,638
You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?

106
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:58,592
Because I introduced a conflict between

107
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,505
the word itself and its color.

108
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:04,544
How good your attention is determines actually how fast

109
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,071
you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here

110
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,632
at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better

111
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,176
than some of us that are older.

112
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,744
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task

113
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,344
with people that play a lot of action games,

114
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:19,664
they actually resolve the conflict faster.

115
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:22,872
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead

116
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,355
to attention problems.

117
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:27,326
Actually, those action video game players have

118
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,643
many other advantages in terms of attention, and one

119
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,542
aspect of attention which is also improved for the better

120
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:37,320
is our ability to track objects around in the world.

121
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,864
This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,

122
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:43,112
you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.

123
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,187
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,

124
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:49,240
and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?

125
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,304
In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,

126
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:54,384
sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them

127
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:57,280
little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,232
You're going to see yellow happy faces

129
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:04,048
and a few sad blue faces. These are children

130
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,868
in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess

131
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:12,169
during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.

132
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:15,296
But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.

133
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:18,616
Everybody begins to move around, and your task

134
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:21,740
is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,231
and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example

136
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,060
where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can

137
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,397
actually track it with your eyes. You can track,

138
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,677
you can track, and then when it stops, and there is

139
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:35,608
a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?

140
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:38,436
Was it yellow initially or blue?

141
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:42,233
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)

142
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:47,029
I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with

143
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,117
a little more challenging task. There are going to be

144
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,300
three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,553
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated

146
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:57,199
and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way

147
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,047
you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.

148
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,510
Yellow or blue?

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,156
Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.

150
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:05,659
So your typical normal young adult

151
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,295
can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.

152
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,055
That's what we just did. Your action video game player

153
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:15,255
has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,

154
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:18,233
which is what is shown in this video here.

155
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:21,709
That's for you guys, action video game players.

156
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,594
A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)

157
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:27,302
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people

158
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:30,506
that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

159
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:34,110
Good. So in the same way that we actually see

160
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,588
the effects of video games on people's behavior,

161
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:40,653
we can use brain imaging and look at the impact

162
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,438
of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,

163
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:47,798
but the main changes are actually to the brain networks

164
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:52,342
that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex

165
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:56,061
which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.

166
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,494
The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls

167
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,204
how we sustain attention, and another one

168
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:03,773
is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate

169
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:07,070
and regulate attention and resolve conflict.

170
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,934
Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three

171
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:13,278
of these networks are actually much more efficient

172
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,038
in people that play action games.

173
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,789
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding

174
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,230
in the literature about technology and the brain.

175
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,679
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty

176
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,889
of multitasking when you're driving

177
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,580
and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.

178
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,483
Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,

179
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:43,631
you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly

180
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:46,079
to the car braking in front of you, and so you're

181
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,650
much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.

182
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,526
Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.

183
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,998
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see

184
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:59,343
how many car accidents they have. That would be a little

185
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:02,890
costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer

186
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,008
where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,

187
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:10,536
how good they are at switching from one task to another.

188
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:13,104
When we do that, we actually find that people

189
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:16,188
that play a lot of action games are really, really good.

190
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:20,671
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.

191
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,329
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it

192
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,061
in the context of another group of technology users,

193
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,471
a group which is actually much revered by society,

194
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:34,010
which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.

195
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,655
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,

196
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:40,936
most of our children, are engaged with listening to music

197
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,683
at the same time as they're doing search on the web

198
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:47,040
at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.

199
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,376
That's a multimedia-tasker.

200
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:52,936
There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford

201
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:55,489
and that we replicated that showed that

202
00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:00,136
those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers

203
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:03,983
are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.

204
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,720
When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.

205
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,426
Right? So these kinds of results really

206
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:11,912
makes two main points.

207
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:15,104
The first one is that not all media are created equal.

208
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:20,016
You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking

209
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,662
and the effect of playing action games. They have

210
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:25,054
totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,

211
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:28,168
perception and attention.

212
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:31,008
Even within video games, I'm telling you right now

213
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:32,761
about these action-packed video games.

214
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,095
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.

215
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,777
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure

216
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:41,288
what is the effect of each video game.

217
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:45,575
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.

218
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:48,631
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that

219
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,079
despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers

220
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,087
have a lot of very good vision, etc.

221
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:58,405
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates

222
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:01,646
that actually report engaging in a lot of high

223
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:06,623
multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.

224
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,913
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad

225
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:11,599
and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have

226
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,455
this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.

227
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:18,400
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab

228
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,992
and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.

229
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:26,575
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect

230
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,055
of video games on the brain, it's very similar

231
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,919
to the effect of wine on the health.

232
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,959
There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some

233
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,175
very poor uses of video games. But when consumed

234
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:43,656
in reasonable doses, and at the right age,

235
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,927
wine can be very good for health. There are actually

236
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:50,191
specific molecules that have been identified

237
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:56,023
in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.

238
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:59,295
So it's the same way, like those action video games

239
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,957
have a number of ingredients that are actually really

240
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:04,927
powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,

241
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:08,532
vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on

242
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,287
understanding what are those active ingredients so that

243
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,177
we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,

244
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:19,420
either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.

245
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,199
Now because we are interested in having an impact

246
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,687
for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually

247
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:29,103
not that interested in how those of you that choose

248
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:32,975
to play video games for many hours on end perform.

249
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm much more interested in taking any of you

250
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,580
and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,

251
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,443
I can actually change your vision for the better,

252
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,774
whether you want to play that action game or not, right?

253
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,190
That's the point of rehabilitation or education.

254
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,116
Most of the kids don't go to school saying,

255
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,856
"Great, two hours of math!"

256
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:57,295
So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,

257
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,759
we need to go one more step.

258
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,783
And one more step is to do training studies.

259
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:06,183
So let me illustrate that step with

260
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:09,751
a task which is called mental rotation.

261
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:13,926
Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,

262
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,811
and again you're going to do the task,

263
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,496
to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,

264
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,750
and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.

265
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,590
One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated

266
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,894
version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:

267
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:34,735
the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?

268
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:37,152
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.

269
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:41,682
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.

270
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:46,656
That's our target shape.

271
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:50,359
Third. Good! This is hard, right?

272
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,846
Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because

273
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:54,580
you really feel your brain cringing, right?

274
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,012
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.

275
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:00,717
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people

276
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,326
come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,

277
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:07,656
we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.

278
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,402
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.

279
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:13,512
They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes

280
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,813
several days over a period of two weeks.

281
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,609
Then, once they are done with the training, they come back

282
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:23,582
a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type

283
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:27,198
of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague

284
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,733
in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,

285
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,931
you know, subjects perform where they are expected

286
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,141
to perform given their age. After two weeks of training

287
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:40,997
on action video games, they actually perform better,

288
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:46,353
and the improvement is still there five months after

289
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:49,221
having done the training. That's really, really important.

290
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:51,701
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games

291
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,901
for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects

292
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,837
that are going to be long-lasting.

293
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,690
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering

294
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,323
well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market

295
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:06,875
a game that would be good for the attention

296
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,395
of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,

297
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,978
or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision

298
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:16,787
of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?

299
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:21,267
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.

300
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,178
There are brain scientists like me that are beginning

301
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,435
to understand what are the good ingredients in games

302
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,540
to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going

303
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,114
to call the broccoli side of the equation.

304
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:36,850
There is an entertainment software industry

305
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,322
which is extremely deft at coming up with

306
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:44,466
appealing products that you can't resist.

307
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,994
That's the chocolate side of the equation.

308
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:51,018
The issue is we need to put the two together,

309
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,274
and it's a little bit like with food.

310
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:56,915
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?

311
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,174
None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had

312
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:01,506
that feeling, right, picking up an education game

313
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:04,898
and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,

314
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,315
it's not really engaging. So what we need

315
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:10,666
is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate

316
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,677
that is irresistible, that you really want to play,

317
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,662
but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients

318
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,890
that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize

319
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,729
but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,

320
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:28,205
but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,

321
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:31,168
people that work in the entertainment software industry,

322
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,906
and publishers, so these are not people that usually

323
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,243
meet every day, but it's actually doable,

324
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:38,890
and we are on the right track.

325
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,672
I'd like to leave you with that thought,

326
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:44,039
and thank you for your attention. (Applause)

327
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,039
(Applause)
