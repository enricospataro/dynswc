1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
We're entering a second generation of no progress

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,820
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
to go out and continue this very important thing

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
that we as a species have always done.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
And that is, instinctively we've gone out

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,820
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,820
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
And I feel very strongly

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,820
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,820
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version

13
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
of a cell phone with a video in it.

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,820
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,820
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and help us survive in the future.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,820
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,820
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
(Laughter)

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
What we're looking forward to is --

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,820
(Applause)

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
what we're looking forward to

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
is not only the inspiration of our children,

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,820
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,820
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,820
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,820
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?

30
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,820
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,820
the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,820
is that right back to where we inspire people

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
who will be our great leaders later.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,820
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,820
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,820
What they look at is the most important thing.

39
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period

41
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
when marvelous things happened.

42
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,

43
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,820
"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,820
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,820
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.

50
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
The ones that flew and landed OK

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
because there were no trained pilots

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
who had good flying qualities by definition.

53
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,820
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts

55
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,

56
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
That has not happened at all in space flying.

58
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,820
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Well, who was inspired during that time period?

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,820
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them

63
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,820
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.

64
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting

68
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,820
we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?

70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
and they've landed it only in the deserts.

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
(Laughter)

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,820
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,

74
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters

75
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
and the blue line is commercial air transport.

76
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --

77
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,820
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,820
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.

79
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?

80
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing

81
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,820
and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War

83
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.

84
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
that people could build in their garages.

86
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them

87
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,

88
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
which is my company now.

89
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,820
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.

90
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.

91
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,820
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed

92
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,820
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.

93
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,820
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?

95
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,

96
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,820
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,

97
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
that's kind of cool.

99
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.

100
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,820
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

101
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

102
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,

103
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,820
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
These things tend to happen every 25 years.

105
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,820
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement

106
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --

107
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel

108
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,820
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,820
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.

110
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles

111
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
if the government develops and the government uses it.

112
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,820
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.

113
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

114
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,

115
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,820
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.

116
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --

117
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

118
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,820
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,

119
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned

120
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
space flights in the world -- the very first year.

121
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:55,820
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.

122
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
There were only three or four flights in 2003.

123
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,820
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights

124
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave

125
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
with my little group of a couple dozen people

126
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
in order to get to a total of five,

127
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,820
which was the number the same year back in 1961.

128
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,820
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.

129
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.

130
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
This is a picture here taken from orbit.

131
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.

132
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,820
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --

133
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage

135
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,820
to go out and try that as a small company.

136
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?

137
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,820
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.

138
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
There's another one announced just last week.

139
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,820
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital

140
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
is, there is not solutions for adequate safety

141
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,820
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
three governments have been doing this for 45 years,

143
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.

144
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,820
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.

145
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,820
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.

146
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I can't tell you when this will start,

147
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.

148
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,820
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,

149
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.

150
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon

151
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

152
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --

153
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.

154
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.

155
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
(Laughter)

156
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending

157
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,820
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,820
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."

159
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,

160
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,820
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978

161
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,820
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.

162
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,820
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.

163
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
(Laughter)

164
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,

165
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
but the home computer was for games.

166
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,820
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.

167
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,820
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,

168
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
big development, big improvement and capability and so on,

169
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,820
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.

170
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
And the inventor is in this audience.

171
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,

172
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,820
a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,

174
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
our communication and, if we let the Google guys

175
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)

176
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,820
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.

178
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
So fun is defendable.

179
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,820
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,

180
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.

181
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
And in it also brings up another point, right here.

182
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,820
There's a group of people that have come forward --

183
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward

184
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,820
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,

185
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,

186
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
right in this time period.

187
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,

188
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,820
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,

189
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.

190
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,820
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,

191
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area

192
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,820
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --

193
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,820
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,

194
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
and it will lead us into the next really big thing

195
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually

196
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.

197
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,820
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.

198
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
There were a couple of examples here.

199
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane

200
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,820
was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,

201
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,820
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.

202
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
It went a whole life cycle without competition,

203
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
took out of service. And we're stuck back here

204
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
with the same kind of capability for military fighters

205
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,820
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.

206
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.

207
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,

208
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
or if you've got a 10-year-old now.

209
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,820
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.

210
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket

211
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,820
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance

212
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,820
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.

213
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,820
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance

214
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;

215
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
why do you need something better?

216
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying

217
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,

218
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters

219
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

220
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,820
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.

221
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,820
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.

222
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,820
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,

223
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
because we lost the first two milestones.

224
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware

225
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,820
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --

226
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
you can argue that's not a technical loss.

227
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.

228
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,820
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,

229
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
and that was a very strong thing.

230
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,820
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,

231
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,820
not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.

232
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:13,820
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.

233
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost

234
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.

235
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,820
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --

236
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,820
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.

237
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available

238
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
because a Russian space program is starving,

239
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,820
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.

240
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,820
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip

241
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,820
to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.

242
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.

243
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,

244
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
when the space race was going on,

245
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,820
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do

246
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?

247
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,

248
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,820
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,

249
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,820
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese

250
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,820
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.

252
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:35,820
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,

253
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,820
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.

254
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,820
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.

255
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,820
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.

256
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel

257
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,820
when the commercial stuff is offered.

258
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.

259
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
This little thing says here: five times

260
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:11,820
what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already

261
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,820
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion

262
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,820
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --

263
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,820
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,

264
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that

265
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,820
being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed

266
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.

267
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,820
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --

268
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,820
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars

269
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,820
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,

270
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,820
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.

271
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this

272
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,820
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer

273
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,820
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,820
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently

275
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,820
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,

276
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,820
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,

277
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,820
will be at a level of about five times as much

278
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,820
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.

279
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:43,820
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.

280
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,820
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --

281
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,

282
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,820
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.

283
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,820
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,

284
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,820
and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it

285
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,820
because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,

286
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,820
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,

287
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

288
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
OK, thank you very much.

289
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
(Applause)
