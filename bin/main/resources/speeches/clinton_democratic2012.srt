1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:07,059
Thank you. Now, Mr. Mayor, fellow Democrats,
we are here to nominate a president.

2
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,279
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
And I’ve got one in mind.

3
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,140
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
I want to nominate a man whose own life has

4
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:40,014
known its fair share of adversity and uncertainty.
I want to nominate a man who ran for president

5
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:47,089
to change the course of an already weak economy
and then just six weeks before his election,

6
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:53,019
saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the
Great Depression. A man who stopped the slide

7
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:59,985
into depression and put us on the long road
to recovery, knowing all the while that no

8
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,700
matter how, no matter how, many jobs that
he saved or created, there’d still be millions

9
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:13,007
more waiting, worried about feeding their
own kids, trying to keep their hopes alive.

10
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,370
I want to nominate a man who’s cool on the
outside…

11
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:26,469
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
…but who burns for America on the inside.

12
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:33,889
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
I want, I want a man who believes with no

13
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:44,697
doubt that we can build a new American Dream
economy, driven by innovation and creativity,

14
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:52,399
but education and, yes, by cooperation.
And by the way, after last night, I want a

15
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,880
man who had the good sense to marry Michelle
Obama.

16
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:02,088
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
You know…

17
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,985
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
I…

18
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,039
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
…I want, I want Barack Obama to be the next

19
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:24,078
president of the United States.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

20
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:31,078
And I proudly nominate him to be the standard-bearer
of the Democratic Party.

21
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:40,078
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
Now, folks, in Tampa a few days ago, we heard

22
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,140
a lot of talk.
[LAUGHTER]

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
All about how the president and the Democrats
don’t really believe in free enterprise

24
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:54,068
and individual initiative, how we want everybody
to be dependent on the government, how bad

25
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:59,159
we are for the economy.
This Republican narrative, this alternative

26
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,038
universe…
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

27
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:09,569
…says that every one of us in this room
who amounts to anything, we’re all completely

28
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:16,093
self-made. One of the greatest chairmen the
Democratic Party ever had, Bob Strauss…

29
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:22,648
[CHEERS]
…used to say that ever politician wants

30
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,760
every voter to believe he was born in a log
cabin he built himself.

31
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:33,076
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERS]
But, as Strauss then admitted, it ain’t

32
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,510
so.
[LAUGHTER]

33
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:44,060
We Democrats, we think the country works better
with a strong middle class, with real opportunities

34
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,577
for poor folks to work their way into it with
a relentless focus on the future, with business

35
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,870
and government actually working together to
promote growth and broadly share prosperity.

36
00:03:55,087 --> 00:04:01,140
You see, we believe that “we’re all in
this together” is a far better philosophy

37
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:09,004
than “you’re on your own.”
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

38
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,471
Now.
[CLEARS THROAT]

39
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,762
So who’s right?
[CHEERS]

40
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:30,599
Well, since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans
have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats,

41
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:44,005
24. In those 52 years, our private economy
has produced 66 million private sector jobs.

42
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:55,002
So what’s the job score? Republicans, 24
million; Democrats, 42.

43
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:04,191
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Now, there’s…

44
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:12,091
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
…there’s a reason for this. It turns out

45
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:20,003
that advancing equal opportunity and economic
empowerment is both morally right and good

46
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,949
economics. Why? Because poverty, discrimination
and ignorance restrict growth.

47
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:33,053
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
When you stifle human potential, when you

48
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:38,094
don’t invest in new ideas, it doesn’t
just cut off the people who are affected;

49
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:41,187
it hurts us all.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

50
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:47,175
We know that investments in education and
infrastructure and scientific and technological

51
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:53,133
research increase growth. They increase good
jobs, and they create new wealth for all the

52
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:57,121
rest of us.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

53
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:05,021
Now, there’s something I’ve noticed lately.
You probably have too. And it’s this. I,

54
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:13,592
I..maybe just because I grew up in a different
time, but though I often disagree with Republicans,

55
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,954
I actually never learned to hate them the
way the far right that now controls their

56
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,539
party seems to hate our president and a lot
of other Democrats. I…

57
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:32,071
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
…that would be impossible for me because

58
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,676
President Eisenhower sent federal troops to
my home state to integrate Little Rock Central

59
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:39,990
High School.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

60
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,518
President Eisenhower built the interstate
highway system.

61
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:49,180
When I was a governor, I worked with President
Reagan and his White House on the first round

62
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:55,027
of welfare reform and with President George
H.W. Bush on national education goals.

63
00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:01,060
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
I’m actually very grateful to…if you saw

64
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:06,175
from the film what I do today, I have to be
grateful, and you should be, too, that President

65
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,550
George W. Bush supported PEPFAR. It saved
the lives of millions of people in poor countries.

66
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:16,121
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
And I have been honored to work with both

67
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:22,050
Presidents Bush on natural disasters in the
aftermath of the South Asian tsunami, Hurricane

68
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:28,264
Katrina, the horrible earthquake in Haiti.
Through my foundation, both in America and

69
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,560
around the world, I’m working all the time
with Democrats, Republicans and independents.

70
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:36,635
Sometimes I couldn’t tell you for the life
who I’m working with because we focus on

71
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,800
solving problems and seizing opportunities
and not fighting all the time.

72
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:48,008
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
And so here’s what I want to say to you,

73
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:57,128
and here’s what I want the people at home
to think about. When times are tough and people

74
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:05,028
are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain,
the politics of constant conflict may be good.

75
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:11,137
But what is good politics does not necessarily
work in the real world. What works in the

76
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:16,042
real world is cooperation.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

77
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:23,087
What works in the real world is cooperation,
business and government, foundations and universities.

78
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,550
Ask the mayors who are here.
[ISOLATED CHEERS]

79
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:39,087
Los Angeles is getting green and Chicago is
getting an infrastructure bank because Republicans

80
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:42,091
and Democrats are working together to get
it.

81
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,162
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
They didn’t check their brains at the door.

82
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:49,063
They didn’t stop disagreeing, but their
purpose was to get something done.

83
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:54,071
Now, why is this true? Why does cooperation
work better than constant conflict?

84
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:59,105
Because nobody’s right all the time, and
a broken clock is right twice a day.

85
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:07,005
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
And every one of us, every one of us and every

86
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:12,095
one of them, we’re compelled to spend our
fleeting lives between those two extremes,

87
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:17,075
knowing we’re never going to be right all
the time and hoping we’re right more than

88
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,092
twice a day.
[LAUGHTER]

89
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:24,134
Unfortunately, the faction that now dominates
the Republican Party doesn’t see it that

90
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:30,113
way. They think government is always the enemy,
they’re always right, and compromise is

91
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,072
weakness.
[JEERS]

92
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,080
Just in the last couple of elections, they
defeated two distinguished Republican senators

93
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:43,058
because they dared to cooperate with Democrats
on issues important to the future of the country,

94
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:45,137
even national security.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

95
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:52,043
They beat a Republican congressman with almost
a hundred percent voting record on every conservative

96
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:56,160
score, because he said he realized he did
not have to hate the president to disagree

97
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:00,079
with him. Boy, that was a nonstarter, and
they threw him out.

98
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:06,038
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS]
One of the main reasons we ought to re-elect

99
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:13,038
President Obama is that he is still committed
to constructive cooperation.

100
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:18,082
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
Look at his record. Look at his record.

101
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:24,039
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
Look at his record. He appointed Republican

102
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,042
secretaries of defense, the Army and transportation.
He appointed a vice president who ran against

103
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:36,134
him in 2008. And he trusted that vice president
to oversee the successful end of the war in

104
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:40,108
Iraq and the implementation of the recovery
act.

105
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:48,008
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
And Joe Biden, Joe Biden did a great job with

106
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:57,066
both.
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

107
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:02,119
Now..
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

108
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,100
…he…
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

109
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
President Obama, President Obama appointed
several members of his Cabinet even though

110
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:20,089
they supported Hillary in the primary.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

111
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:27,089
Heck, he even appointed Hillary.
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

112
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:42,013
Wait a minute. I am…
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

113
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:47,122
…I am very proud of her. I am proud of the
job she and the national security team have

114
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:51,105
done for America.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

115
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:56,101
I am grateful that they have worked together
to make us safer and stronger, to build a

116
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:03,016
world with more partners and fewer enemies.
I’m grateful for the relationship of respect

117
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:09,033
and partnership she and the president have
enjoyed and the signal that sends to the rest

118
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:13,076
of the world, that democracy does not have
a blood, have to be a blood sport, it can

119
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:17,173
be an honorable enterprise that advances the
public interest.

120
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:24,110
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Now…

121
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:32,001
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE GROW]
…besides the national security team, I am

122
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:38,157
very grateful to the men and women who’ve
served our country in uniform through these

123
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:42,093
perilous times.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

124
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:49,093
And I am especially grateful to Michelle Obama
and to Joe Biden for supporting those military

125
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:57,093
families while their loved ones were overseas…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

126
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:04,023
…and for supporting our veterans when they
came home, when they came home bearing the

127
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:11,023
wounds of war or needing help to find education
or jobs or housing.

128
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:15,118
President Obama’s whole record on national
security is a tribute to his strength, to

129
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:23,018
his judgment and to his preference for inclusion
and partnership over partisanship. We need

130
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:30,003
more of it in Washington, D.C.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

131
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,098
Now, we all know that he also tried to work
with congressional Republicans on health care,

132
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:41,104
debt reduction and new jobs. And that didn’t
work out so well.

133
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:47,061
[LAUGHTER]
But it could have been because, as the Senate

134
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:54,061
Republican leader said in a remarkable moment
of candor two full years before the election,

135
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:59,179
their number one priority was not to put America
back to work; it was to put the president

136
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:07,079
out of work.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE, BOOS]

137
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:15,002
Well, wait a minute. Senator, I hate to break
it to you, but we’re going to keep President

138
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:22,036
Obama on the job.
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

139
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:43,077
Now, are you ready for that?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

140
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:44,155
Are you willing to work for it. Wait a minute.
[AUDIENCE] Four more years! Four more years!

141
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,089
Four more years! Four more years!
[PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON] In Tampa…

142
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,093
[AUDIENCE] Four more years! Four more years!
[PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON]

143
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,118
…in Tampa, in Tampa, did y’all watch their
convention? I did.

144
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,020
[LAUGHTER]
In Tampa, the Republican argument against

145
00:14:55,038 --> 00:15:00,137
the president’s re-election was actually
pretty simple, pretty snappy. It went something

146
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:07,081
like this: We left him a total mess. He hasn’t
cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and

147
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:14,081
put us back in.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

148
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:21,124
Now…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

149
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:28,027
…but they did it well. They looked good,
they sounded good. They convinced me that…

150
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:30,122
[LAUGHTER]
…they all love their families and their

151
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,100
children and were grateful they’d been born
in America and all that..

152
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,027
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
…really, I’m not being, they did!

153
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:42,029
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
And this is important, they convinced me they

154
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:45,074
were honorable people who believed what they
said and they’re going to keep every commitment

155
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:48,160
they’ve made. We just got to make sure the
American people know what those commitments

156
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:56,006
are…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

157
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,086
…because, because in order to look like
an acceptable, reasonable, moderate alternative

158
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:04,097
to President Obama, they just didn’t say
very much about the ideas they’ve offered

159
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:09,188
over the last two years.
They couldn’t. Because they want to the

160
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:14,163
same old policies that got us in trouble in
the first place. They want to cut taxes for

161
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:19,160
high-income Americans, even more than President
Bush did. They want to get rid of those pesky

162
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:25,047
financial regulations designed to prevent
another crash and prohibit future bailouts.

163
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:32,050
They want to actually increase defense spending
over a decade $2 trillion more than the Pentagon

164
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:39,005
has requested. Without saying what they’ll
spend it on. And they want to make enormous

165
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:43,072
cuts in the rest of the budget, especially
programs that help the middle class and poor

166
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:48,101
children.
As another president once said, there they

167
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:56,001
go again.
[LAUGHTER, SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

168
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:04,019
Now, I like, I like, I like the argument for
President Obama’s re-election a lot better.

169
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,799
Here it is. He inherited a deeply damaged
economy. He put a floor under the crash. He

170
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:27,180
began the long, hard road to recovery and
laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced

171
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,220
economy that will produce millions of good
new jobs, vibrant new businesses and lots

172
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,024
of new wealth for innovators.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

173
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:40,543
Now, are we where we want to be today? No.
[AUDIENCE] No!

174
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,768
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Is the president satisfied? Of course not.

175
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,970
[AUDIENCE MEMBERS] No!
[PRESIDENT CLINTON] But are we better off

176
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:50,156
than we were when he took office?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

177
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:57,450
And listen to this. Listen to this. Everybody’s
forgot…

178
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:03,087
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…everybody’s forgot when President Barack

179
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:09,149
Obama took office, the economy was in free
fall. It had just shrunk 9 full percent of

180
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,848
GDP. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month.
Are we doing better than that today?

181
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:14,361
[AUDIENCE MEMBERS] Yes!
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]

182
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:20,750
The answer is yes.
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] Yeah, Barack Obama!

183
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:26,854
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Now, look. Here’s the challenge he faces

184
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:33,534
and the challenge all of you who support him
face. I get it. I know it. I’ve been there.

185
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:41,029
A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated
about this economy. If you look at the numbers,

186
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:46,668
you know employment is growing, banks are
beginning to lend again. And in a lot of places,

187
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,570
housing prices are even beginning to pick
up.

188
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:56,057
But too many people do not feel it yet.
I had the same thing happen in 1994 and early

189
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:03,186
‘95. We could see that the policies were
working, that the economy was growing. But

190
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:11,086
most people didn’t feel it yet. Thankfully,
by 1996 the economy was roaring, everybody

191
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:18,584
felt it, and we were halfway through the longest
peacetime expansion in the history of the

192
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:22,923
United States. But…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

193
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:30,139
…wait, wait. The difference this time is
purely in the circumstances. President Obama

194
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:37,059
started with a much weaker economy than I
did. Listen to me, now. No president, no president,

195
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:47,909
not me, not any of my predecessors, no one
could have fully repaired all the damage that

196
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:56,011
he found in just four years.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

197
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:05,036
Now, but…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

198
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:12,999
…he has, he has laid the foundations for
a new, modern, successful economy of shared

199
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:21,047
prosperity. And if you will renew the president’s
contract, you will feel it. You will feel

200
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:27,292
it.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

201
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:31,990
Folks, whether the American people believe
what I just said or not may be the whole election.

202
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:38,099
I just want you to know that I believe it.
With all my heart, I believe it.

203
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:48,559
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Now, why do I believe it?

204
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:57,590
I’m fixin’ to tell you why. I believe
it because President Obama’s approach embodies

205
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:03,118
the values, the ideas and the direction America
has to take to build the 21st-century version

206
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:08,590
of the American Dream: a nation of shared
opportunities, shared responsibilities, shared

207
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:15,059
prosperity, a shared sense of community.
So let’s get back to the story. In 2010,

208
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:21,302
as the president’s recovery program kicked
in, the job losses stopped and things began

209
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:28,350
to turn around. The recovery act saved or
created millions of jobs and cut taxes. Let

210
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:34,564
me say this again, cut taxes for 95 percent
of the American people.

211
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:41,340
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
And, in the last 29 months, our economy has

212
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:46,098
produced about 4 1/2 million private sector
jobs.

213
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:51,627
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
We could have done better, but last year the

214
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:57,571
Republicans blocked the president’s job
plan, costing the economy more than a million

215
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:04,980
new jobs.
So here’s another job score. President Obama:

216
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:08,162
plus 4 1/2 million. Congressional Republicans:
zero.

217
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:15,961
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
During this period…

218
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:23,519
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…during this period, more than 500,000 manufacturing

219
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,898
jobs have been created under President Obama.
That’s the first time manufacturing jobs

220
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,080
have increased since the 1990s.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

221
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:36,237
And I’ll tell you something else. The auto
industry restructuring worked.

222
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,320
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
It saved — it saved more than a million

223
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:47,111
jobs, and not just at GM, Chrysler and their
dealerships but in auto parts manufacturing

224
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,440
all over the country. That’s why even the
automakers who weren’t part of the deal

225
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:59,809
supported it. They needed to save those parts
suppliers too. Like I said, we’re all in

226
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,870
this together.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

227
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:09,087
So what’s happened? There are now 250,000
more people working in the auto industry than

228
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:17,749
on the day the companies were restructured.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

229
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:26,279
So, now, we all know that Governor Romney
opposed the plan to save GM and Chrysler.

230
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:33,247
[BOOS]
So here’s another job score.

231
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,844
[LAUGHTER]
Are you listening in Michigan and Ohio and

232
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,567
across the country?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

233
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:47,490
Here, here’s another job score: Obama, 250,000;
Romney

234
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:53,968
[AUDIENCE AND CLINTON TOGETHER] Zero!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

235
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,420
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Now, the agreement the administration made

236
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,580
with the management, labor and environmental
groups to double car mileage, that was a good

237
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:09,129
deal too. It will cut your gas prices in half,
your gas bill. No matter what the price is,

238
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:14,074
if you double the mileage of your car, your
bill will be half what it would have been.

239
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:19,096
It will make us more energy independent. It
will cut greenhouse gas emissions. And according

240
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:23,805
to several analyses, over the next 20 years,
it’ll bring us another half a million good

241
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:31,669
new jobs into the American economy.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

242
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,590
The president’s energy strategy, which he
calls “all of the above,” is helping too.

243
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:42,074
The boom in oil and gas production, combined
with greater energy efficiency, has driven

244
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,610
oil imports to a near-20-year low and natural
gas production to an all-time high. And renewable

245
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:55,061
energy production has doubled.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

246
00:24:56,021 --> 00:25:03,021
Of course, we need a lot more new jobs. But
there are already more than 3 million jobs

247
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:12,619
open and unfilled in America, mostly because
the people who apply for them don’t yet

248
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:18,986
have the required skills to do them. So even
as we get Americans more jobs, we have to

249
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:24,690
prepare more Americans for the new jobs that
are actually going to be created. The old

250
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:29,268
economy is not coming back. We’ve got to
build a new one and educate people to do those

251
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:36,889
jobs.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

252
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:43,107
The president, the president and his education
secretary have supported community colleges

253
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:49,846
and employers in working together to train
people for jobs that are actually open in

254
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:55,600
their communities — and even more important
after a decade in which exploding college

255
00:25:55,006 --> 00:26:02,006
costs have increased the dropout rate so much
that the percentage of our young people with

256
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:09,072
four-year college degrees has gone down so
much that we have dropped to 16th in the world

257
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:14,168
in the percentage of young people with college
degrees.

258
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:21,429
So the president’s student loan is more
important than ever. Here’s what it does…

259
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:24,094
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…here’s what it does. You need to tell

260
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:28,182
every voter where you live about this. It
lowers the cost of federal student loans.

261
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:34,391
And even more important, it give students
the right to repay those loans as a clear,

262
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:39,700
fixed, low percentage of their income for
up to 20 years.

263
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:44,806
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Now what does this mean? What does this mean?

264
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:51,503
Think of it. It means no one will ever have
to drop out of college again for fear they

265
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:58,899
can’t repay their debt.
And it means…

266
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,121
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…it means that if someone wants to take

267
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:08,032
a job with a modest income, a teacher, a police
officer, if they want to be a small-town doctor

268
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:13,331
in a little rural area, they won’t have
to turn those jobs down because they don’t

269
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:18,960
pay enough to repay they debt. Their debt
obligation will be determined by their salary.

270
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:24,195
This will change the future for young America.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

271
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:32,095
I don’t know about you…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

272
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:41,889
…but on all these issues, I know we’re
better off because President Obama made the

273
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:46,147
decisions he did.
Now, that brings me to health care.

274
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:54,047
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
And the Republicans call it, derisively, “Obamacare.”

275
00:27:55,098 --> 00:28:01,107
They say it’s a government takeover, a disaster,
and that if we’ll just elect them, they’ll

276
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:06,032
repeal it. Well, are they right?
[AUDIENCE] No!

277
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,090
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Let’s take a look at what’s actually happened

278
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,228
so far.
First, individuals and businesses have already

279
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:21,190
gotten more than a billion dollars in refunds
from insurance companies because the new law

280
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:25,578
requires 80 to 85 percent of your premium
to go to your health care, not profits or

281
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:30,804
promotion.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

282
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:36,306
And the gains are even greater than that because
a bunch of insurance companies have applied

283
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:43,999
to lower their rates to comply with the requirement.
Second, more than 3 million young people between

284
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:50,298
19 and 25 are insured for the first time because
their parents’ policies can cover them.

285
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,360
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Third…

286
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:59,095
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Millions of seniors are receiving preventive

287
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:04,184
care, all the way from breast cancer screenings
to tests for heart problems and scores of

288
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:07,173
other things. And younger people are getting
them, too.

289
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:12,582
Fourth, soon the insurance companies — not
the government, the insurance companies — will

290
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:18,302
have millions of new customers, many of them
middle-class people with pre-existing conditions

291
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:24,898
who never could get insurance before.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

292
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:32,159
Now, finally, listen to this. For the last
two years, after going up at three times the

293
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:40,336
rate of inflation for a decade, for the last
two years health care costs have been under

294
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,470
4 percent in both years for the first time
in 50 years.

295
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:53,047
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
So, let me ask you something. Are we better

296
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,754
off because President Obama fought for health
care reform?

297
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,860
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
You bet we are.

298
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:11,086
Now, there were two other attacks on the president
in Tampa I think deserve an answer. First,

299
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:17,010
both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan
attacked the president for allegedly robbing

300
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:21,072
Medicare of $716 billion.
[AUDIENCE BOOS]

301
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:26,095
That’s the same attack they leveled against
the Congress in 2010, and they got a lot of

302
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:32,014
votes on it. But it’s not true.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

303
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:36,872
Look, here’s what really happened. You be
the judge. Here’s what really happened.

304
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:44,169
There were no cuts to benefits at all. None.
What the president did was to save money by

305
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,860
taking the recommendations of a commission
of professionals to cut unwarranted subsidies

306
00:30:54,086 --> 00:31:01,086
to providers and insurance companies that
were not making people healthier and were

307
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:07,191
not necessary to get the providers to provide
the service.

308
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:13,398
And instead of raiding Medicare, he used the
savings to close the donut hole in the Medicare

309
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:19,371
drug program
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

310
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:26,350
and — you all got to listen carefully to
this; this is really important — and to

311
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:33,035
add eight years to the life of the Medicare
trust fund so it is solvent till 2024.

312
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:40,559
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
So, so President Obama and the Democrats didn’t

313
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:52,044
weaken Medicare; they strengthened Medicare.
Now, when Congressman Ryan looked into that

314
00:31:53,549 --> 00:32:00,549
TV camera and attacked President Obama’s
Medicare savings as, quote, the biggest, coldest

315
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:09,085
power play, I didn’t know whether to laugh
or cry…

316
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:15,110
[LAUGHTER]
…because that $716 billion is exactly, to

317
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:23,001
the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings
that he has in his own budget.

318
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:31,427
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
You got to get one thing, it takes some brass

319
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:38,769
to attack a guy for doing what you did.
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

320
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:47,769
So, ok, wait a minute…
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

321
00:32:54,429 --> 00:33:00,570
…now, you’re having a good time, but this
is getting serious, and I want you to listen.

322
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:03,026
[LAUGHTER]
It’s important, because a lot of people

323
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:08,638
believe this stuff.
Now, at least on this issue, on this one issue,

324
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,587
Governor Romney has been consistent.
[LAUGHTER]

325
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:23,109
He attacked President Obama too, but he actually
wants to repeal those savings and give the

326
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:28,827
money back to the insurance company.
[LAUGHTER AND BOOS]

327
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:33,253
He wants to go back to the old system, which
means we’ll reopen the donut hole and force

328
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:41,009
seniors to pay more for drugs, and we’ll
reduce the life of the Medicare trust fund

329
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:44,046
by eight full years.
[BOOS]

330
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:50,895
So if he’s elected, and if he does what
he promised to do, Medicare will now grow

331
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:54,317
[sic] broke in 2016.
[BOOS]

332
00:33:54,389 --> 00:34:00,600
Think about that. That means, after all, we
won’t have to wait until their voucher program

333
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:02,465
kicks in in 2023…
[LAUGHTER]

334
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,143
…to see the end of Medicare as we know it.
[APPLAUSE]

335
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,410
They’re going to do it to us sooner than
we thought.

336
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:16,077
[APPLAUSE]
Now, folks, this is serious, because it gets

337
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:20,136
worse.
[LAUGHTER]

338
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:25,038
And you won’t be laughing when I finish
telling you this. They also want to block

339
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:29,135
grant Medicaid, and cut it by a third over
the coming 10 years.

340
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,052
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] No!
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Of course, that’s going

341
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:38,151
to really hurt a lot of poor kids. But that’s
not all. Lot of folks don’t know it, but

342
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:45,052
nearly two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on
nursing home care for Medicare seniors who

343
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:48,132
are eligible for Medicaid.
[APPLAUSE]

344
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:56,032
It’s going to end Medicare as we know it.
And a lot of that money is also spent to help

345
00:34:58,045 --> 00:35:02,053
people with disabilities…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

346
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:10,025
…including a lot of middle-class families
whose kids have Down’s syndrome or autism

347
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:17,098
or other severe conditions. And honestly,
let’s think about it, if that happens, I

348
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:24,030
don’t know what those families are going
to do.

349
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:29,014
So I know what I’m going to do. I’m going
to do everything I can to see that it doesn’t

350
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:29,137
happen. We can’t let it happen.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

351
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:33,091
We can’t.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

352
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,146
Now….
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

353
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:42,079
…wait a minute. Let’s look…
[AUDIENCE]

354
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:49,079
Four more years! Four more years! Four more
years!

355
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:56,144
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Let’s look at the other big charge the Republicans

356
00:35:57,044 --> 00:36:02,062
made. It’s a real doozy.
[LAUGHTER]

357
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:09,062
They actually have charged and run ads saying
that President Obama wants to weaken the work

358
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:14,104
requirements in the welfare reform bill I
signed that moved millions of people from

359
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:17,059
welfare to work.
[AUDIENCE MEMBER] Liars!

360
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,064
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
Wait, you need to know, here’s what happened.

361
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:26,030
[LAUGHTER]
Nobody ever tells you what really happened.

362
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:33,003
Here’s what happened.
When some Republican governors asked if they

363
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:40,035
could have waivers to try new ways to put
people on welfare back to work, the Obama

364
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:45,054
administration listened because we all know
it’s hard for even people with good work

365
00:36:45,054 --> 00:36:51,152
histories to get jobs today. So moving folks
from welfare to work is a real challenge.

366
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:59,052
And the administration agreed to give waivers
to those governors and others only if they

367
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:05,014
had a credible plan to increase employment
by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers

368
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:10,133
only if they did increase employment. Now,
did, did I make myself clear? The requirement

369
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:18,033
was for more work, not less.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

370
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:25,058
So, this is personal to me. We moved millions
of people off welfare. It was one of the reasons

371
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,149
in, that in the eight years I was president,
we had a hundred times as many people move

372
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:35,054
out of poverty into the middle class than
happened under the previous 12 years, a hundred

373
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:36,137
times as many.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

374
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:42,076
It’s a big deal. But I am telling you the
claim that President Obama weakened welfare

375
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:47,132
reform’s work requirement is just not true.
[APPLAUSE]

376
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:55,032
But they keep on running the ads claiming
it. You want to know why? Their campaign pollster

377
00:37:56,052 --> 00:38:01,058
said, we are not going to let our campaign
be dictated by fact-checkers.

378
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:08,058
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Now, finally I can say, that is true.

379
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:24,062
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I, I couldn’t have said it better myself.

380
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,022
[LAUGHTER]
And I hope you and every American within the

381
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:36,082
sound of my voice remembers it every time
they see one of those ads, and it turns into

382
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:41,123
an ad to re-elect Barack Obama and keep the
fundamental principles of personal empowerment

383
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:46,031
and moving everybody who can get a job into
work as soon as we can.

384
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:53,031
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Now, let’s talk about the debt. Today, interest

385
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:01,132
rates are low, lower than the rate of inflation.
People are practically paying us to borrow

386
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:06,036
money, to hold their money for them.
But it will become a big problem when the

387
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:11,094
economy grows and interest rates start to
rise. We’ve got to deal with this big long-

388
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:16,136
term debt problem or it will deal with us.
It will gobble up a bigger and bigger percentage

389
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:21,073
of the federal budget we’d rather spend
on education and health care and science and

390
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:23,140
technology. It…we’ve got to deal with
it.

391
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:31,004
Now, what has the president done? He has offered
a reasonable plan of $4 trillion in debt reduction

392
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:39,086
over a decade, with 2 1/2 trillion coming
from…for every $2 1/2 trillion in spending

393
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:47,092
cuts, he raises a dollar in new revenues,
2 1/2-to-1. And he has tight controls on future

394
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:52,184
spending. That’s the kind of balanced approach
proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Commission,

395
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:57,167
a bipartisan commission.
Now, I think this plan is way better than

396
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:05,067
Governor Romney’s plan. First, the Romney
plan failed the first test of fiscal responsibility.

397
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:12,030
The numbers just don’t add up.
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERS]

398
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:17,006
I mean, consider this. What would you do if
you had this problem? Somebody says, oh, we’ve

399
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:20,074
got a big debt problem. We’ve got to reduce
the debt. So what’s the first thing you

400
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:24,107
say we’re going to do? Well, to reduce the
debt, we’re going to have another $5 trillion

401
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:30,080
in tax cuts heavily weighted to upper-income
people. So we’ll make the debt hole bigger

402
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:37,008
before we start to get out of it.
Now, when you say, what are you going to do

403
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:44,057
about this $5 trillion you just added on?
They say, oh, we’ll make it up by eliminating

404
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:50,104
loopholes in the tax code.
So then you ask, well, which loopholes, and

405
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:54,067
how much?
You know what they say? See me about that

406
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,111
after the election.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

407
00:40:57,011 --> 00:41:04,011
I’m not making it up. That’s their position.
See me about that after the election.

408
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:10,061
Now, people ask me all the time how we got
four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas

409
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:14,109
did we bring to Washington? I always give
a one-word answer: Arithmetic.

410
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:22,009
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
If, arithmetic! If…

411
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:29,012
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…if they stay with their $5 trillion tax

412
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:39,011
cut plan — in a debt reduction plan? — the
arithmetic tells us, no matter what they say,

413
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:48,063
one of three things is about to happen. One,
assuming they try to do what they say they’ll

414
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:54,166
do, get rid of, pay, cover it by deductions,
cutting those deductions, one, they’ll have

415
00:41:55,066 --> 00:42:01,084
to eliminate so many deductions, like the
ones for home mortgages and charitable giving,

416
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:07,179
that middle-class families will see their
tax bills go up an average of $2,000 while

417
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,177
anybody who makes $3 million or more will
see their tax bill go down $250,000.

418
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:21,077
[BOOS]
Or, two, they’ll have to cut so much spending

419
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:27,144
that they’ll obliterate the budget for the
national parks, for ensuring clean air, clean

420
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:33,068
water, safe food, safe air travel. They’ll
cut way back on Pell Grants, college loans,

421
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:38,126
early childhood education, child nutrition
programs, all the programs that help to empower

422
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:45,055
middle-class families and help poor kids.
Oh, they’ll cut back on investments in roads

423
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:48,109
and bridges and science and technology and
biomedical research.

424
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:53,016
That’s what they’ll do.
They’ll hurt the middle class and the poor

425
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:59,144
and put the future on hold to give tax cuts
to upper-income people who’ve been getting

426
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:06,065
it all along.
Or three, in spite of all the rhetoric, they’ll

427
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:09,069
just do what they’ve been doing for more
than 30 years. They’ll go in and cut the

428
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:16,066
taxes way more than they cut spending, especially
with that big defense increase, and they’ll

429
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:21,143
just explode the debt and weaken the economy.
And they’ll destroy the federal government’s

430
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:27,106
ability to help you by letting interest gobble
up all your tax payments.

431
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:35,006
Don’t you ever forget when you hear them
talking about this that Republican economic

432
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:43,002
policies quadrupled the national debt before
I took office, in the 12 years before I took

433
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:47,099
office…
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

434
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:54,099
…and doubled the debt in the eight years
after I left, because it defied arithmetic.

435
00:43:56,084 --> 00:44:02,180
[LAUGHTER]
It was a highly inconvenient thing for them

436
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:07,099
in our debates that I was just a country boy
from Arkansas, and I came from a place where

437
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:14,079
people still thought two and two was four.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

438
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:22,051
It’s arithmetic.
We simply cannot afford to give the reins

439
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:26,131
of government to someone who will double down
on trickle down.

440
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:34,031
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Really. Think about this: President Obama…

441
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:41,127
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
…President Obama’s plan cuts the debt,

442
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:46,113
honors our values, brightens the future of
our children, our families and our nation.

443
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:54,013
It’s a heck of a lot better.
It passes the arithmetic test, and far more

444
00:44:54,035 --> 00:45:00,042
important, it passes the values test.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

445
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:07,042
My fellow Americans, all of us in this grand
hall and everybody watching at home, when

446
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:15,055
we vote in this election, we’ll be deciding
what kind of country we want to live in. If

447
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:22,055
you want a winner-take-all, you’re-on-your-own
society, you should support the Republican

448
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:28,101
ticket. But if you want a country of shared
opportunities and shared responsibility, a

449
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:33,076
we’re-all-in-this-together society, you
should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

450
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:38,158
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
If you, if you want…

451
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:44,074
[AUDIENCE MEMBERS] Four more years! Four more
years!

452
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:49,081
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]
If you want America — if you want every

453
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:56,081
American to vote and you think it is wrong
to change voting procedures…

454
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:05,035
[JEERS]
…just to reduce the turnout of younger,

455
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:13,022
poorer, minority and disabled voters you should
support Barack Obama.

456
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:20,076
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
And if you think, if you think the president

457
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:32,132
was right to open the doors of American opportunity
to all those young immigrants brought here

458
00:46:33,032 --> 00:46:40,032
when they were young so they can serve in
the military or go to college, you must vote

459
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,155
for Barack Obama.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

460
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:49,129
If you want a future of shared prosperity,
where the middle class is growing and poverty

461
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:53,105
is declining, where the American dream is
really alive and well again and where the

462
00:46:54,005 --> 00:47:00,084
United States maintains its leadership as
a force for peace and justice and prosperity

463
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:06,177
in this highly competitive world, you have
to vote for Barack Obama.

464
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:14,077
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Look, I love our country so much. And I know

465
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:25,177
we’re coming back. For more than 200 years,
through every crisis, we’ve always come

466
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:33,077
back. People have predicted our demise ever
since George Washington was criticized for

467
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,085
being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of
wooden false teeth.

468
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:40,146
[LAUGHTER]
And so far, every single person that’s bet

469
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:45,129
against America has lost money because we
always come back.

470
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,073
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
We come through ever fire a little stronger

471
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:57,073
and a little better.
And we do it because in the end we decide

472
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:06,128
to champion the cause for which our founders
pledged their lives, their fortunes, their

473
00:48:07,028 --> 00:48:12,102
sacred honor: the cause of forming a more
[AUDIENCE AND CLINTON TOGETHER] perfect union!

474
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,031
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[PRESIDENT CLINTON]

475
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:23,031
My fellow Americans, if that is what you want,
if that is what you believe, you must vote

476
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,047
and you must re-elect President Barack Obama.
[SUSTAINED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

477
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:27,052
God bless you and God bless America.
