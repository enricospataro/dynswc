1
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,163
I'm going to give you
four specific examples,

2
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:17,053
I'm going to cover at the end

3
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:19,728
about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales,

4
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:22,796
how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,796
to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,915
And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years,

8
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,613
a record label I started
that had a CD called "Sauce."

9
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,874
Before I can do that
I've got to tell you about sliced bread,

10
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,597
and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.

11
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:44,880
Now, before sliced bread
was invented in the 1910s

12
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,851
I wonder what they said?

13
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,971
Like the greatest invention
since the telegraph or something.

14
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:53,263
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
invented sliced bread,

15
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:58,296
and he focused, like most inventors did,
on the patent part and the making part.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,543
And the thing about the invention
of sliced bread is this --

17
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,632
that for the first 15 years
after sliced bread was available

18
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,022
no one bought it; no one knew about it;

19
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,320
it was a complete and total failure.

20
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:15,296
And the reason
is that until Wonder came along

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,062
and figured out how to spread
the idea of sliced bread,

22
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:20,280
no one wanted it.

23
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,296
That the success of sliced bread,

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,966
like the success of almost everything
we've talked about at this conference,

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,630
is not always about what the patent
is like, or what the factory is like --

26
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:35,296
it's about can you get
your idea to spread, or not.

27
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,308
And I think that the way
you're going to get what you want,

28
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,252
or cause the change that you want
to change, to happen,

29
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,744
is to figure out a way
to get your ideas to spread.

30
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:48,016
And it doesn't matter to me
whether you're running a coffee shop

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,330
or you're an intellectual,
or you're in business,

32
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:52,595
or you're flying hot air balloons.

33
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:58,642
I think that all this stuff applies
to everybody regardless of what we do.

34
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:03,856
That what we are living in
is a century of idea diffusion.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,138
That people who can spread ideas,
regardless of what those ideas are, win.

36
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,714
When I talk about it
I usually pick business,

37
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:14,243
because they make the best pictures
that you can put in your presentation,

38
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,933
and because it's the easiest
sort of way to keep score.

39
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,515
But I want you to forgive me
when I use these examples

40
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,140
because I'm talking about anything
that you decide to spend your time to do.

41
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:27,606
At the heart of spreading ideas
is TV and stuff like TV.

42
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:34,766
TV and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way.

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,806
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."

44
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,258
The way the TV-industrial complex works,
is you buy some ads,

45
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:42,845
interrupt some people,
that gets you distribution.

46
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:46,591
You use the distribution you get
to sell more products.

47
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:50,734
You take the profit
from that to buy more ads.

48
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,734
And it goes around and around and around,

49
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:56,235
the same way that the military-industrial
complex worked a long time ago.

50
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,306
That model of,
and we heard it yesterday --

51
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,623
if we could only get
onto the homepage of Google,

52
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,186
if we could only figure out
how to get promoted there,

53
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,924
or grab that person by the throat,

54
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:07,713
and tell them about what we want to do.

55
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:11,296
If we did that then everyone would pay
attention, and we would win.

56
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:17,095
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed
my entire childhood and probably yours.

57
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:21,888
I mean, all of these products succeeded
because someone figured out

58
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,976
how to touch people in a way
they weren't expecting,

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,340
in a way they didn't
necessarily want, with an ad,

60
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,593
over and over again until they bought it.

61
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:33,551
And the thing that's happened is,
they canceled the TV-industrial complex.

62
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,424
That just over the last few years,

63
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,272
what anybody who markets
anything has discovered

64
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,716
is that it's not working
the way that it used to.

65
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,329
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize;
I had a bad cold when I took it.

66
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,908
(Laughter)

67
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:50,427
But the product in the blue box
in the center is my poster child.

68
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,419
I go to the deli; I'm sick;
I need to buy some medicine.

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,177
The brand manager for that blue product
spent 100 million dollars

70
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,884
trying to interrupt me in one year.

71
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:02,174
100 million dollars interrupting me
with TV commercials

72
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,066
and magazine ads and Spam

73
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,890
and coupons and shelving
allowances and spiff --

74
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,296
all so I could ignore
every single message.

75
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,867
And I ignored every message

76
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,009
because I don't have
a pain reliever problem.

77
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,689
I buy the stuff in the yellow box
because I always have.

78
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:20,968
And I'm not going to invest a minute
of my time to solve her problem,

79
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,297
because I don't care.

80
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:28,539
Here's a magazine called "Hydrate."
It's 180 pages about water.

81
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:29,564
(Laughter)

82
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,278
Articles about water, ads about water.

83
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,414
Imagine what the world
was like 40 years ago,

84
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:38,162
with just the Saturday Evening Post
and Time and Newsweek.

85
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:39,950
Now there are magazines about water.

86
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,698
New product from Coke Japan: water salad.

87
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,181
(Laughter)

88
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:48,839
Coke Japan comes out
with a new product every three weeks,

89
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:52,379
because they have no idea
what's going to work and what's not.

90
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,488
I couldn't have written
this better myself.

91
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,030
It came out four days ago --

92
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,626
I circled the important parts
so you can see them here.

93
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,085
They've come out...

94
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:05,650
Arby's is going to spend
85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt

95
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,999
with the voice of Tom Arnold,

96
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:12,871
hoping that that will get people to go
to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.

97
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,901
(Laughter)

98
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:19,449
Now, I had tried to imagine what could
possibly be in an animated TV commercial

99
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:22,981
featuring Tom Arnold,
that would get you to get in your car,

100
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:26,195
drive across town
and buy a roast beef sandwich.

101
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:27,592
(Laughter)

102
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:30,996
Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right,

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,757
when he was talking to anyone
who needs to hear your idea.

104
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,433
"The world revolves around me."

105
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,057
Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.

106
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,758
I don't want to get email
from anybody; I want to get "memail."

107
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:43,296
(Laughter)

108
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,970
So consumers, and I don't just mean
people who buy stuff at the Safeway;

109
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:52,106
I mean people at the Defense Department
who might buy something,

110
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,352
or people at, you know, the New Yorker
who might print your article.

111
00:05:55,376 --> 00:06:00,171
Consumers don't care about you
at all; they just don't care.

112
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:03,988
Part of the reason is -- they've got
way more choices than they used to,

113
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,837
and way less time.

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,129
And in a world where we have
too many choices and too little time,

115
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,537
the obvious thing to do
is just ignore stuff.

116
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,243
And my parable here
is you're driving down the road

117
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:22,116
and you see a cow, and you keep driving
because you've seen cows before.

118
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,974
Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.

119
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:28,400
Who's going to stop and pull over
and say -- "Oh, look, a cow."

120
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,575
Nobody.

121
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,296
(Laughter)

122
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,964
But if the cow was purple --
isn't that a great special effect?

123
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,647
I could do that again if you want.

124
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:41,296
If the cow was purple,
you'd notice it for a while.

125
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,368
I mean, if all cows were purple
you'd get bored with those, too.

126
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:48,188
The thing that's going to decide
what gets talked about,

127
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,915
what gets done, what gets changed,

128
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,373
what gets purchased, what gets built,

129
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,687
is: "Is it remarkable?"

130
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,659
And "remarkable" is a really cool word,

131
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,728
because we think it just means "neat,"

132
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,088
but it also means
"worth making a remark about."

133
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:07,407
And that is the essence
of where idea diffusion is going.

134
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,893
That two of the hottest cars
in the United States

135
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,074
is a 55,000-dollar giant car,

136
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:17,209
big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.

137
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,326
People are paying full price for both,

138
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,139
and the only thing they have in common

139
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:25,099
is that they don't have
anything in common.

140
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,297
(Laughter)

141
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:31,443
Every week, the number one
best-selling DVD in America changes.

142
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,847
It's never "The Godfather,"
it's never "Citizen Kane,"

143
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,711
it's always some third-rate movie
with some second-rate star.

144
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:43,296
But the reason it's number one
is because that's the week it came out.

145
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,296
Because it's new, because it's fresh.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,800
People saw it and said
"I didn't know that was there"

147
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,071
and they noticed it.

148
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,248
Two of the big success stories
of the last 20 years in retail --

149
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,234
one sells things that are
super-expensive in a blue box,

150
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,295
and one sells things that are
as cheap as they can make them.

151
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,600
The only thing they have in common
is that they're different.

152
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:04,956
We're now in the fashion business,
no matter what we do for a living,

153
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,510
we're in the fashion business.

154
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:08,296
And people in the fashion business

155
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,723
know what it's like to be in the fashion
business -- they're used to it.

156
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:14,374
The rest of us have to figure out
how to think that way.

157
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:15,620
How to understand

158
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,927
that it's not about interrupting
people with big full-page ads,

159
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,529
or insisting on meetings with people.

160
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:24,369
But it's a totally different
sort of process

161
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:27,296
that determines which ideas spread,
and which ones don't.

162
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,266
They sold a billion dollars'
worth of Aeron chairs

163
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,656
by reinventing
what it meant to sell a chair.

164
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,901
They turned a chair from something
the purchasing department bought,

165
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,162
to something that was a status symbol
about where you sat at work.

166
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:45,741
This guy, Lionel Poilâne,
the most famous baker in the world --

167
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,852
he died two and a half months ago,

168
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,924
and he was a hero of mine
and a dear friend.

169
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:51,138
He lived in Paris.

170
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:55,065
Last year, he sold 10 million dollars'
worth of French bread.

171
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:57,896
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,

172
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,730
by one baker at a time,
in a wood-fired oven.

173
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,818
And when Lionel started his bakery,
the French pooh-pooh-ed it.

174
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,502
They didn't want to buy his bread.

175
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,267
It didn't look like "French bread."

176
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,672
It wasn't what they expected.

177
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,566
It was neat; it was remarkable;

178
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,903
and slowly, it spread
from one person to another person

179
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:20,193
until finally, it became the official
bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.

180
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:23,217
Now he's in London, and he ships
by FedEx all around the world.

181
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:28,581
What marketers used to do is make
average products for average people.

182
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,747
That's what mass marketing is.

183
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,899
Smooth out the edges; go for the center;
that's the big market.

184
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:39,296
They would ignore the geeks,
and God forbid, the laggards.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,296
It was all about going for the center.

186
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,987
But in a world where
the TV-industrial complex is broken,

187
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,631
I don't think that's a strategy
we want to use any more.

188
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:51,429
I think the strategy we want to use
is to not market to these people

189
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:53,739
because they're really good
at ignoring you.

190
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,517
But market to these
people because they care.

191
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,985
These are the people
who are obsessed with something.

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,540
And when you talk to them, they'll listen,

193
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:06,183
because they like listening --
it's about them.

194
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,162
And if you're lucky, they'll tell
their friends on the rest of the curve,

195
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:11,373
and it'll spread.

196
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,176
It'll spread to the entire curve.

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,839
They have something I call "otaku" --
it's a great Japanese word.

198
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,861
It describes the desire
of someone who's obsessed to say,

199
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,718
drive across Tokyo to try
a new ramen noodle place,

200
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,314
because that's what they do:
they get obsessed with it.

201
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,057
To make a product, to market an idea,

202
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,177
to come up with any problem
you want to solve

203
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:33,510
that doesn't have
a constituency with an otaku,

204
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:34,756
is almost impossible.

205
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:38,763
Instead, you have to find
a group that really, desperately cares

206
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,430
about what it is you have to say.

207
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:43,537
Talk to them and make it easy
for them to tell their friends.

208
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,005
There's a hot sauce otaku,
but there's no mustard otaku.

209
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:50,378
That's why there's lots and lots
of kinds of hot sauces,

210
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,989
and not so many kinds of mustard.

211
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,496
Not because it's hard
to make interesting mustard --

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,311
you could make interesting mustard --

213
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:58,810
but people don't,
because no one's obsessed with it,

214
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,615
and thus no one tells their friends.

215
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,018
Krispy Kreme has figured
this whole thing out.

216
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,922
It has a strategy, and what they do is,

217
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,753
they enter a city, they talk
to the people, with the otaku,

218
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,699
and then they spread through the city

219
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,819
to the people who've just
crossed the street.

220
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:16,277
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars,
but it sleeps for 12 minutes.

221
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,338
Not everybody wants it
but they don't care.

222
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:21,889
They want to talk to the people
who do, and maybe it'll spread.

223
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:25,296
These guys make the loudest
car stereo in the world.

224
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,296
(Laughter)

225
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,464
It's as loud as a 747 jet.

226
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,439
You can't get in,
the car's got bulletproof glass,

227
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,702
because it'll blow out
the windshield otherwise.

228
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:36,029
But the fact remains

229
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:39,187
that when someone wants to put
a couple of speakers in their car,

230
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,211
if they've got the otaku
or they've heard from someone who does,

231
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,892
they go ahead and they pick this.

232
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,907
It's really simple -- you sell
to the people who are listening,

233
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,253
and just maybe,
those people tell their friends.

234
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:52,534
So when Steve Jobs talks
to 50,000 people at his keynote,

235
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,178
who are all tuned in from 130 countries

236
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,296
watching his two-hour commercial --

237
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,940
that's the only thing keeping
his company in business --

238
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,613
it's that those 50,000 people
care desperately enough

239
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:05,447
to watch a two-hour commercial,
and then tell their friends.

240
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,152
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released
in the last two years.

241
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:10,533
Every one made a profit. How?

242
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,344
They only sell them on their website.

243
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:14,470
Those people who buy them have the otaku,

244
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:17,547
and then they tell their friends,
and it spreads and it spreads.

245
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,529
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars,
10 times the standard.

246
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:24,576
But hospitals are buying it
faster than any other model.

247
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,296
Hard Candy nail polish,
doesn't appeal to everybody,

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,799
but to the people who love it,
they talk about it like crazy.

249
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:36,466
This paint can right here saved
the Dutch Boy paint company,

250
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,779
making them a fortune.

251
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:39,850
It costs 35 percent more
than regular paint

252
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:43,915
because Dutch Boy made a can that people
talk about, because it's remarkable.

253
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,082
They didn't just slap
a new ad on the product;

254
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,599
they changed what it meant
to build a paint product.

255
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:53,296
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday
250,000 people go to this site,

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,296
run by two volunteers, and I can
tell you they are hard graders --

257
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,130
(Laughter)

258
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:04,202
They didn't get this way
by advertising a lot.

259
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,990
They got this way by being remarkable,

260
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,779
sometimes a little too remarkable.

261
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:13,102
And this picture frame
has a cord going out the back,

262
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,775
and you plug it into the wall.

263
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,648
My father has this on his desk,

264
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:21,108
and he sees his grandchildren
everyday, changing constantly.

265
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,679
And every single person
who walks into his office

266
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,632
hears the whole story
of how this thing ended up on his desk.

267
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,296
And one person at a time,
the idea spreads.

268
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,099
These are not diamonds, not really.

269
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,296
They're made from "cremains."

270
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,457
After you're cremated you can
have yourself made into a gem.

271
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,528
(Laughter)

272
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,838
Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.

273
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,551
(Laughter)

274
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,559
Fastest-growing business
in the whole mortuary industry.

275
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,089
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne --

276
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:54,399
you don't have to be
super-outrageous to do this.

277
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,637
What you have to do

278
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,428
is figure out what people
really want and give it to them.

279
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:00,119
A couple of quick rules to wrap up.

280
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:03,862
The first one is: Design
is free when you get to scale.

281
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,274
The people who come up
with stuff that's remarkable

282
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:09,488
more often than not figure out
how to put design to work for them.

283
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:14,368
Number two: The riskiest thing
you can do now is be safe.

284
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,296
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?

285
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,368
The whole model of being
Proctor and Gamble

286
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,823
is always about average products
for average people.

287
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:22,013
That's risky.

288
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,195
The safe thing to do now
is to be at the fringes,

289
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:26,382
be remarkable.

290
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,364
And being very good is one
of the worst things you can possibly do.

291
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,803
Very good is boring. Very good is average.

292
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,406
It doesn't matter whether
you're making a record album,

293
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,127
or you're an architect,
or you have a tract on sociology.

294
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:43,019
If it's very good, it's not going to work,
because no one's going to notice it.

295
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,419
So my three stories.

296
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:48,935
Silk put a product that does not need
to be in the refrigerated section

297
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,276
next to the milk
in the refrigerated section.

298
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,086
Sales tripled. Why?

299
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,649
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.

300
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:59,550
For the people who were there
and looking at that section,

301
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:00,780
it was remarkable.

302
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:03,043
They didn't triple their sales
with advertising;

303
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,249
they tripled it by doing
something remarkable.

304
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:07,033
That is a remarkable piece of art.

305
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:08,327
You don't have to like it,

306
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:12,915
but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes
in the middle of New York City

307
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,090
is remarkable.

308
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,185
(Laughter)

309
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,127
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum;

310
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,037
he changed an entire city's economy

311
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,619
by designing one building that people
from all over the world went to see.

312
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,548
Now, at countless meetings at, you know,

313
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:29,296
the Portland City Council,
or who knows where,

314
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,581
they said, we need an architect --
can we get Frank Gehry?

315
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:35,296
Because he did something
that was at the fringes.

316
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,563
And my big failure?
I came out with an entire --

317
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:40,296
(Music)

318
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,087
A record album and hopefully
a whole bunch of record albums

319
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,756
in SACD, this remarkable new format --

320
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,081
and I marketed it straight to people
with 20,000-dollar stereos.

321
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:54,201
People with 20,000-dollar stereos
don't like new music.

322
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:58,684
(Laughter)

323
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,409
So what you need to do
is figure out who does care.

324
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,948
Who is going to raise their hand and say,

325
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,901
"I want to hear what you're doing next,"

326
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,352
and sell something to them.

327
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,500
The last example I want to give you.

328
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,729
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.

329
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:17,296
As you can see, if that's nowhere,
it's in the middle of it.

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,839
(Laughter)

331
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:25,248
But they do have a lake.

332
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:28,178
And people used to come from miles
around to swim in the lake.

333
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:29,367
They don't anymore.

334
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:32,274
So the founding fathers said,
"We've got some money to spend.

335
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,749
What can we build here?"

336
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,267
And like most committees,

337
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,483
they were going to build
something pretty safe.

338
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:40,841
And then an artist came to them --
this is a true artist's rendering --

339
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:46,442
he wants to build a 55-foot tall
lava lamp in the center of town.

340
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,744
That's a purple cow;
that's something worth noticing.

341
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:50,927
I don't know about you,

342
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,332
but if they build it,
that's where I'm going to go.

343
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:55,356
Thank you very much for your attention.
