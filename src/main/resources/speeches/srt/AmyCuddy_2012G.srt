1
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:17,925
So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,

2
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,546
and all it requires of you is this:

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,733
that you change your posture
for two minutes.

4
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:28,157
But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now

5
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:31,750
do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.

6
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:34,465
So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?

7
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,810
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.

8
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:41,549
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.

9
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:45,220
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)

10
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:47,492
I see you. (Laughter)

11
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:50,507
So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.

12
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,865
We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,

13
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,813
and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,

14
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:59,249
it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.

15
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:03,773
So, we're really fascinated
with body language,

16
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,696
and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,917
You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —

18
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:16,315
an awkward interaction, or a smile,

19
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:20,547
or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,

20
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:23,785
or maybe even something like a handshake.

21
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:27,134
Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.

22
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:31,627
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.

23
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,554
Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)

24
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,229
(Laughter) (Applause)

25
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:42,936
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,460
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.

27
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:47,600
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

28
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:51,551
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,

29
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,939
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --

30
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:57,819
it's language, so we think
about communication.

31
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:00,846
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,285
So what is your body language
communicating to me?

33
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,351
What's mine communicating to you?

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:11,323
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.

35
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,591
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time

36
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,696
looking at the effects
of our body language,

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,005
or other people's body language,
on judgments.

38
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,444
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.

39
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:25,434
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes

40
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:29,227
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.

41
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:33,912
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,

42
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:38,384
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips

43
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,408
of real physician-patient interactions,

44
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,241
their judgments
of the physician's niceness

45
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,878
predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.

46
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,560
So it doesn't have to do so much

47
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,083
with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,

48
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,913
but do we like that person
and how they interacted?

49
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:56,848
Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton

50
00:02:56,872 --> 00:03:00,525
has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces

51
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,493
in just one second predict 70 percent

52
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,343
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,

53
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,565
and even, let's go digital,

54
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:14,710
emoticons used well in online negotiations

55
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,542
can lead to you claim more value
from that negotiation.

56
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,765
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

57
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:23,862
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,

58
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:26,764
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.

59
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,884
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience

60
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,319
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.

61
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,532
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

62
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:37,895
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.

63
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,958
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

64
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:43,901
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,

65
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,628
and I teach at a competitive
business school,

66
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:51,112
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.

67
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:54,924
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,927
of power and dominance.

69
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,666
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?

70
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,749
Well, this is what they are.

71
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:04,627
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.

72
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:07,637
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

73
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,578
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.

74
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,524
It's about opening up.

75
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,279
And this is true
across the animal kingdom.

76
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,328
It's not just limited to primates.

77
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:20,748
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)

78
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:24,459
So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,

79
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:27,460
and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.

80
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,532
And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us

81
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:34,554
how universal and old these
expressions of power are.

82
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,153
This expression, which is known as pride,

83
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,406
Jessica Tracy has studied.

84
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,313
She shows that people
who are born with sight

85
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:45,254
and people who are congenitally
blind do this

86
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,568
when they win at a physical competition.

87
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:50,046
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,547
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.

89
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,864
They do this.

90
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,386
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.

91
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,473
What do we do when we feel powerless?

92
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,252
We do exactly the opposite.

93
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:02,780
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.

94
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,148
We make ourselves small.

95
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:06,528
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.

96
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:09,285
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.

97
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,265
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.

98
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,391
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power

99
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,044
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.

100
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,475
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,

101
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,119
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.

102
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:25,733
We do the opposite of them.

103
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:28,932
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,

104
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,469
and what do I notice?

105
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:38,722
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.

106
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,270
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,

107
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:44,675
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room

108
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,112
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.

109
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:50,375
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.

110
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,133
They raise their hands like this.

111
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,768
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing

112
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,292
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.

113
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,585
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,

114
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,403
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,

115
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:04,765
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.

116
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,647
I notice a couple of things about this.

117
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:08,481
One, you're not going to be surprised.

118
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,523
It seems to be related to gender.

119
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:15,988
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.

120
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,574
Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,

121
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,456
so this is not surprising.

122
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,529
But the other thing I noticed

123
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:25,195
is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent

124
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,055
to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.

125
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,637
And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,

126
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:34,318
because participation
counts for half the grade.

127
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:38,791
So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.

128
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,063
You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in

129
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:44,230
and then you get
these differences in grades,

130
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,319
and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.

131
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:50,342
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,

132
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,984
so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.

133
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,537
Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it

134
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,561
and would it lead them
to participate more?

135
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,174
So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,

136
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:06,729
and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?

137
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,280
Like, can you do this
just for a little while

138
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,956
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome

139
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,682
that makes you seem more powerful?

140
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:17,134
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people

141
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,539
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.

142
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:20,985
But our question really was,

143
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,049
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?

144
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,739
There's some evidence that they do.

145
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:32,375
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,

146
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,553
but also, when we're forced to smile

147
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:38,968
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.

148
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,910
So it goes both ways.

149
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:44,716
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.

150
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,264
So when you feel powerful,

151
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,059
you're more likely to do this,

152
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:55,261
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,

153
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,684
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.

154
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,744
So the second question
really was, you know,

155
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,327
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,

156
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,744
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?

157
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,471
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,

158
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,843
what am I talking about?

159
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,009
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

160
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:18,605
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,

161
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,672
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.

162
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:26,006
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?

163
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,302
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,

164
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:34,526
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.

165
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,836
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.

166
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,704
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.

167
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,348
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.

168
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:47,611
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.

169
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,455
Physiologically,
there also are differences

170
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:54,520
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,

171
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:58,214
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

172
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:05,359
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies

173
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:08,557
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

174
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,489
and powerful and effective leaders

175
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,338
also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.

176
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,743
So what does that mean?
When you think about power,

177
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,066
people tended to think
only about testosterone,

178
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,854
because that was about dominance.

179
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:24,324
But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.

180
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:27,453
So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,

181
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:30,195
high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?

182
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,760
Probably not, right?

183
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,814
You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,

184
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:38,502
but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.

185
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:43,652
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

186
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:46,744
if an alpha needs to take over,

187
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:50,982
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,

188
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:54,093
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up

189
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:57,598
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.

190
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,639
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape

191
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:03,005
the mind, at least at the facial level,

192
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,134
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.

193
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,916
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,

194
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,500
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,

195
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:14,953
like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?

196
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:17,787
"For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,

197
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,347
and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."

198
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,301
So this is what we did.

199
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:27,916
We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,

200
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,465
and these people adopted, for two minutes,

201
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,949
either high-power poses
or low-power poses,

202
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,290
and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,

203
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:38,875
although they took on only two.

204
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,379
So here's one.

205
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,918
A couple more.

206
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:48,365
This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.

207
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,764
Here are a couple more.

208
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:52,118
So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.

209
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,103
And here are the low-power poses.

210
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,857
So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.

211
00:10:58,464 --> 00:10:59,905
This one is very low-power.

212
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:03,888
When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.

213
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,909
So this is what happens.

214
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:08,233
They come in, they spit into a vial,

215
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:11,406
for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."

216
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,471
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

217
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:16,022
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.

218
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,679
We want them to be feeling power.

219
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,038
So two minutes they do this.

220
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:22,247
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,

221
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,614
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,

222
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:27,379
and then we take another saliva sample.

223
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,261
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

224
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,846
So this is what we find.

225
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,750
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

226
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:36,888
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,

227
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,046
86 percent of you will gamble.

228
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,166
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,

229
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,166
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.

230
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,646
Here's what we find on testosterone.

231
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,183
From their baseline when they come in,

232
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:53,513
high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,

233
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:58,134
and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.

234
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,951
So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.

235
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,952
Here's what you get on cortisol.

236
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:06,750
High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,

237
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:10,882
and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.

238
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:13,614
So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes

239
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,258
that configure your brain

240
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:19,559
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,

241
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,636
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.

242
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,423
And we've all had the feeling, right?

243
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:32,631
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,

244
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:35,087
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.

245
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,514
Also, our bodies change our minds.

246
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,920
But the next question, of course,

247
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:41,764
is, can power posing for a few minutes

248
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,825
really change your life
in meaningful ways?

249
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:48,142
This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.

250
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,907
Where can you actually apply this?

251
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,742
Which we cared about, of course.

252
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:58,507
And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,

253
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,984
like social threat situations.

254
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,564
Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?

255
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,645
For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.

256
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,942
For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.

257
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:13,730
It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this

258
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,528
or doing a job interview.

259
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:19,220
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to

260
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:22,139
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.

261
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:24,894
So we published these findings,

262
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,479
and the media are all over it,

263
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,578
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

264
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,675
when you go in
for the job interview, right?

265
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:31,706
(Laughter)

266
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,177
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,

267
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,473
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.

268
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:38,737
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

269
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,328
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.

270
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:42,913
It's you talking to yourself.

271
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,996
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.

272
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,562
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --

273
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,848
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.

274
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,742
You're looking at your notes,

275
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,766
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

276
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,219
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,

277
00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:00,280
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.

278
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,066
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

279
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,884
So we bring people into a lab,

280
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:07,261
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,

281
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,893
they go through
a very stressful job interview.

282
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,509
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.

283
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,490
They're being judged also,

284
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:19,995
and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,

285
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,578
so they look like this.

286
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,886
Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.

287
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,509
So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.

288
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,173
People hate this.

289
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:33,913
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."

290
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,722
So this really spikes your cortisol.

291
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,032
So this is the job interview
we put them through,

292
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:40,253
because we really wanted
to see what happened.

293
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,360
We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.

294
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,532
They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.

295
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:49,317
They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,

296
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:54,407
and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,

297
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,579
and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"

298
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,104
all the high-power posers.

299
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,901
"We don't want to hire these people.

300
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:03,742
We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."

301
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,406
But what's driving it?

302
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,422
It's not about the content of the speech.

303
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,298
It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.

304
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,799
Because we rate them
on all these variables

305
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:16,362
related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?

306
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:18,620
How good is it?
What are their qualifications?

307
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,270
No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.

308
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,993
These kinds of things.

309
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,408
People are bringing
their true selves, basically.

310
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:26,822
They're bringing themselves.

311
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,945
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,

312
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,181
with no, you know, residue over them.

313
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:36,112
So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.

314
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,480
So when I tell people about this,

315
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,859
that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,

316
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,635
and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,

317
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,202
"It feels fake." Right?

318
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,104
So I said, fake it till you make it.

319
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,981
It's not me.

320
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:54,156
I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.

321
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,990
I don't want to feel like an impostor.

322
00:15:56,014 --> 00:16:00,087
I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.

323
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:02,274
And that really resonated with me,

324
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:05,520
because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor

325
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,742
and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.

326
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,683
When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.

327
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:14,088
I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.

328
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,970
I was thrown from the car.

329
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,958
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,

330
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:21,191
and I had been withdrawn from college,

331
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:26,903
and I learned that my I.Q. had dropped
by two standard deviations,

332
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,491
which was very traumatic.

333
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:32,362
I knew my I.Q. because
I had identified with being smart,

334
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,374
and I had been called gifted as a child.

335
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:37,574
So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.

336
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,798
They say, "You're not going
to finish college.

337
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:42,375
Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,

338
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,399
but that's not going to work out for you."

339
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:47,957
So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,

340
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:50,731
having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,

341
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,590
and for me it was being smart,

342
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,253
having that taken from you,

343
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:57,376
there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.

344
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,179
So I felt entirely powerless.

345
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,065
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,

346
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:02,935
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.

347
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,187
Eventually I graduated from college.

348
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,211
It took me four years
longer than my peers,

349
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:11,552
and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,

350
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,496
to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,

351
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,347
and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.

352
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,641
I am an impostor.

353
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,570
And the night before my first-year talk,

354
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:24,093
and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.

355
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:25,295
That's it.

356
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,782
I was so afraid of being
found out the next day

357
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:30,595
that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."

358
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,451
She was like, "You are not quitting,

359
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:35,009
because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.

360
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,800
You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.

361
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,157
You are going to fake it.

362
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,337
You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.

363
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,600
You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,

364
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:47,045
even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed

365
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,418
and having an out-of-body experience,

366
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,788
until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

367
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,754
Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"

368
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:56,873
So that's what I did.

369
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:58,281
Five years in grad school,

370
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,405
a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,

371
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,492
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,

372
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:06,492
I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,

373
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,298
"Not supposed to be here."

374
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,015
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,

375
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,340
a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,

376
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:19,031
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"

377
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:21,579
came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.

378
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:25,031
She came in totally defeated,
and she said,

379
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:28,181
"I'm not supposed to be here."

380
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,888
And that was the moment for me.

381
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,504
Because two things happened.

382
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,798
One was that I realized,

383
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,932
oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.

384
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:42,956
I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.

385
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,251
And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!

386
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,228
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.

387
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,795
So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!

388
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,581
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,

389
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:55,294
you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --

390
00:18:55,318 --> 00:19:00,711
(Applause)

391
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,789
"And you're going to go
into the classroom,

392
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:07,213
and you are going to give
the best comment ever."

393
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:10,218
You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,

394
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,181
And people turned around and were like,

395
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:15,125
oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)

396
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,942
She comes back to me months later,

397
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,006
and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,

398
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,404
she had actually faked it
till she became it.

399
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,227
So she had changed.

400
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:28,311
And so I want to say to you,
don't fake it till you make it.

401
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,108
Fake it till you become it.

402
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,749
Do it enough until you actually
become it and internalize.

403
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,404
The last thing I'm going
to leave you with is this.

404
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:41,876
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

405
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,373
So, this is two minutes.

406
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:46,207
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

407
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:49,355
Before you go into the next stressful
evaluative situation,

408
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:52,061
for two minutes, try doing this,
in the elevator,

409
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:55,300
in a bathroom stall, at your desk
behind closed doors.

410
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,727
That's what you want to do.

411
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:59,562
Configure your brain
to cope the best in that situation.

412
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,527
Get your testosterone up.
Get your cortisol down.

413
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:06,493
Don't leave that situation feeling
like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

414
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,217
Leave that situation feeling like,

415
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,213
I really feel like I got to say
who I am and show who I am.

416
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:17,004
So I want to ask you first, you know,
both to try power posing,

417
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:22,118
and also I want to ask you to share
the science, because this is simple.

418
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,295
I don't have ego involved in this.
(Laughter)

419
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,082
Give it away. Share it with people,

420
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,526
because the people who can use it the most

421
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,901
are the ones with no resources
and no technology

422
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,099
and no status and no power.

423
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,671
Give it to them
because they can do it in private.

424
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,139
They need their bodies,
privacy and two minutes,

425
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:42,289
and it can significantly change
the outcomes of their life.

426
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:43,444
Thank you.

427
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:46,499
(Applause)
