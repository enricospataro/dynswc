1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,498
Good morning. How are you?

2
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:17,732
(Laughter)

3
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,069
It's been great, hasn't it?

4
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:22,549
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

5
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,065
In fact, I'm leaving.

6
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,656
(Laughter)

7
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:33,042
There have been three themes
running through the conference

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,573
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

9
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:40,287
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

10
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,724
in all of the presentations that we've had

11
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,549
and in all of the people here.

12
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,224
Just the variety of it
and the range of it.

13
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:50,121
The second is
that it's put us in a place

14
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:52,642
where we have no idea
what's going to happen,

15
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,057
in terms of the future.

16
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,796
No idea how this may play out.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,712
I have an interest in education.

18
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:02,868
Actually, what I find is everybody
has an interest in education.

19
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:04,030
Don't you?

20
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,535
I find this very interesting.

21
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,316
If you're at a dinner party,

22
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,678
and you say you work in education --

23
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,666
Actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,486
(Laughter)

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,938
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

26
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,053
(Laughter)

27
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:25,796
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

28
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,295
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

29
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,096
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,796
and you say you work in education,

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,896
you can see the blood run from their face.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,200
They're like, "Oh my God,"
you know, "Why me?"

33
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,861
(Laughter)

34
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,508
"My one night out all week."

35
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,142
(Laughter)

36
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,407
But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall.

37
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:48,898
Because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?

38
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:52,355
Like religion, and money and other things.

39
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,731
So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.

40
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,647
We have a huge vested interest in it,

41
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,991
partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future

42
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,534
that we can't grasp.

43
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,192
If you think of it,
children starting school this year

44
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:10,740
will be retiring in 2065.

45
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,663
Nobody has a clue,

46
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:17,131
despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,

47
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,796
what the world will look like
in five years' time.

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,114
And yet we're meant
to be educating them for it.

49
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:24,688
So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.

50
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,079
And the third part of this

51
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,140
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

52
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:33,469
on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --

53
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,827
their capacities for innovation.

54
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,362
I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?

55
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,996
Just seeing what she could do.

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,796
And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,776
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,596
What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication

59
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,887
who found a talent.

60
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,520
And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents.

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,596
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

62
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,796
So I want to talk about education

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,692
and I want to talk about creativity.

64
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:07,735
My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

65
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,623
and we should treat it
with the same status.

66
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,618
(Applause) Thank you.

67
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:16,987
(Applause)

68
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:18,564
That was it, by the way.

69
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:19,591
Thank you very much.

70
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,730
(Laughter)

71
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,431
So, 15 minutes left.

72
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:26,391
(Laughter)

73
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,307
Well, I was born... no.

74
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,363
(Laughter)

75
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,132
I heard a great story recently
-- I love telling it --

76
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,871
of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.

77
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,030
She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,

78
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,854
and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,

79
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,664
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

80
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:45,028
The teacher was fascinated.

81
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,814
She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"

82
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,329
And the girl said, "I'm
drawing a picture of God."

83
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:54,780
And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."

84
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:56,892
And the girl said,
"They will, in a minute."

85
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:03,698
(Laughter)

86
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,749
When my son was four in England --

87
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,424
Actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

88
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,115
(Laughter)

89
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:18,611
If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.

90
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:21,273
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

91
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:22,516
(Laughter)

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,367
No, it was big, it was a big story.

93
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,696
Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,981
(Laughter)

95
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:29,315
"Nativity II."

96
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,474
But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.

97
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,035
We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.

98
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,536
We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:

99
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,796
"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter)

100
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,427
He didn't have to speak,

101
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,889
but you know the bit
where the three kings come in?

102
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,644
They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

103
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:48,782
This really happened.

104
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,896
We were sitting there and I think
they just went out of sequence,

105
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,696
because we talked to the little boy
afterward and we said,

106
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,596
"You OK with that?" And he said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

107
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,696
They just switched.

108
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,896
The three boys came in,

109
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,107
four-year-olds with tea towels
on their heads,

110
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,622
and they put these boxes down,

111
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,695
and the first boy said,
"I bring you gold."

112
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,857
And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."

113
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:09,885
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

114
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,809
(Laughter)

115
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,621
What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.

116
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:28,253
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

117
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:31,814
Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

118
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:36,220
I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.

119
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:39,796
What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

120
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,187
you'll never come up
with anything original --

121
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,296
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

122
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:48,830
And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.

123
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,746
They have become
frightened of being wrong.

124
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,460
And we run our companies like this.

125
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,136
We stigmatize mistakes.

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,462
And we're now running
national education systems

127
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,832
where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,728
And the result is that
we are educating people

129
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:06,043
out of their creative capacities.

130
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:10,545
Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.

131
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,791
The problem is to remain an artist
as we grow up.

132
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,896
I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,776
we grow out of it.

134
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,683
Or rather, we get educated out if it.

135
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,540
So why is this?

136
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:26,727
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.

137
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,004
In fact, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles.

138
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,356
So you can imagine
what a seamless transition that was.

139
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,796
(Laughter)

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,196
Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,

141
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,471
just outside Stratford,

142
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,656
which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.

143
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,277
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

144
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,896
You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?

145
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,796
Do you? Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

146
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,387
Shakespeare being seven?

147
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,660
I never thought of it.

148
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,368
I mean, he was seven at some point.

149
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,702
He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?

150
00:06:55,726 --> 00:07:02,513
(Laughter)

151
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:03,866
How annoying would that be?

152
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,890
(Laughter)

153
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:12,584
"Must try harder."

154
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,508
(Laughter)

155
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:19,996
Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!

156
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,448
And put the pencil down."

157
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:23,546
(Laughter)

158
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,125
"And stop speaking like that."

159
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,040
(Laughter)

160
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,388
"It's confusing everybody."

161
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:35,535
(Laughter)

162
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,897
Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,

163
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,362
and I just want to say a word
about the transition.

164
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:44,796
My son didn't want to come.

165
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,796
I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

166
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,864
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

167
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,844
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

168
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:56,471
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

169
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:57,956
He'd known her for a month.

170
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,330
(Laughter)

171
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,610
Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,

172
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,573
because it's a long time when you're 16.

173
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,258
He was really upset on the plane,

174
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:08,743
he said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."

175
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:11,145
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --

176
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,069
(Laughter)

177
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:22,096
Because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

178
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,120
(Laughter)

179
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,221
But something strikes you
when you move to America

180
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:31,611
and travel around the world:

181
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:35,013
Every education system on Earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.

182
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:37,312
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

183
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,606
You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.

184
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,596
At the top are mathematics and languages,

185
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,054
then the humanities,
and at the bottom are the arts.

186
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,196
Everywhere on Earth.

187
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,315
And in pretty much every system too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

188
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,196
Art and music are normally
given a higher status in schools

189
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,387
than drama and dance.

190
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,667
There isn't an education
system on the planet

191
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,749
that teaches dance everyday to children

192
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,820
the way we teach them mathematics. Why?

193
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:03,045
Why not? I think this is rather important.

194
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,372
I think math is very
important, but so is dance.

195
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:08,296
Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,796
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?

197
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,158
(Laughter)

198
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,665
Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,

199
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,457
we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.

200
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,106
And then we focus on their heads.

201
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,620
And slightly to one side.

202
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,796
If you were to visit
education, as an alien,

203
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,796
and say "What's it for, public education?"

204
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,596
I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,

205
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,996
who really succeeds by this,

206
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,796
who does everything that they should,

207
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,551
who gets all the brownie
points, who are the winners --

208
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:40,914
I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education

209
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,035
throughout the world

210
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,012
is to produce university professors.

211
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,347
Isn't it?

212
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,354
They're the people who come out the top.

213
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,557
And I used to be one, so there.

214
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,217
(Laughter)

215
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:55,342
And I like university
professors, but you know,

216
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:56,841
we shouldn't hold them up

217
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,796
as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.

218
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,796
They're just a form of life,

219
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,380
another form of life.

220
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:06,702
But they're rather curious, and I say this
out of affection for them.

221
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:09,696
There's something curious
about professors in my experience --

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,396
not all of them, but typically,
they live in their heads.

223
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,563
They live up there,
and slightly to one side.

224
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,689
They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.

225
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:21,806
They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.

226
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,996
(Laughter)

227
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,036
Don't they?

228
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,282
It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.

229
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:36,818
(Laughter)

230
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:40,672
If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences,

231
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:44,182
get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics,

232
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:46,449
and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.

233
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,274
(Laughter)

234
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:50,654
And there, you will see it.

235
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:54,796
Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

236
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,687
(Laughter)

237
00:10:57,711 --> 00:11:01,036
Waiting until it ends so they can
go home and write a paper about it.

238
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,964
(Laughter)

239
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:06,831
Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

240
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:08,096
And there's a reason.

241
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,676
Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,

242
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,806
really, before the 19th century.

243
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,787
They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.

244
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,252
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

245
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:23,873
Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.

246
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,928
So you were
probably steered benignly away

247
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,886
from things at school when you
were a kid, things you liked,

248
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,296
on the grounds that you would
never get a job doing that. Is that right?

249
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,701
Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;

250
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,526
don't do art, you won't be an artist.

251
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,970
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

252
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:42,139
The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.

253
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,260
And the second is academic ability,

254
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:47,169
which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,

255
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:50,096
because the universities designed
the system in their image.

256
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,614
If you think of it, the whole system
of public education around the world

257
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,864
is a protracted process
of university entrance.

258
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,221
And the consequence
is that many highly-talented,

259
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,680
brilliant, creative
people think they're not,

260
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,842
because the thing
they were good at at school

261
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,974
wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.

262
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:07,499
And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.

263
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,987
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

264
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,821
more people worldwide will be graduating

265
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,391
through education
than since the beginning of history.

266
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:19,096
More people, and it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about --

267
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,168
technology and its transformation
effect on work, and demography

268
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,996
and the huge explosion in population.

269
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,885
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

270
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,289
Isn't that true?

271
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,296
When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.

272
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,096
If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.

273
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,796
And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)

274
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,894
But now kids with degrees

275
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,963
are often heading home
to carry on playing video games,

276
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:47,185
because you need an MA where
the previous job required a BA,

277
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,996
and now you need a PhD for the other.

278
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,796
It's a process of academic inflation.

279
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,196
And it indicates the whole
structure of education

280
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,653
is shifting beneath our feet.

281
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:57,297
We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.

282
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,316
We know three things about intelligence.

283
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,567
One, it's diverse.

284
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:03,596
We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.

285
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,596
We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.

286
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,921
We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.

287
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,820
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

288
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,796
If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,

289
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,796
as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,

290
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,796
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

291
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,058
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

292
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,796
In fact, creativity --
which I define as the process

293
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,145
of having original ideas
that have value --

294
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:29,821
more often than not comes about
through the interaction

295
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:32,845
of different disciplinary
ways of seeing things.

296
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,796
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain

297
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,311
called the corpus callosum.

298
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,601
It's thicker in women.

299
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:42,649
Following off from Helen yesterday,

300
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,796
this is probably why women
are better at multi-tasking.

301
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,637
Because you are, aren't you?

302
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,868
There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.

303
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:56,796
If my wife is cooking a meal at home --
which is not often, thankfully.

304
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,674
(Laughter)

305
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:02,196
No, she's good at some things,
but if she's cooking,

306
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,096
she's dealing with people on the phone,

307
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,676
she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling,

308
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,796
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

309
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,796
If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,

310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,796
the phone's on the hook,
if she comes in I get annoyed.

311
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,891
I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

312
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:25,645
(Laughter)

313
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,274
"Give me a break."

314
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,018
(Laughter)

315
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,541
Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,

316
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:34,818
if a tree falls in a forest
and nobody hears it, did it happen?

317
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,401
Remember that old chestnut?

318
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,834
I saw a great t-shirt
recently, which said,

319
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:42,796
"If a man speaks his mind
in a forest, and no woman hears him,

320
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,216
is he still wrong?"

321
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,846
(Laughter)

322
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,796
And the third thing about intelligence is,

323
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,189
it's distinct.

324
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,147
I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"

325
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:00,645
which is based on a series
of interviews with people

326
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,589
about how they discovered their talent.

327
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:04,782
I'm fascinated
by how people got to be there.

328
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,996
It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman

329
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,696
who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,350
Have you heard of her? Some have.

331
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,896
She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.

332
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,921
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

333
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:17,923
She's wonderful.

334
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:20,093
I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet,

335
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,318
as you can see.

336
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:23,742
Anyway, Gillian and I had
lunch one day and I said,

337
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,667
"How did you get to be a dancer?"

338
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:26,796
It was interesting.

339
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,170
When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.

340
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,796
And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,

341
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
"We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."

342
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:36,986
She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.

343
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,300
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.
Wouldn't you?

344
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:44,383
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.

345
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,796
It wasn't an available condition.

346
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,557
(Laughter)

347
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,641
People weren't aware they could have that.

348
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:53,799
(Laughter)

349
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:58,101
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

350
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,847
So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,

351
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:04,348
and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,

352
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:08,011
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes
while this man talked to her mother

353
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,363
about the problems
Gillian was having at school.

354
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:14,064
Because she was disturbing people;
her homework was always late; and so on,

355
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,184
little kid of eight.

356
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,263
In the end, the doctor
went and sat next to Gillian, and said,

357
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,992
"I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me,

358
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:22,635
I need to speak to her privately.

359
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,035
Wait here. We'll be back;
we won't be very long,"

360
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,384
and they went and left her.

361
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,044
But as they went out of the room,

362
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,568
he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.

363
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:35,592
And when they got out, he said to her
mother, "Just stand and watch her."

364
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,811
And the minute they left the room,

365
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:41,319
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

366
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,796
And they watched for a few minutes
and he turned to her mother and said,

367
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,796
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian
isn't sick; she's a dancer.

368
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,796
Take her to a dance school."

369
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,796
I said, "What happened?"

370
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,796
She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.

371
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,573
We walked in this room
and it was full of people like me.

372
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,796
People who couldn't sit still.

373
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,407
People who had to move to think."
Who had to move to think.

374
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,196
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.

375
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,040
She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School;

376
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,363
she became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

377
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,995
She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,

378
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,995
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

379
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,263
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

380
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:22,797
She's been responsible for

381
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,967
some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,

382
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:29,064
she's given pleasure to millions,
and she's a multi-millionaire.

383
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,159
Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.

384
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:39,966
(Applause)

385
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:41,996
What I think it comes to is this:

386
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,796
Al Gore spoke the other night

387
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,089
about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

388
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:51,097
I believe our only hope for the future

389
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,954
is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,

390
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:57,796
one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception

391
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,796
of the richness of human capacity.

392
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,319
Our education system has mined our minds

393
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:06,619
in the way that we strip-mine the earth:
for a particular commodity.

394
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,492
And for the future, it won't serve us.

395
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:11,796
We have to rethink
the fundamental principles

396
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,788
on which we're educating our children.

397
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,581
There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,

398
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:21,644
"If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,

399
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,509
within 50 years all life
on Earth would end.

400
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,580
If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,

401
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:31,238
within 50 years all forms
of life would flourish."

402
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,349
And he's right.

403
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,745
What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

404
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:40,308
We have to be careful now

405
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,587
that we use this gift wisely

406
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:45,840
and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.

407
00:18:45,864 --> 00:18:49,796
And the only way we'll do it is by seeing
our creative capacities

408
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,430
for the richness they are

409
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:54,636
and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

410
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,058
And our task is to educate
their whole being,

411
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:58,566
so they can face this future.

412
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,796
By the way -- we may not see this future,

413
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,250
but they will.

414
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,353
And our job is to help them
make something of it.

415
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,377
Thank you very much.

416
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:09,401
(Applause)
