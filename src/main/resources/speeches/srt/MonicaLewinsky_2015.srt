1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:17,557
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.

2
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,357
Obviously, that's changed,

3
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,201
but only recently.

4
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,449
It was several months ago

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,422
that I gave my very first
major public talk

6
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,037
at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:

7
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:34,251
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.

8
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,685
That meant that in 1998,

9
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:41,272
the oldest among the group were only 14,

10
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:44,119
and the youngest, just four.

11
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,448
I joked with them that some
might only have heard of me

12
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,400
from rap songs.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,547
Yes, I'm in rap songs.

14
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:57,244
Almost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)

15
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,929
But the night of my speech,
a surprising thing happened.

16
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:08,175
At the age of 41, I was hit on
by a 27-year-old guy.

17
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:11,151
I know, right?

18
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,734
He was charming and I was flattered,

19
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,507
and I declined.

20
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,151
You know what his
unsuccessful pickup line was?

21
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,281
He could make me feel 22 again.

22
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:29,227
(Laughter) (Applause)

23
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:35,728
I realized later that night,
I'm probably the only person over 40

24
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,329
who does not want to be 22 again.

25
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,929
(Laughter)

26
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,789
(Applause)

27
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:52,114
At the age of 22,
I fell in love with my boss,

28
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:54,935
and at the age of 24,

29
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:58,367
I learned the devastating consequences.

30
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:02,668
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here

31
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:07,181
who didn't make a mistake
or do something they regretted at 22?

32
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,538
Yep. That's what I thought.

33
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:18,248
So like me, at 22, a few of you
may have also taken wrong turns

34
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:21,286
and fallen in love with the wrong person,

35
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,248
maybe even your boss.

36
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,793
Unlike me, though, your boss

37
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:30,872
probably wasn't the president
of the United States of America.

38
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:35,918
Of course, life is full of surprises.

39
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:40,841
Not a day goes by that I'm not
reminded of my mistake,

40
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,114
and I regret that mistake deeply.

41
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:51,846
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,

42
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:57,308
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom

43
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:01,355
like we had never seen before.

44
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,697
Remember, just a few years earlier,

45
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,699
news was consumed from just three places:

46
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,371
reading a newspaper or magazine,

47
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,206
listening to the radio,

48
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:12,824
or watching television.

49
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,124
That was it.

50
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:18,079
But that wasn't my fate.

51
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,701
Instead, this scandal was brought to you

52
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,101
by the digital revolution.

53
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,808
That meant we could access
all the information we wanted,

54
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:32,103
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,

55
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:36,793
and when the story broke in January 1998,

56
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:39,579
it broke online.

57
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,580
It was the first time the traditional news

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,103
was usurped by the Internet
for a major news story,

59
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:51,324
a click that reverberated
around the world.

60
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:54,742
What that meant for me personally

61
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:59,860
was that overnight I went
from being a completely private figure

62
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,307
to a publicly humiliated one worldwide.

63
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:09,602
I was patient zero
of losing a personal reputation

64
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:14,158
on a global scale almost instantaneously.

65
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,747
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,

66
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:21,862
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

67
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,921
Granted, it was before social media,

68
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:28,473
but people could still comment online,

69
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:34,701
email stories, and, of course,
email cruel jokes.

70
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,790
News sources plastered
photos of me all over

71
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,574
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

72
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,113
and to keep people tuned to the TV.

73
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,282
Do you recall a particular image of me,

74
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:51,744
say, wearing a beret?

75
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,039
Now, I admit I made mistakes,

76
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,907
especially wearing that beret.

77
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:04,376
But the attention and judgment
that I received, not the story,

78
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:08,740
but that I personally received,
was unprecedented.

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,899
I was branded as a tramp,

80
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:18,447
tart, slut, whore, bimbo,

81
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,225
and, of course, that woman.

82
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:25,040
I was seen by many

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,428
but actually known by few.

84
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,006
And I get it: it was easy to forget

85
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,607
that that woman was dimensional,

86
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:38,575
had a soul, and was once unbroken.

87
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:46,224
When this happened to me 17 years ago,
there was no name for it.

88
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:50,621
Now we call it cyberbullying
and online harassment.

89
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,737
Today, I want to share
some of my experience with you,

90
00:05:55,737 --> 00:06:00,171
talk about how that experience has helped
shape my cultural observations,

91
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:05,023
and how I hope my past experience
can lead to a change that results

92
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,461
in less suffering for others.

93
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,314
In 1998, I lost my reputation
and my dignity.

94
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:18,814
I lost almost everything,

95
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:21,925
and I almost lost my life.

96
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,119
Let me paint a picture for you.

97
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,686
It is September of 1998.

98
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:35,372
I'm sitting in a windowless office room

99
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:38,436
inside the Office
of the Independent Counsel

100
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:42,871
underneath humming fluorescent lights.

101
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:46,702
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,

102
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:50,440
my voice on surreptitiously
taped phone calls

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,576
that a supposed friend
had made the year before.

104
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:57,151
I'm here because
I've been legally required

105
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:03,014
to personally authenticate
all 20 hours of taped conversation.

106
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:09,001
For the past eight months,
the mysterious content of these tapes

107
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,949
has hung like the Sword
of Damocles over my head.

108
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,035
I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?

109
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:21,123
Scared and mortified, I listen,

110
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:27,375
listen as I prattle on
about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;

111
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,246
listen as I confess my love
for the president,

112
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,625
and, of course, my heartbreak;

113
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:39,443
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

114
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:44,162
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;

115
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,941
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,

116
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:50,625
to the worst version of myself,

117
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,137
a self I don't even recognize.

118
00:07:56,357 --> 00:08:00,479
A few days later, the Starr Report
is released to Congress,

119
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,590
and all of those tapes and transcripts,
those stolen words, form a part of it.

120
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,781
That people can read the transcripts
is horrific enough,

121
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,528
but a few weeks later,

122
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:16,825
the audio tapes are aired on TV,

123
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:20,411
and significant portions
made available online.

124
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:27,065
The public humiliation was excruciating.

125
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:30,528
Life was almost unbearable.

126
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:37,874
This was not something that happened
with regularity back then in 1998,

127
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:43,656
and by this, I mean the stealing
of people's private words, actions,

128
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,279
conversations or photos,

129
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,858
and then making them public --

130
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,295
public without consent,

131
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:53,757
public without context,

132
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,351
and public without compassion.

133
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:01,001
Fast forward 12 years to 2010,

134
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:04,158
and now social media has been born.

135
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:10,010
The landscape has sadly become much
more populated with instances like mine,

136
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,028
whether or not someone
actually make a mistake,

137
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:18,740
and now it's for both public
and private people.

138
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,669
The consequences for some
have become dire, very dire.

139
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:28,167
I was on the phone with my mom

140
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,884
in September of 2010,

141
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:32,741
and we were talking about the news

142
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,533
of a young college freshman
from Rutgers University

143
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,686
named Tyler Clementi.

144
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,624
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler

145
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,003
was secretly webcammed by his roommate

146
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:46,776
while being intimate with another man.

147
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,084
When the online world
learned of this incident,

148
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:54,219
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.

149
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,818
A few days later,

150
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:01,534
Tyler jumped from 
the George Washington Bridge

151
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,067
to his death.

152
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,014
He was 18.

153
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:12,167
My mom was beside herself about
what happened to Tyler and his family,

154
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,722
and she was gutted with pain

155
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:18,390
in a way that I just couldn't
quite understand,

156
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,760
and then eventually I realized

157
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,741
she was reliving 1998,

158
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:27,774
reliving a time when she sat
by my bed every night,

159
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:36,617
reliving a time when she made me shower
with the bathroom door open,

160
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:40,727
and reliving a time
when both of my parents feared

161
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,677
that I would be humiliated to death,

162
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,989
literally.

163
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,106
Today, too many parents

164
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:54,448
haven't had the chance to step in
and rescue their loved ones.

165
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:58,629
Too many have learned
of their child's suffering and humiliation

166
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:01,194
after it was too late.

167
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:06,361
Tyler's tragic, senseless death
was a turning point for me.

168
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:10,402
It served to recontextualize
my experiences,

169
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:14,697
and I then began to look at the world
of humiliation and bullying around me

170
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:18,180
and see something different.

171
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,404
In 1998, we had no way of knowing
where this brave new technology

172
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:26,074
called the Internet would take us.

173
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:30,282
Since then, it has connected people
in unimaginable ways,

174
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:32,199
joining lost siblings,

175
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,270
saving lives, launching revolutions,

176
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,120
but the darkness, cyberbullying,
and slut-shaming that I experienced

177
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,625
had mushroomed.

178
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:49,665
Every day online, people,
especially young people

179
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:52,592
who are not developmentally
equipped to handle this,

180
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:55,124
are so abused and humiliated

181
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,816
that they can't imagine living
to the next day,

182
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,965
and some, tragically, don't,

183
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:03,721
and there's nothing virtual about that.

184
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:11,448
ChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused
on helping young people on various issues,

185
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:15,129
released a staggering statistic
late last year:

186
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,750
From 2012 to 2013,

187
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,024
there was an 87 percent increase

188
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:26,900
in calls and emails related
to cyberbullying.

189
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,082
A meta-analysis done
out of the Netherlands

190
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,077
showed that for the first time,

191
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:36,119
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations

192
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:40,019
more significantly than offline bullying.

193
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,780
And you know what shocked me,
although it shouldn't have,

194
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,717
was other research last year
that determined humiliation

195
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,715
was a more intensely felt emotion

196
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:54,775
than either happiness or even anger.

197
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,310
Cruelty to others is nothing new,

198
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,690
but online, technologically
enhanced shaming is amplified,

199
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,007
uncontained, and permanently accessible.

200
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:16,697
The echo of embarrassment used to extend
only as far as your family, village,

201
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:19,041
school or community,

202
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,919
but now it's the online community too.

203
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,761
Millions of people, often anonymously,

204
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:29,754
can stab you with their words,
and that's a lot of pain,

205
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:32,890
and there are no perimeters
around how many people

206
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,978
can publicly observe you

207
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:38,397
and put you in a public stockade.

208
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:42,006
There is a very personal price

209
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,120
to public humiliation,

210
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,721
and the growth of the Internet
has jacked up that price.

211
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:54,088
For nearly two decades now,

212
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:58,206
we have slowly been sowing the seeds
of shame and public humiliation

213
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:04,027
in our cultural soil,
both on- and offline.

214
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:08,925
Gossip websites, paparazzi,
reality programming, politics,

215
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:14,761
news outlets and sometimes hackers
all traffic in shame.

216
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,979
It's led to desensitization
and a permissive environment online

217
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:25,341
which lends itself to trolling,
invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.

218
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:29,126
This shift has created
what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls

219
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,910
a culture of humiliation.

220
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,089
Consider a few prominent examples
just from the past six months alone.

221
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,173
Snapchat, the service which is used
mainly by younger generations

222
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,868
and claims that its messages
only have the lifespan

223
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,571
of a few seconds.

224
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,981
You can imagine the range
of content that that gets.

225
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:55,114
A third-party app which Snapchatters
use to preserve the lifespan

226
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:57,808
of the messages was hacked,

227
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:04,658
and 100,000 personal conversations,
photos, and videos were leaked online

228
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:08,915
to now have a lifespan of forever.

229
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:13,071
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
had their iCloud accounts hacked,

230
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:17,018
and private, intimate, nude photos
were plastered across the Internet

231
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,900
without their permission.

232
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,032
One gossip website
had over five million hits

233
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:25,607
for this one story.

234
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:30,346
And what about the Sony Pictures
cyberhacking?

235
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,343
The documents which received
the most attention

236
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:39,379
were private emails that had
maximum public embarrassment value.

237
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,629
But in this culture of humiliation,

238
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,719
there is another kind of price tag
attached to public shaming.

239
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,617
The price does not measure
the cost to the victim,

240
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,870
which Tyler and too many others,

241
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,844
notably women, minorities,

242
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:59,022
and members of the LGBTQ
community have paid,

243
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:03,578
but the price measures the profit
of those who prey on them.

244
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,751
This invasion of others is a raw material,

245
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:14,741
efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
packaged and sold at a profit.

246
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:20,523
A marketplace has emerged
where public humiliation is a commodity

247
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:23,867
and shame is an industry.

248
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,559
How is the money made?

249
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,393
Clicks.

250
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,924
The more shame, the more clicks.

251
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,778
The more clicks,
the more advertising dollars.

252
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,453
We're in a dangerous cycle.

253
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,378
The more we click on this kind of gossip,

254
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:46,099
the more numb we get
to the human lives behind it,

255
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:51,555
and the more numb we get,
the more we click.

256
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:54,478
All the while, someone is making money

257
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:57,361
off of the back 
of someone else's suffering.

258
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:01,494
With every click, we make a choice.

259
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:04,906
The more we saturate our culture
with public shaming,

260
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:06,765
the more accepted it is,

261
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:09,968
the more we will see behavior
like cyberbullying,

262
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,615
trolling, some forms of hacking,

263
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,541
and online harassment.

264
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:23,249
Why? Because they all have
humiliation at their cores.

265
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:27,545
This behavior is a symptom
of the culture we've created.

266
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,852
Just think about it.

267
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,464
Changing behavior begins
with evolving beliefs.

268
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:37,970
We've seen that to be true
with racism, homophobia,

269
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,920
and plenty of other biases,
today and in the past.

270
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,888
As we've changed beliefs
about same-sex marriage,

271
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:50,370
more people have been
offered equal freedoms.

272
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,553
When we began valuing sustainability,

273
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:55,501
more people began to recycle.

274
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,776
So as far as our culture
of humiliation goes,

275
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:02,421
what we need is a cultural revolution.

276
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:06,344
Public shaming
as a blood sport has to stop,

277
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:11,221
and it's time for an intervention
on the Internet and in our culture.

278
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,897
The shift begins with something simple,
but it's not easy.

279
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:22,592
We need to return to a long-held value
of compassion -- compassion and empathy.

280
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,779
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,

281
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,841
an empathy crisis.

282
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,815
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,

283
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:36,391
"Shame can't survive empathy."

284
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:40,835
Shame cannot survive empathy.

285
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:45,956
I've seen some very dark days in my life,

286
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:52,017
and it was the compassion and empathy
from my family, friends, professionals,

287
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:56,093
and sometimes even strangers
that saved me.

288
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,948
Even empathy from one person
can make a difference.

289
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,811
The theory of minority influence,

290
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,015
proposed by social psychologist
Serge Moscovici,

291
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,801
says that even in small numbers,

292
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,053
when there's consistency over time,

293
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,654
change can happen.

294
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,881
In the online world,
we can foster minority influence

295
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,308
by becoming upstanders.

296
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:25,034
To become an upstander means
instead of bystander apathy,

297
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:30,272
we can post a positive comment for someone
or report a bullying situation.

298
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:34,425
Trust me, compassionate comments
help abate the negativity.

299
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:39,013
We can also counteract the culture
by supporting organizations

300
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,289
that deal with these kinds of issues,

301
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,097
like the Tyler Clementi
Foundation in the U.S.,

302
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,908
In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,

303
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:50,500
and in Australia, there's Project Rockit.

304
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,977
We talk a lot about our right
to freedom of expression,

305
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,002
but we need to talk more about

306
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:03,556
our responsibility
to freedom of expression.

307
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:06,295
We all want to be heard,

308
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:11,078
but let's acknowledge the difference
between speaking up with intention

309
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,194
and speaking up for attention.

310
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:19,042
The Internet is 
the superhighway for the id,

311
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:22,200
but online, showing empathy to others

312
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,750
benefits us all and helps create
a safer and better world.

313
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,954
We need to communicate
online with compassion,

314
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,415
consume news with compassion,

315
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:36,109
and click with compassion.

316
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,743
Just imagine walking a mile
in someone else's headline.

317
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,281
I'd like to end on a personal note.

318
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,471
In the past nine months,

319
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:52,995
the question I've been 
asked the most is why.

320
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:57,013
Why now? Why was I 
sticking my head above the parapet?

321
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,530
You can read between the lines
in those questions,

322
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,379
and the answer has nothing
to do with politics.

323
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:08,986
The top note answer was and is
because it's time:

324
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:11,693
time to stop tip-toeing around my past;

325
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:14,935
time to stop living a life of opprobrium;

326
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:18,169
and time to take back my narrative.

327
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:23,014
It's also not just about saving myself.

328
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:26,427
Anyone who is suffering from shame
and public humiliation

329
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:29,214
needs to know one thing:

330
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,931
You can survive it.

331
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,694
I know it's hard.

332
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:38,325
It may not be painless, quick or easy,

333
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:43,001
but you can insist
on a different ending to your story.

334
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,368
Have compassion for yourself.

335
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,456
We all deserve compassion,

336
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:55,655
and to live both online and off
in a more compassionate world.

337
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:58,255
Thank you for listening.

338
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:08,635
(Applause)
