1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,820
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
and I got a B+. (Laughter)

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,820
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
And I'm gonna try and do that within

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,820
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
and to follow the TED commandments:

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
that is, actually, something that creates

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
a near-death experience,

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
but near-death is good for creativity.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
(Laughter) OK.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
So, I also want to explain,

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,820
if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and the one that's in between that is the censor

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And I'm going do that also by looking at

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
what I think is part of my creative process,

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
which includes a number of things that happened, actually --

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
the nothing started even earlier than the moment

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
in which I'm creating something new.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,820
And that includes nature, and nurture,

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and what I refer to as nightmares.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
we are innately equipped with something, perhaps

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
in our brains, some abnormal chromosome

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,820
that causes this muse-like effect.

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,820
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
And others, like my mother,

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,820
would say that I get my material from past lives.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Some people would also say that creativity

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,820
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --

36
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,820
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,

39
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,820
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
And I will mention that I actually developed

43
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,820
temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
but it was during the time I was writing my last book,

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,820
and some people say that book is quite different.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:

47
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,820
you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
why am I not black like everybody else?

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
And sometimes you're equipped with skills,

50
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,820
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
And I had a miniature poodle.

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.

54
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,820
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,820
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,820
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
my living out of the artful arrangement of words.

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,820
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
That figure right there, by the way,

64
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,820
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,

65
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,820
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
this was supposed to be my side occupation,

68
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
and it led to a sense of failure.

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
But actually, there was something quite real in my life

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
that happened when I was about 14.

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
six months later, had brain tumors.

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,820
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,820
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
and that God's will would take care of that.

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.

78
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses

79
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
why this would have happened.

81
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
There was a reason for everything.

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,

84
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,820
who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.

85
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
And so, I had this notion of death all around me,

86
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,820
because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.

87
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,

88
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,820
you begin to think very much about everything.

89
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
You become very creative, in a survival sense.

90
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,820
And this, then, led to my big questions.

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
And they're the same ones that I have today.

92
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,820
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?

93
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,820
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,820
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.

95
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,

96
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,820
you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,

97
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
in what order they happen. What are the influences?

98
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,820
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?

99
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.

100
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,820
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,

101
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
as the creator of that universe.

102
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,820
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth

103
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out

104
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,820
-- years and years, oftentimes.

105
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,820
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability

106
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,820
to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.

107
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,820
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on

108
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
throughout this conference,

109
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
almost everything that's been going on.

110
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,820
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:

111
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,820
quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,

112
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
but I'm still gonna use it as the process

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,820
for explaining how it is the metaphor.

114
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,820
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.

115
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,820
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,820
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.

117
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
But when you make those associations,

118
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,820
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,

119
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,820
and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.

120
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,820
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.

121
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,820
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,

122
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
as I understand it. (Laughter)

123
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And this happens constantly in the writing.

124
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,

125
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
in which you're looking for something, and

126
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
you know, things are happening simultaneously,

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
and you're looking at it in a different way,

128
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,820
and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,

129
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,820
or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,

130
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
then you will only write the about.

131
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
You won't discover anything.

132
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
And what you were supposed to find,

133
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,

134
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
is no longer there.

135
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Now, I don't want to ignore

136
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
the other side of what happens in our universe,

137
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
like many of our scientists have.

138
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,

139
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
and just say that creative people are multidimensional,

140
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,820
and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.

141
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,820
(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.

142
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
There is also a big question of ambiguity.

143
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,820
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.

144
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.

145
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable

146
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.

147
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,820
It is constantly there. And, just as an example,

148
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
this is one that recently came to me.

149
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman

150
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,

151
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

152
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.

153
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there

154
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,820
until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.

155
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,820
So, there was another one that I came across,

156
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
and it's "saving fish from drowning."

157
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,

158
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
because they're not supposed to kill anything.

159
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.

160
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,820
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,

161
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.

162
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors

163
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,

164
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:

165
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,

167
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
or you're going to get stuck.

168
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,820
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.

169
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,820
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,

170
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,820
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.

171
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,820
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.

172
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And then we have intentions.

173
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,820
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,

174
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
and then we do something.

175
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.

176
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?

177
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
What are we supposed to do?

178
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Do we stay in for life,

179
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,820
or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,

180
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,820
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?

181
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
That is the ambiguity in my life

182
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,820
that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called

183
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
"Saving Fish From Drowning."

184
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,820
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.

185
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
I got these hints everywhere.

186
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.

187
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,

188
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,820
and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.

189
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,820
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.

190
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
And when I have the question, it is a focus.

191
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,820
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through

192
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,820
that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.

193
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
And it seems like it's happening all the time.

194
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,

195
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
in which you're getting all this help from the universe.

196
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.

197
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
And you are noticing it more often.

198
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
But you apply this.

199
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.

200
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?

201
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Why or why not?

202
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,820
It may be something that is perhaps more serious

203
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
-- as I said, human rights in Burma.

204
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show

205
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
that I approved of the military regime there.

206
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,

207
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions

208
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
that other people have given us?"

209
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,

210
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,820
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,

211
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
who was a Baptist minister.

212
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,820
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,

213
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
and still didn't know that if I went there,

214
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --

215
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,820
and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.

216
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,820
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.

217
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,820
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?

218
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,

219
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,820
so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?

220
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,

221
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
and we talked about today, is genocide.

222
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
This leads to this question.

223
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,820
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,

224
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
and I consider what my intentions should be,

225
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,820
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child

226
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,

227
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
and what is my place in the universe?

228
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.

229
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,820
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,

230
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,820
and yet it is also absolutely necessary.

231
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,820
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.

232
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.

233
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,

234
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.

235
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,

236
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,

237
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,

238
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and that actually was the way it happened.

239
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.

240
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
There are also things, quite uncanny,

241
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.

242
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
In this case, I was writing a story

243
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,820
that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.

245
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
And I took down this book, and I --

246
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,820
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,

248
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,820
happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,

249
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
and a character who thought he was the son of God.

250
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
You wonder, are these things random chance?

251
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?

252
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,820
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?

253
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
And that goes into the story, too.

254
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.

255
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Especially when good things happen,

256
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,820
and, in particular, when bad things happen.

257
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,

258
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
and I do want to know what those elements are,

259
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,820
so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.

260
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.

261
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place

262
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,820
-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,

263
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,820
and we ended up in this non-tourist location,

264
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
a beautiful village, pristine.

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
And we walked three valleys beyond,

266
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,

267
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,820
a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.

268
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.

269
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,820
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.

270
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.

271
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,

272
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,

273
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
walking along the beach, I came across this.

274
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
And it was a man, a Chinese man,

275
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.

276
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"

277
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."

278
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,820
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.

279
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,820
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,

280
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
and I cannot explain it.

281
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence

282
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
in writing about these things?

283
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?

284
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.

285
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.

286
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
What is the nature of accidents?

287
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,820
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,

288
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
outside of a court of law?

289
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I was able to see that in a firsthand way,

290
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,820
when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.

291
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.

292
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me

293
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
if I wanted to write anything about China.

294
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,820
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.

295
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,820
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,

296
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,

297
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.

298
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,820
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.

299
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
Responsibility was assigned to the family.

300
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,820
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.

301
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,820
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.

302
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
It's the son, not the father."

303
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,820
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.

304
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,820
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.

305
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.

306
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,820
And I began to sense something different about the history,

307
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,820
and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,

308
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links

309
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:45,820
with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.

310
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,820
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,

311
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:58,820
a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men

312
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,820
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.

313
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,

314
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,

315
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
and seeing the amazing things that happened,

316
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,820
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,

317
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
determining how things happen.

318
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,

319
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,820
the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me

320
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,820
-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,

321
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
and that is where I'm gonna find the answers

322
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,820
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

323
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,

324
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,820
as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.

325
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,820
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.

326
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,820
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.

327
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,820
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?

328
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,820
And how do I create my own life?

329
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
And I think it is by questioning,

330
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,820
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.

331
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,820
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,

332
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
and the past, the specifics of that past,

333
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,820
and what is happening in the story at that point.

334
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,820
I also believe that in thinking about things --

335
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,820
my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,

336
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,820
God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --

337
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,820
I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.

338
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,

339
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,820
and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?

340
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:53,820
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --

341
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,820
and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.

342
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:04,820
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.

343
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
And they have to be in all possibilities,

344
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,820
including those I never considered before.

345
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,820
So, there are never complete answers.

346
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind

347
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,820
myself that there is uncertainty in everything,

348
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,820
and that is good, because then I will discover something new.

349
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,820
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,

350
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
it is to simply imagine.

351
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,820
And to imagine is to put myself in that story,

352
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,820
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.

353
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,820
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story

354
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,820
-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,

355
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,820
to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Because for everything,

357
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,820
in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.

358
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,820
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.

359
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
We've come to the end of the talk,

360
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,820
and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,

361
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
and it is the things that transform in our lives,

362
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:30,820
that are wonderful and stay with us.

363
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,820
There she is.

364
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Thank you very much!

365
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,820
(Applause)
