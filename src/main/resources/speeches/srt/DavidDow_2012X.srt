00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:15,280
Two weeks ago,

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,387
I was sitting at the

3
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:20,387
kitchen table with my wife Katya,

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,253
and we were talking about what I was gonna talk about today.

5
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:30,280
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,973
doing his math homework.

7
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:34,390
And during a pause in my conversation

8
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:38,087
with Katya, I looked over at Lincoln

9
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,953
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

10
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:45,453
by a recollection of a client of mine.

11
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:48,345
My client was a guy named Will.

12
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,263
He was from North Texas.

13
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:55,359
He never knew his father very well, because his father left

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,053
his mom while she was pregnant with him.

15
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:03,420
And so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom,

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,987
which might have been all right

17
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,153
except that this particular single mom

18
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:10,474
was a paranoid schizophrenic,

19
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:15,087
and when Will was five years old she
tried to kill him with a butcher knife.

20
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,020
She was

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,155
taken away by authorities and placed in a
psychiatric hospital,

22
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:24,887
and so for the next several years Will
lived with his older brother

23
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:27,772
until he committed suicide by shooting
himself through the heart.

24
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:30,853
And after that

25
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,887
Will bounced around from one family
member to another,

26
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:39,220
until, by the time he was nine years old,
he was essentially living on his own.

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,608
That morning that I was sitting with
Katya and Lincoln, I looked at my son,

28
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,653
and I realized that when my client, Will,

29
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:49,720
was his age,

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,753
he'd been living by himself for two years.

31
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:56,333
Will eventually joined a gang

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,680
and committed

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,620
a number of very serious crimes,

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,453
including, most seriously of all,

35
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,749
a horrible, tragic murder.

36
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:11,320
And Will was ultimately executed

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,253
as punishment for that crime.

38
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:16,256
But I don't want to

39
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:17,928
talk today

40
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:22,177
about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client

41
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:27,187
shouldn't have been executed, but what I would like to do today instead

42
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,072
is talk about the death penalty

43
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:32,620
in a way I've never done before,

44
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:33,920
in a way

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,453
that is entirely noncontroversial.

46
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:39,336
I think that's possible,

47
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,053
because there is a corner

48
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,934
of the death penalty debate --

49
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,720
maybe the most important corner --

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,903
where everybody agrees,

51
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,853
where the most ardent death penalty supporters

52
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,867
and the most vociferous abolitionists

53
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:59,770
are on exactly the same page.

54
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,485
That's the corner I want to explore.

55
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:07,572
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death

56
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,587
penalty case unfolds,

57
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:15,025
and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years

58
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:17,387
as a death penalty lawyer,

59
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:22,287
from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

60
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:26,120
You can think of a death penalty case as
a story

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,287
that has four chapters.

62
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,553
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same,

63
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:33,439
and it is tragic.

64
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,545
It begins with the murder

65
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:37,409
of an innocent human being,

66
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:39,053
and it's followed by a trial

67
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,453
where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row,

68
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,354
and that death sentence is ultimately

69
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,487
upheld by the state appellate court.

70
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:50,413
The second chapter consists of a
complicated legal proceeding known as

71
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,106
a state habeas corpus appeal.

72
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:56,587
The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a

73
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:58,753
federal habeas corpus proceeding.

74
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,520
And the fourth chapter

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,670
is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition,

76
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,804
they might initiate even more complex
litigation,

77
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,153
or they might not do anything at all.

78
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,787
But that fourth chapter always ends

79
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:14,087
with an execution.

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,950
When I started representing death row
inmates more than 20 years ago,

81
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,887
people on death row did not have a right
to a lawyer in either the second

82
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,587
or the fourth chapter of this story.

83
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,100
They were on their own.

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,537
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s that they acquired a

85
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,743
right to a lawyer during the third chapter

86
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,577
of the story.

87
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,253
So what all of these death row inmates had to do

88
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:40,253
was rely on volunteer lawyers

89
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,449
to handle their legal proceedings.

90
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,537
The problem is that there were way more
guys on death row

91
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:51,053
than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.

92
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,553
And so inevitably,

93
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:56,253
lawyers drifted to cases that were
already in chapter four --

94
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,487
that makes sense, of course. Those are the
cases that are most urgent;

95
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,153
those are the guys who are closest to being executed.

96
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:06,342
Some of these lawyers were successful; they managed to get new trials for their clients.

97
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:10,287
Others of them managed to extend
the lives of their clients, sometimes by

98
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,287
years, sometimes by months.

99
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:14,387
But the one thing that didn't happen

100
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:19,220
was that there was never a serious and
sustained decline in the number of

101
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,620
annual executions in Texas.

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,387
In fact, as you can see from this graph,
from the time that the Texas execution

103
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:28,720
apparatus got efficient in the mid- to
late-1990s,

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,053
there've only been a couple of years where
the number of annual executions dipped

105
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,220
below 20.

106
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,760
In a typical year in Texas,

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,012
we're averaging about

108
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,684
two people a month.

109
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:45,320
In some years in Texas, we've executed
close to 40 people, and this number

110
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,042
has never significantly declined over
the last 15 years.

111
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:53,687
And yet, at the same time that we
continue to execute

112
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,787
about the same number of people every
year,

113
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,355
the number of people who we're sentencing
to death

114
00:05:58,355 --> 00:05:59,516
on an annual basis

115
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:02,000
has dropped rather steeply.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,387
So we have this paradox,

117
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:08,107
which is that the number of annual
executions has remained high

118
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:12,542
but the number of new death sentences
has gone down.

119
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,820
Why is that?

120
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,587
It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate,

121
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:18,420
because the murder rate has not declined

122
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,687
nearly so steeply as the red line on
that graph has gone down.

123
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,553
What has happened instead is

124
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:29,387
that juries have started to sentence
more and more people to prison

125
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:32,887
for the rest of their lives without the
possibility of parole,

126
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:36,203
rather than sending them to the
execution chamber.

127
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,553
Why has that happened?

128
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:42,960
it hasn't happened because of a
dissolution of popular support

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,520
for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact

130
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,180
that death penalty support in Texas is at
an all-time low.

131
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,187
Do you know what all-time low in Texas
means?

132
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,753
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.

133
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:59,487
Now that's really good compared to the
mid 1980s, when it was in

134
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,211
excess of 80 percent,

135
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:05,620
but we can't explain the decline in
death sentences and the affinity for

136
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,487
life without the possibility of parole
by an erosion of support for the death

137
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,953
penalty, because people still support the
death penalty.

138
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:15,027
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?

139
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,653
What's happened is

140
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:17,558
that lawyers

141
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:21,253
who represent death row inmates have
shifted their focus

142
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:25,755
to earlier and earlier chapters of the
death penalty story.

143
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:29,020
So 25 years ago, they focused on
chapter four.

144
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,883
And they went from chapter four 25 years ago to chapter three

145
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:34,587
in the late 1980s.

146
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,987
And they went from chapter three in the
late 1980s to chapter two in

147
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:41,187
the mid-1990s. And beginning
in the mid- to late-1990s,

148
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,377
they began to focus on chapter one of
the story.

149
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:48,387
Now you might think that this decline in
death sentences and the increase in the

150
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,853
number of life sentences is a good thing
or a bad thing.

151
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,409
I don't want to have a conversation about that
today.

152
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,567
All that I want to tell you is that the
reason that this has happened

153
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,679
is because death penalty lawyers have
understood

154
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,453
that the earlier you intervene in a
case,

155
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,953
the greater the likelihood that you're
going to save your client's life.

156
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,820
That's the first thing I've learned.

157
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,755
Here's the second thing I learned:

158
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:11,920
My client Will

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,376
was not the exception to the rule;

160
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,453
he was the rule.

161
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,987
I sometimes say, if you tell me the name
of a death row inmate --

162
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:25,035
doesn't matter what state he's in, doesn't matter if I've ever met him before --

163
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:27,653
I'll write his biography for you.

164
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:30,853
And eight out of 10 times,

165
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,487
the details of that biography

166
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,950
will be more or less accurate.

167
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,953
And the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row are

168
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:42,920
people who came from the same sort of
dysfunctional family that Will did.

169
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,888
Eighty percent of the people on death row

170
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:47,020
are people who had exposure

171
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,653
to the juvenile justice system.

172
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,784
That's the second lesson

173
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,587
that I've learned.

174
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:56,987
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner

175
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:00,133
where everybody's going to agree.

176
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,326
People in this room might disagree

177
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,439
about whether Will should have been
executed,

178
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,953
but I think everybody would agree

179
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:10,653
that the best possible version of his story

180
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:11,987
would be a story

181
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:16,769
where no murder ever occurs.

182
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,753
How do we do that?

183
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:22,783
When our son Lincoln was working on that
math problem

184
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:25,825
two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.

185
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,308
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem,

186
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:33,220
sometimes the solution is to slice it
into smaller problems.

187
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,787
That's what we do for most problems -- in
math and physics, even in social policy --

188
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:40,553
we slice them into smaller, more
manageable problems.

189
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:42,288
But every once in a while,

190
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,320
as Dwight Eisenhower said,

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
the way you solve a problem

192
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
is to make it bigger.

193
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,853
The way we solve this problem

194
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:55,709
is to make the issue of the death
penalty bigger.

195
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,953
We have to say, all right.

196
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:00,214
We have these four chapters

197
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:03,053
of a death penalty story,

198
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,820
but what happens before

199
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,947
that story begins?

200
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:11,753
How can we intervene in the life of a murderer

201
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,420
before he's a murderer?

202
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,769
What options do we have

203
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,153
to nudge that person

204
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,387
off of the path

205
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:23,550
that is going to lead to a result that
everybody --

206
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,406
death penalty supporters and death penalty
opponents --

207
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,153
still think

208
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,587
is a bad result:

209
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,153
the murder of an innocent human being?

210
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,753
You know, sometimes people say

211
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:37,993
that something

212
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:40,120
isn't rocket science.

213
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,453
And by that, what they mean is rocket
science is really complicated

214
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:46,955
and this problem that we're talking
about now is really simple.

215
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,387
Well that's rocket science;

216
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,187
that's the mathematical expression

217
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:54,053
for the thrust created by a rocket.

218
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,420
What we're talking about today

219
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,821
is just as complicated.

220
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,445
What we're talking about today is also

221
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:04,092
rocket science.

222
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:05,903
My client Will

223
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,573
and 80 percent of the people on
death row

224
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:12,020
had five chapters in their lives

225
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,553
that came before

226
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,353
the four chapters of the death penalty
story.

227
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:20,120
I think of these five chapters as points
of intervention,

228
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,987
places in their lives when our society

229
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:27,920
could've intervened in their lives and
nudged them off of the path that they were on

230
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,188
that created a consequence that we all -- death penalty supporters or death

231
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,906
penalty opponents --

232
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,926
say was a bad result.

233
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:38,553
Now, during each of these five
chapters:

234
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,187
when his mother was pregnant with him;

235
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,453
in his early childhood years;

236
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,320
when he was in elementary school;

237
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,487
when he was in middle school and then high
school;

238
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,987
and when he was in the juvenile justice
system -- during each of those five chapters,

239
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:53,202
there were a wide variety of things that society could have done.

240
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,320
In fact, if we just imagine

241
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,420
that there are five different modes of
intervention, the way that society could intervene

242
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,304
in each of those five chapters,

243
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,520
and we could mix and match them any way
we want,

244
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,690
there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies

245
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,553
that we could embrace in order to nudge
kids like Will

246
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,387
off of the path that they're on.

247
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,142
So I'm not standing here today

248
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,220
with the solution.

249
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,753
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn,

250
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:27,126
that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.

251
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:30,020
We know from experience in other states

252
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,687
that there are a wide variety of modes
of intervention

253
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:37,575
that we could be using in Texas, and in
every other state that isn't using them,

254
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:42,568
in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.

255
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,191
I'll just mention a few.

256
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:49,116
I won't talk today about reforming the
legal system.

257
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:53,887
That's probably a topic that is best
reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.

258
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,707
Instead, let me talk about a couple of
modes of intervention

259
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,075
that we can all help accomplish,

260
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:02,560
because they are modes of intervention
that will come about

261
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,520
when legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens,

262
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,753
agree that that's what we ought to be
doing

263
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,087
and that's how we ought to be spending our money.

264
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,473
We could be providing early childhood care

265
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:19,287
for economically disadvantaged and
otherwise troubled kids,

266
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,670
and we could be doing it for free.

267
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,780
And we could be nudging kids like Will
off of the path that we're on.

268
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,620
There are other states that do that, but we don't.

269
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,721
We could be providing special schools, at
both the high school level

270
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:37,088
and the middle school level, but even in K-5,

271
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:41,477
that target economically and otherwise
disadvantaged kids, and particularly kids

272
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,653
who have had exposure

273
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:44,753
to the juvenile justice system.

274
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,620
There are a handful of states that do that;

275
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,302
Texas doesn't.

276
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,120
There's one other thing we can be doing --

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,458
well, there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing -- there's one other thing that we could be

278
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,020
doing that I'm going to mention, and this is
gonna be the only controversial thing

279
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,653
that I say today.

280
00:13:58,653 --> 00:13:59,953
We could be intervening

281
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,053
much more aggressively

282
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:05,277
into dangerously dysfunctional homes,

283
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,120
and getting kids out of them

284
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,591
before their moms pick up butcher knives
and threaten to kill them.

285
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:14,611
If we're gonna do that,

286
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,687
we need a place to put them.

287
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:20,091
Even if we do all of those things, some
kids are going to fall through the cracks

288
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,687
and they're going to end up in that last
chapter before the murder story begins,

289
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,720
they're going to end up in the juvenile
justice system.

290
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,822
And even if that happens,

291
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,726
it's not yet too late.

292
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:33,520
There's still time to nudge them,

293
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,277
if we think about nudging them

294
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:37,646
rather than just punishing them.

295
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:40,386
There are two professors in the Northeast --
one at Yale and one at Maryland --

296
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,153
they set up a school

297
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:46,053
that is attached to a juvenile prison.

298
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,302
And the kids are in prison, but they go
to school from eight in the morning

299
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,987
until four in the afternoon.

300
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,623
Now, it was logistically difficult.

301
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:53,787
They had to recruit teachers

302
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:57,153
who wanted to teach inside a prison, they had to establish strict

303
00:14:57,153 --> 00:15:00,355
separation between the people who work
at the school and the prison authorities,

304
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:03,787
and most dauntingly of all, they needed
to invent a new curriculum because

305
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:04,787
you know what?

306
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:10,287
People don't come into and out of prison
on a semester basis.

307
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:13,404
But they did all those things.

308
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:16,153
Now what do all of these things have in common?

309
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:22,520
What all of these things have in common
is that they cost money.

310
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,548
Some of the people in the room might be
old enough to remember

311
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:29,310
the guy on the old oil filter commercial.

312
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,120
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now

313
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,187
or you can pay me later."

314
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,320
What we're doing

315
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,340
in the death penalty system

316
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,939
is we're paying later.

317
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,787
But the thing is

318
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:49,653
that for every 15,000 dollars
that we spend intervening

319
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:54,020
in the lives of economically and
otherwise disadvantaged kids

320
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,340
in those earlier chapters,

321
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,753
we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.

322
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:01,516
Even if you don't agree

323
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:03,912
that there's a moral imperative that we do it,

324
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,832
it just makes economic sense.

325
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:14,432
I want to tell you about the last conversation that
I had with Will.

326
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:18,520
It was the day that he was going to be executed,

327
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,832
and we were just talking.

328
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:23,887
There was nothing left to do

329
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:25,502
in his case.

330
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,853
And we were talking about his life.

331
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,720
And he was talking first about his dad,
who he hardly knew,

332
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,553
who had died,

333
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:34,187
and then about his mom,

334
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,951
who he did know,

335
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,120
who is still alive.

336
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,820
And I said to him,

337
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,871
"I know the story.

338
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,687
I've read the records.

339
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,329
I know that she tried to kill you."

340
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:49,767
I said, "But I've always wondered whether you
really

341
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,887
actually remember that."

342
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,390
I said, "I don't remember anything

343
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,549
from when I was five years old.

344
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,487
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."

345
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,987
And he looked at me and he leaned forward,

346
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,587
and he said, "Professor," -- he'd known me for
12 years, he still called me Professor.

347
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:07,902
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any
disrespect by this,

348
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,553
but when your mama

349
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:12,653
picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger
than you are,

350
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:16,453
and chases you through the house
screaming she's gonna kill you,

351
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,278
and you have to lock yourself in the
bathroom and lean against the door and

352
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:23,041
holler for help until the police get
there,"

353
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,120
he looked at me and he said,

354
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,620
"that's something you don't forget."

355
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,120
I hope there's one thing you all won't forget:

356
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,976
In between the time you arrived here
this morning and the time we break for lunch,

357
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:38,387
there are going to be four homicides

358
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,820
in the United States.

359
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,987
We're going to devote enormous social
resources to punishing the people who

360
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:46,287
commit those crimes, and that's
appropriate, because we should punish

361
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,353
people who do bad things.

362
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:51,920
But three of those crimes are
preventable.

363
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,830
If we make the picture bigger

364
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:59,636
and devote our attention to the
earlier chapters,

365
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:03,020
then we're never going to write the
first sentence

366
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,814
that begins the death penalty story.

367
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,520
Thank you.

368
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,851
(Applause)
