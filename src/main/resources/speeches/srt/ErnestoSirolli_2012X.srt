1
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:20,044
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --

2
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:24,029
my life -- has been shaped

3
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,853
by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.

4
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:33,374
From 1971 to 1977 --

5
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:37,254
I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --

6
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:42,187
I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,

7
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:46,404
in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.

8
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,522
I worked for an Italian NGO,

9
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:55,672
and every single project that we set up in Africa

10
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:59,116
failed.

11
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:03,260
And I was distraught.

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,508
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people

13
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,890
and we were doing good work in Africa.

14
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,903
Instead, everything we touched we killed.

15
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:23,006
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,

16
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,894
"Ripples from the Zambezi,"

17
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:28,459
was a project where we Italians

18
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:34,380
decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,729
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia

20
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,209
in this absolutely magnificent valley

21
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,462
going down to the Zambezi River,

22
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:49,090
and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,881
and zucchini and ...

24
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:54,076
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest

25
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:56,991
in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,

26
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,126
and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)

27
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,853
And we were amazed that the local people,

28
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,940
in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,148
But instead of asking them how come they were not

30
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:14,170
growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)

31
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,838
"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."

32
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,298
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.

33
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,956
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato

34
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:28,565
would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,386
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,

36
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:33,858
"Look how easy agriculture is."

37
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,869
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,

38
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:40,297
overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river

39
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:44,300
and they ate everything. (Laughter)

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,884
And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"

41
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:54,565
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)

42
00:02:54,565 --> 00:03:00,817
"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."

43
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:05,905
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,

44
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,649
but then I saw what the Americans were doing,

45
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:11,385
what the English were doing, what the French were doing,

46
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,978
and after seeing what they were doing,

47
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:17,337
I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.

48
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:22,326
Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.

49
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:26,573
You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --

50
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,067
You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed

51
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,867
on unsuspecting African people.

52
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,443
You want to read the book,

53
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:37,374
read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,

54
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,381
Zambian woman economist.

55
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:42,751
The book was published in 2009.

56
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:47,325
We Western donor countries have given the African continent

57
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:52,318
two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.

58
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,143
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.

59
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:58,331
Just go and read her book.

60
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:06,694
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.

61
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:12,661
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,

62
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:15,975
and there are only two ways we deal with people:

63
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:20,364
We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.

64
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:23,468
The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"

65
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,698
which means "father."

66
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,551
But they mean two different things.

67
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:32,912
Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture

68
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:38,715
as if they were my children. "I love you so much."

69
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:43,222
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture

70
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,620
as if they were my servants.

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,691
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.

72
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,274
I was given a slap in the face reading a book,

73
00:04:55,274 --> 00:05:00,241
"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,

74
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:03,199
above all in economic development, if people

75
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,754
do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.

76
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,581
This should be the first principle of aid.

77
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:14,267
The first principle of aid is respect.

78
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,795
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference

79
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:20,596
lay a stick on the floor, and said,

80
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:24,854
"Can we -- can you imagine a city

81
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:28,776
that is not neocolonial?"

82
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:32,929
I decided when I was 27 years old

83
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:37,136
to only respond to people,

84
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,560
and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,935
where you never initiate anything,

86
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:49,157
you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant

87
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,718
of the local passion, the servant of local people

88
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:57,116
who have a dream to become a better person.

89
00:05:57,116 --> 00:06:01,525
So what you do -- you shut up.

90
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,237
You never arrive in a community with any ideas,

91
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:09,676
and you sit with the local people.

92
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,868
We don't work from offices.

93
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,834
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.

94
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,149
We have zero infrastructure.

95
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,476
And what we do, we become friends,

96
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:27,236
and we find out what that person wants to do.

97
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,094
The most important thing is passion.

98
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:31,334
You can give somebody an idea.

99
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:32,956
If that person doesn't want to do it,

100
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:36,637
what are you going to do?

101
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:41,183
The passion that the person has for her own growth

102
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,909
is the most important thing.

103
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,466
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth

104
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,131
is the most important thing.

105
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,218
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,

106
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:57,687
because nobody in the world can succeed alone.

107
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,406
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,

108
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,544
but the knowledge is available.

109
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:06,403
So years and years ago, I had this idea:

110
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:10,569
Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community

111
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,272
to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,

112
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:20,097
listen to them? But not in community meetings.

113
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:25,011
Let me tell you a secret.

114
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,356
There is a problem with community meetings.

115
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:33,062
Entrepreneurs never come,

116
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:36,234
and they never tell you, in a public meeting,

117
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:39,850
what they want to do with their own money,

118
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,679
what opportunity they have identified.

119
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:48,603
So planning has this blind spot.

120
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:52,894
The smartest people in your community you don't even know,

121
00:07:52,894 --> 00:08:00,734
because they don't come to your public meetings.

122
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:04,694
What we do, we work one-on-one,

123
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,407
and to work one-on-one, you have to create

124
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:09,082
a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.

125
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,654
You have to create a new profession.

126
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:17,158
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,

127
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:20,729
the family doctor of business, who sits with you

128
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,854
in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,

129
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:27,892
and helps you find the resources to transform your passion

130
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:30,285
into a way to make a living.

131
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:35,606
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.

132
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,858
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,

133
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:42,181
trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit

134
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,993
that we arrive and tell you what to do.

135
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:50,573
And so what I did in Esperance that first year

136
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:55,199
was to just walk the streets, and in three days

137
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,093
I had my first client, and I helped this first guy

138
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:02,638
who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,

139
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:05,943
and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,

140
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:09,073
to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,

141
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:12,059
"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"

142
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,223
And I helped these five fishermen to work together

143
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:19,359
and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany

144
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,192
for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way

145
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:28,543
to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,

146
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:30,065
and the farmers came to talk to me, said,

147
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,354
"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"

148
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,280
In a year, I had 27 projects going on,

149
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,432
and the government came to see me to say,

150
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,819
"How can you do that?

151
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:43,145
How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.

152
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:48,798
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)

153
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:57,020
So — (Applause) —

154
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,625
So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)

155
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,783
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.

156
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:08,318
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.

157
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,990
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs

158
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,519
who are dying of solitude.

159
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,678
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,

160
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:23,230
died age 96, a few years ago.

161
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,010
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy

162
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,974
before becoming involved in business,

163
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:29,851
and this is what Peter Drucker says:

164
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:35,515
"Planning is actually incompatible

165
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,764
with an entrepreneurial society and economy."

166
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:46,007
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.

167
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,702
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch

168
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:52,183
without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch

169
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:56,841
want to do with their own money and their own energy.

170
00:10:56,841 --> 00:11:00,039
You have to learn how to get these people

171
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,036
to come and talk to you.

172
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:07,864
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,

173
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:11,648
you have to be fantastic at helping them,

174
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:15,642
and then they will come, and they will come in droves.

175
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,537
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.

176
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:21,109
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,

177
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,351
the intelligence and the passion?

178
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,882
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?

179
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:32,842
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.

180
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:38,113
So what I'm saying is that

181
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,580
entrepreneurship is where it's at.

182
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,726
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --

183
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:47,039
nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --

184
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,496
and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.

185
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,143
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.

186
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:57,464
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.

187
00:11:57,464 --> 00:12:00,552
What we have to look at is at how we

188
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:06,570
feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate

189
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,121
for seven billion people in a sustainable way.

190
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:14,015
The technologies do not exist to do that.

191
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:17,383
Who is going to invent the technology

192
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:23,881
for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!

193
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:26,774
Government? Forget about it!

194
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:32,028
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.

195
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:34,923
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine

196
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,596
many, many years ago.

197
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,816
There was a group of experts who were invited

198
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:43,444
to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.

199
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:45,934
And in 1860, this group of people came together,

200
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,881
and they all speculated about what would happen

201
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,735
to the city of New York in 100 years,

202
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,211
and the conclusion was unanimous:

203
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,152
The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.

204
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,413
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,

205
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:01,379
if the population keeps growing at this rate,

206
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,515
to move the population of New York around,

207
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:08,380
they would have needed six million horses,

208
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,735
and the manure created by six million horses

209
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:14,114
would be impossible to deal with.

210
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:19,744
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)

211
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:24,793
So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology

212
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:29,611
that is going to choke the life out of New York.

213
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:34,740
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,

214
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,343
in the United States of America, there were 1,001

215
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:45,723
car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.

216
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:49,329
The idea of finding a different technology

217
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,691
had absolutely taken over,

218
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:56,607
and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.

219
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,239
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.

220
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,610
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.

221
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,004
First, you have to offer them confidentiality.

222
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,342
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.

223
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:16,652
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,

224
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:20,104
passionate service to them.

225
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,751
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.

226
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,522
The smallest company, the biggest company,

227
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:29,912
has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:

228
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:34,163
The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,

229
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:37,987
you have to have fantastic marketing,

230
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:41,356
and you have to have tremendous financial management.

231
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,944
Guess what?

232
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:46,358
We have never met a single human being

233
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:52,005
in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.

234
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,836
It doesn't exist.

235
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,586
This person has never been born.

236
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,078
We've done the research, and we have looked

237
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,029
at the 100 iconic companies of the world --

238
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,610
Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,

239
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,213
all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.

240
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,889
There's only one thing that all the successful companies

241
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,377
in the world have in common, only one:

242
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:21,912
None were started by one person.

243
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:26,414
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds

244
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:29,955
in Northumberland, and we start the class

245
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:34,379
by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,

246
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,216
and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,

247
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:41,844
in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography

248
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,999
how many times Richard uses the word "I"

249
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,708
and how many times he uses the word "we."

250
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:52,448
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.

251
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:55,701
He wasn't alone when he started.

252
00:15:55,701 --> 00:16:00,745
Nobody started a company alone. No one.

253
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,851
So we can create the community

254
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:07,277
where we have facilitators who come from a small business background

255
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:14,774
sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies

256
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:18,446
who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman

257
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:21,687
who talks about this epic,

258
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:23,942
somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?

259
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,881
What can you do? Can you make it?

260
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:28,131
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"

261
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,885
"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"

262
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,973
We activate communities.

263
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:38,017
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator

264
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:41,140
to help you to find resources and people

265
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,129
and we have discovered that the miracle

266
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,633
of the intelligence of local people is such

267
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:50,340
that you can change the culture and the economy

268
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,521
of this community just by capturing the passion,

269
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:58,158
the energy and imagination of your own people.

270
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:02,851
Thank you. (Applause)
