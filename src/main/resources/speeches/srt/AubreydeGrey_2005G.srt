1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
where I get this thing to work.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
about doing anything about aging.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,820
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
namely, by actually doing something about it.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm going to do that in two steps.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
The first one I'm going to talk about is

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
who are already in middle-age when you start --

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
or indeed, to get sick in the first place.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
is how to reach that intermediate step,

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
that point of maybe 30 years life extension.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
So I'm going to start with why we should.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Now, I want to ask a question.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
That was easy. OK.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,820
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
And here is that characteristic.

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,820
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
which is something that was banned after a long struggle,

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
by the government not very many months ago.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.

45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,820
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.

48
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
It's a traditional part of the way of life,

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
because the majority of the British public,

53
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
came to the conclusion that it was really something

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.

56
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
And I think that human aging shares

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
all of these characteristics in spades.

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
What part of this do people not understand?

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
It's not just about life, of course --

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,820
(Laughter) --

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
it's about healthy life, you know --

62
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
whether or not dying may be fun.

64
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.

65
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
It's a global trance.

66
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses

67
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
that people give for aging.

68
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
that these excuses are completely valueless.

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
There are some good points to be made here,

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.

74
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
But these are completely crazy, when you actually

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
remember your sense of proportion.

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,820
You know, these are arguments; these are things that

77
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
would be legitimate to be concerned about.

78
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
But the question is, are they so dangerous --

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
these risks of doing something about aging --

80
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,820
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,

81
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
namely, leaving aging as it is?

82
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Are these so bad that they outweigh

83
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,820
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
then just don't waste my time, is what I say.

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
(Laughter)

87
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Now, there is one argument

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
People worry about overpopulation; they say,

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,

92
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.

93
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,

94
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and kids are really important to most people."

95
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
And that's true.

96
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,

97
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and give answers like this.

98
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.

99
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.

100
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,

101
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
or a high death rate.

102
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,

103
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,820
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
And, I say that that's fine --

105
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.

106
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,820
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.

107
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
If we vacillate, hesitate,

108
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
and do not actually develop these therapies,

109
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,820
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
who would have been young enough and healthy enough

111
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --

113
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
and I consider that that is immoral.

115
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Right. So the next thing is,

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
now why should we get a little bit more active on this?

118
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
And the fundamental answer is that

119
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.

120
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,820
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,

122
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,

123
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,820
and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons

125
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
why aging is actually a good thing after all.

126
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.

127
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
this becomes part of the problem.

130
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,820
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --

132
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --

133
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
in order to get people's attention, and make people realize

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
that they are in a trance in this regard.

135
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

136
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.

137
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,820
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable

138
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.

139
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
A very simple definition.

140
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,

141
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
which is to say, metabolism.

142
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
This is not a completely tautological statement;

143
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
it's a reasonable statement.

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,

145
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
and it also happens to us,

146
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,

147
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.

148
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as

149
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
has side effects.

151
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.

152
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:

153
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.

154
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
And there are really two games in town,

155
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.

156
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,820
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,

158
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
when pathology is becoming evident,

159
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,

160
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
and stop the accumulation of side effects

161
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
from causing the pathology quite so soon.

162
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,

163
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
because the things that are causing the pathology

164
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
are becoming more abundant as time goes on.

165
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,820
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,

166
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
because, you know, prevention is better than cure.

167
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.

168
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --

169
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
even cells we're not really too good on yet.

170
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
We've discovered things like, for example,

171
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
RNA interference only a few years ago,

172
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.

173
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,

174
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
but it is not an approach whose time has come

175
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
when we're talking about intervention.

176
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
So then, what do we do about that?

177
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,

178
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
pretty ironclad, doesn't it?

179
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
But it isn't.

180
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit

181
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
into what I'm calling step two.

182
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,820
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --

183
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --

184
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,820
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life

185
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.

186
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.

187
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,820
What would that actually mean

188
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
for how long people of various ages today --

189
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --

190
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
would actually live?

191
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,

192
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,820
but it's not simple.

193
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,

194
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
then they'll live 30 years longer."

195
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
That's the wrong answer.

196
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.

197
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
There are two sorts of technological progress really,

198
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
for this purpose.

199
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,

200
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.

201
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Now, they differ a great deal

202
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
in terms of the predictability of time frames.

203
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Fundamental breakthroughs:

204
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
very hard to predict how long it's going to take

205
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
to make a fundamental breakthrough.

206
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,

207
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.

208
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,820
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.

209
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened

210
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
in the progression of the technology of powered flight.

211
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
We can think, really, that each one is sort of

212
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.

213
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,820
The incremental advances have added up to something

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
which is not incremental anymore.

215
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.

216
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,

218
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
happening of course a bit later.

219
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --

220
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
you know, the same sort of time frame.

221
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,

222
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
isn't a step at all.

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
That in fact, the people who are young enough

224
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
to benefit from these first therapies

225
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
that give this moderate amount of life extension,

226
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,820
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,

227
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
will be at some sort of cusp.

228
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,820
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments

229
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.

230
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.

231
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
The therapies will be improving faster than

232
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,820
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
This is a very important point for me to get across.

234
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Because, you know, most people, when they hear

235
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,820
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,

236
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,820
they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades

237
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
that are so thoroughly eliminating aging

238
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.

239
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
I'm not saying that at all.

240
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies

241
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
will be enough.

242
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things

243
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.

244
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.

245
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
I decided to give this a little name,

246
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
which is "longevity escape velocity."

247
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
(Laughter)

248
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Well, it seems to get the point across.

249
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,820
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,

250
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
in terms of remaining life expectancy,

251
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
as measured by their health,

252
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.

253
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --

254
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
and an average 80-year-old,

255
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,

256
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
because you're too close to death's door

257
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,820
for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.

258
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
You won't be able to withstand them.

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance

260
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --

261
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,820
(Laughter) --

262
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
eventually get through this

263
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,

264
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,

265
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.

266
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,

267
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
then you're never really even going

268
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.

269
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,820
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --

270
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
we don't know how old that person is today,

271
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
because we don't know how long it's going to take

272
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
to get these first-generation therapies.

273
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
But irrespective of that age,

274
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,820
I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --

275
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --

276
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,820
is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.

277
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
And that's quite a thought.

278
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,

279
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;

280
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,820
namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension

281
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
that will allow us to get to escape velocity?

282
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,820
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.

283
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.

284
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.

285
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And this is what it is.

286
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,

287
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
which basically means mice that live about three years on average.

288
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.

289
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,

290
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
and with those therapies, we get them to live,

291
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
on average, to their fifth birthday.

292
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
So, in other words, we add two years --

293
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
we treble their remaining lifespan,

294
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
starting from the point that we started the therapies.

295
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame

296
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?

297
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Which we can now, as I've explained,

298
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.

299
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception

300
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,

301
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
starting from the time we get the mice?

302
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do

303
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
to actually how much people want it?

304
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
And it seems to me that the first question

305
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
is entirely a biology question,

306
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
and it's extremely hard to answer.

307
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
One has to be very speculative,

308
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,

309
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,820
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.

310
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I say that's nonsense.

311
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.

312
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,

313
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
in order to give people a sense of proportion

314
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
so that they can assess their priorities.

315
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance

316
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
of reaching this RHR milestone,

317
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point

318
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.

319
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
15 years from the robust mouse.

320
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.

321
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.

322
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
So they'll probably think it's five years away.

323
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.

324
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say

325
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,820
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now

326
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
That will be history at this point,

328
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,

329
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.

330
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,820
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,

331
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
and of course that has enormous implications.

332
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,

333
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.

334
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm going to use this word "damage"

335
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,820
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism

336
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and that eventually cause pathology.

337
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Because the critical thing about this

338
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,

339
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,820
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.

340
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
But it is not part of metabolism itself.

341
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And this turns out to be useful.

342
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.

343
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics

344
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate

345
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
at which metabolism lays down this damage.

346
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is

347
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
in concrete biological terms in a moment.

348
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time

349
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
by stopping the damage converting into pathology.

350
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
And the reason it's a losing battle

351
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.

352
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.

353
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
We can call it the "engineering approach,"

354
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.

355
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.

356
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
It does not intervene in this process or this one.

357
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,

358
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,

359
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.

360
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
The engineering approach simply says,

361
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --

362
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,820
not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,

363
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold

364
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."

365
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
We know that this threshold exists,

366
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,

367
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.

368
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.

369
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.

370
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,

371
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
is important for aging in one way or another.

373
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.

374
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
The list on the right is also incomplete.

375
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,

376
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and it's just an incomplete list.

377
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --

378
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,

379
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,

380
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
or that might cause pathology.

381
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
And there are only seven of them.

382
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.

383
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.

384
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,820
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.

385
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Of course one can make a biological argument.

386
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"

387
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.

388
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
What can damage accumulate in?

389
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
The answer is: long-lived molecules,

390
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --

391
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,820
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.

392
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
It's got to be long-lived molecules.

393
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago

394
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,820
and that is pretty good news, because it means that,

395
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,

396
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
so the fact that we haven't extended this list

397
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.

398
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,

399
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,

400
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,820
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.

401
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.

402
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but

403
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,820
my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,

404
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,820
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,

405
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
but we do need to get serious about it.

406
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
We do need to really start trying.

407
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,

408
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.

409
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,

410
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.

411
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
I've published a great deal on this;

412
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,

413
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
and there's quite a lot of detail there.

414
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
The detail is what makes me confident

415
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.

416
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
So if you think that I'm wrong,

417
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.

418
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people

419
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
who call themselves gerontologists because,

420
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,

421
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,820
you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant

422
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
and not really to take it seriously.

423
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,

424
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
in order to understand whether this is true.

425
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
And we'll just end with a few things.

426
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session

427
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,

428
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."

429
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
And you know what happened.

430
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,820
So, you know, this does happen.

431
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,

432
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
which is basically an incentive to innovate,

433
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
and to do what you think is going to work,

434
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
and you get money for it if you win.

435
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.

436
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
This is what's going to take a bit of money.

437
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,820
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?

438
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Not very long. OK.

439
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
(Laughter)

440
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,820
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,

441
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,820
but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.

442
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.

443
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Thank you.

444
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,820
(Applause)

445
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions

446
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
but I thought I would give people the chance.

447
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,

448
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,820
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?

449
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
(Laughter)

450
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.

451
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
(Laughter)

452
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,820
(Applause)

453
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems

454
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,820
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.

455
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,820
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,

456
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,820
so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.

457
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,820
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,

458
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,820
when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?

459
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question

460
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.

461
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,

462
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
which I happen to agree with,

463
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;

464
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.

465
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,820
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;

466
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes

467
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
in order to age more slowly,

468
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.

469
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,820
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,

470
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,

471
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
living a long time or by procreation,

472
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
there's a certain amount of modulation of that,

473
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,820
which is why different species have different lifespans,

474
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
but that's why there are no immortal species.

475
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
CA: The genes don't care but we do?

476
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
AG: That's right.

477
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,

478
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,820
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.

479
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,820
If I project that, that would make me think

480
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,820
that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.

481
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,820
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?

482
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.

483
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
(Laughter)

484
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Your numbers are a bit out.

485
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,820
The standard numbers are that lifespans

486
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820
have been growing at between one and two years per decade.

487
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,820
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.

488
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.

489
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults

490
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
are actually in the human embryo,

491
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.

492
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
If that is indeed true,

493
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,820
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?

494
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,820
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,

495
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?

496
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
AG: There are technical implications certainly.

497
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,820
Basically what we need to do is replace cells

498
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,

499
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them

500
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,

501
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,820
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.

502
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,820
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on

503
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
was a little bit of an oversimplification.

504
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,820
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --

505
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
but they do it by not having a nervous system --
