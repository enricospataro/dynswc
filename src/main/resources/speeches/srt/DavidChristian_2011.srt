1
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,820
First, a video.

2
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:24,019
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.

3
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:27,304
But as you look at it,

4
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:31,439
I hope you'll begin to feel
just slightly uneasy.

5
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:36,547
Because you may notice
that what's actually happening

6
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,796
is that the egg is unscrambling itself.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,519
And you'll now see the yolk
and the white have separated.

8
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:44,566
And now they're going to be
poured back into the egg.

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,058
And we all know in our heart of hearts

10
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:50,097
that this is not the way
the universe works.

11
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:54,361
A scrambled egg is mush --
tasty mush -- but it's mush.

12
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:56,796
An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,059
that can create even more
sophisticated things,

14
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,400
such as chickens.

15
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:02,796
And we know in our heart of hearts

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,584
that the universe does not travel
from mush to complexity.

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,405
In fact, this gut instinct

18
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:12,301
is reflected in one of the most
fundamental laws of physics,

19
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:15,150
the second law of thermodynamics,
or the law of entropy.

20
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,481
What that says basically

21
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:20,632
is that the general
tendency of the universe

22
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:24,259
is to move from order and structure

23
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,947
to lack of order, lack of structure --

24
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,435
in fact, to mush.

25
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,682
And that's why that video
feels a bit strange.

26
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,974
And yet, look around us.

27
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:39,490
What we see around us
is staggering complexity.

28
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,398
Eric Beinhocker estimates
that in New York City alone,

29
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:46,976
there are some 10 billion SKUs,
or distinct commodities, being traded.

30
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:51,460
That's hundreds of times
as many species as there are on Earth.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,796
And they're being traded by a species
of almost seven billion individuals,

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,205
who are linked by trade,
travel, and the Internet

33
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,918
into a global system
of stupendous complexity.

34
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:05,862
So here's a great puzzle:

35
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,398
in a universe ruled
by the second law of thermodynamics,

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,226
how is it possible

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,796
to generate the sort
of complexity I've described,

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,608
the sort of complexity
represented by you and me

39
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,321
and the convention center?

40
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,632
Well, the answer seems to be,

41
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:27,796
the universe can create complexity,

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,375
but with great difficulty.

43
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,527
In pockets,

44
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,868
there appear
what my colleague, Fred Spier,

45
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,034
calls "Goldilocks conditions" --

46
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:38,109
not too hot, not too cold,

47
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,796
just right for the creation of complexity.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,087
And slightly more complex things appear.

49
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,350
And where you have
slightly more complex things,

50
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,746
you can get slightly more complex things.

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,796
And in this way, complexity
builds stage by stage.

52
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,973
Each stage is magical

53
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:58,570
because it creates the impression
of something utterly new

54
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:01,397
appearing almost out of nowhere
in the universe.

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,652
We refer in big history to these moments
as threshold moments.

56
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:08,796
And at each threshold,
the going gets tougher.

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,062
The complex things get more fragile,

58
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,796
more vulnerable;

59
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,351
the Goldilocks conditions
get more stringent,

60
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,362
and it's more difficult
to create complexity.

61
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:24,592
Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,

62
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,796
desperately need to know this story

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,478
of how the universe creates complexity
despite the second law,

64
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:36,534
and why complexity means
vulnerability and fragility.

65
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:40,225
And that's the story
that we tell in big history.

66
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:41,956
But to do it, you have do something

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,685
that may, at first sight,
seem completely impossible.

68
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,889
You have to survey the whole
history of the universe.

69
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:50,308
So let's do it.

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,729
(Laughter)

71
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:56,199
Let's begin by winding the timeline back

72
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:59,119
13.7 billion years,

73
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:01,820
to the beginning of time.

74
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,795
Around us, there's nothing.

75
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:14,252
There's not even time or space.

76
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:18,732
Imagine the darkest,
emptiest thing you can

77
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:22,073
and cube it a gazillion times
and that's where we are.

78
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,892
And then suddenly,

79
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,924
bang!

80
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,155
A universe appears, an entire universe.

81
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,035
And we've crossed our first threshold.

82
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:32,432
The universe is tiny;
it's smaller than an atom.

83
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,796
It's incredibly hot.

84
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,345
It contains everything
that's in today's universe,

85
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,163
so you can imagine, it's busting.

86
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:40,796
And it's expanding at incredible speed.

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,733
And at first, it's just a blur,

88
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:45,867
but very quickly distinct things
begin to appear in that blur.

89
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,796
Within the first second,

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,796
energy itself shatters
into distinct forces

91
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,902
including electromagnetism and gravity.

92
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,354
And energy does something
else quite magical:

93
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,610
it congeals to form matter --

94
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,964
quarks that will create protons

95
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:04,126
and leptons that include electrons.

96
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,253
And all of that happens
in the first second.

97
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:10,506
Now we move forward 380,000 years.

98
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,467
That's twice as long as humans
have been on this planet.

99
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:19,231
And now simple atoms appear
of hydrogen and helium.

100
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,040
Now I want to pause for a moment,

101
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:24,796
380,000 years after the origins
of the universe,

102
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,796
because we actually know quite a lot
about the universe at this stage.

103
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,254
We know above all
that it was extremely simple.

104
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:36,077
It consisted of huge clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms,

105
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,029
and they have no structure.

106
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:40,420
They're really a sort of cosmic mush.

107
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,882
But that's not completely true.

108
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,796
Recent studies

109
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,681
by satellites such as the WMAP satellite

110
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,282
have shown that, in fact,

111
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,055
there are just tiny differences
in that background.

112
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,796
What you see here,

113
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,126
the blue areas are about a thousandth
of a degree cooler

114
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,542
than the red areas.

115
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,939
These are tiny differences,

116
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:03,233
but it was enough
for the universe to move on

117
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,232
to the next stage of building complexity.

118
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,448
And this is how it works.

119
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:11,703
Gravity is more powerful
where there's more stuff.

120
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:14,695
So where you get slightly denser areas,

121
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:18,636
gravity starts compacting clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms.

122
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,210
So we can imagine the early universe
breaking up into a billion clouds.

123
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,036
And each cloud is compacted,

124
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,076
gravity gets more powerful
as density increases,

125
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,194
the temperature begins to rise
at the center of each cloud,

126
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:31,507
and then, at the center,

127
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:34,369
the temperature crosses
the threshold temperature

128
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,959
of 10 million degrees,

129
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,388
protons start to fuse,

130
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,796
there's a huge release of energy,

131
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,253
and --

132
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,293
bam!

133
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,832
We have our first stars.

134
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:49,356
From about 200 million years
after the Big Bang,

135
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,787
stars begin to appear
all through the universe,

136
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,882
billions of them.

137
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,175
And the universe is now
significantly more interesting

138
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,294
and more complex.

139
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:02,864
Stars will create
the Goldilocks conditions

140
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,787
for crossing two new thresholds.

141
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,770
When very large stars die,

142
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,115
they create temperatures so high

143
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,772
that protons begin to fuse
in all sorts of exotic combinations,

144
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:16,626
to form all the elements
of the periodic table.

145
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,946
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,

146
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,796
it was forged in a supernova explosion.

147
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:25,637
So now the universe
is chemically more complex.

148
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:28,026
And in a chemically more complex universe,

149
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,494
it's possible to make more things.

150
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:34,010
And what starts happening
is that, around young suns,

151
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,796
young stars,

152
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,011
all these elements combine,
they swirl around,

153
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:40,815
the energy of the star stirs them around,

154
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:45,564
they form particles, they form snowflakes,
they form little dust motes,

155
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:47,784
they form rocks, they form asteroids,

156
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,403
and eventually,
they form planets and moons.

157
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:53,377
And that is how our
solar system was formed,

158
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,796
four and a half billion years ago.

159
00:07:57,013 --> 00:08:02,386
Rocky planets like our Earth
are significantly more complex than stars

160
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,172
because they contain
a much greater diversity of materials.

161
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:07,977
So we've crossed a fourth
threshold of complexity.

162
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:12,118
Now, the going gets tougher.

163
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:17,249
The next stage introduces entities
that are significantly more fragile,

164
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,185
significantly more vulnerable,

165
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,796
but they're also much more creative

166
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,796
and much more capable
of generating further complexity.

167
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,590
I'm talking, of course,
about living organisms.

168
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:31,437
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

169
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,844
We are huge packages of chemicals.

170
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,796
So, chemistry is dominated
by the electromagnetic force.

171
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,059
That operates over smaller
scales than gravity,

172
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,998
which explains why you and I
are smaller than stars or planets.

173
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,887
Now, what are the ideal
conditions for chemistry?

174
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,204
What are the Goldilocks conditions?

175
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,585
Well, first, you need energy,

176
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:52,796
but not too much.

177
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,480
In the center of a star,
there's so much energy

178
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:58,646
that any atoms that combine
will just get busted apart again.

179
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,796
But not too little.

180
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,433
In intergalactic space,

181
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,340
there's so little energy
that atoms can't combine.

182
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,796
What you want is just the right amount,

183
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
and planets, it turns out, are just right,

184
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:11,351
because they're close to stars,
but not too close.

185
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:15,549
You also need a great diversity
of chemical elements,

186
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:18,581
and you need liquids, such as water.

187
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:19,652
Why?

188
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:23,548
Well, in gases, atoms move
past each other so fast

189
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:25,025
that they can't hitch up.

190
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,232
In solids,

191
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,796
atoms are stuck together, they can't move.

192
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,538
In liquids,

193
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,600
they can cruise and cuddle

194
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,926
and link up to form molecules.

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,955
Now, where do you find
such Goldilocks conditions?

196
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,486
Well, planets are great,

197
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,796
and our early Earth was almost perfect.

198
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:48,645
It was just the right
distance from its star

199
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,796
to contain huge oceans of liquid water.

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,796
And deep beneath those oceans,

201
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,796
at cracks in the Earth's crust,

202
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,796
you've got heat seeping up
from inside the Earth,

203
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,947
and you've got a great
diversity of elements.

204
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,517
So at those deep oceanic vents,

205
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,796
fantastic chemistry began to happen,

206
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
and atoms combined in all sorts
of exotic combinations.

207
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,185
But of course, life is more
than just exotic chemistry.

208
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:17,371
How do you stabilize those huge molecules

209
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:18,752
that seem to be viable?

210
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,866
Well, it's here that life introduces
an entirely new trick.

211
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,315
You don't stabilize the individual;

212
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,442
you stabilize the template,

213
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,571
the thing that carries information,

214
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:33,812
and you allow the template to copy itself.

215
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,987
And DNA, of course,
is the beautiful molecule

216
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,337
that contains that information.

217
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,176
You'll be familiar
with the double helix of DNA.

218
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,716
Each rung contains information.

219
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,313
So, DNA contains information
about how to make living organisms.

220
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,799
And DNA also copies itself.

221
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,029
So, it copies itself

222
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,735
and scatters the templates
through the ocean.

223
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,553
So the information spreads.

224
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:00,215
Notice that information
has become part of our story.

225
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:04,342
The real beauty of DNA though
is in its imperfections.

226
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:08,294
As it copies itself,
once in every billion rungs,

227
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,063
there tends to be an error.

228
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:14,796
And what that means
is that DNA is, in effect, learning.

229
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,140
It's accumulating new ways
of making living organisms

230
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:19,784
because some of those errors work.

231
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,006
So DNA's learning

232
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,264
and it's building greater
diversity and greater complexity.

233
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:27,470
And we can see this happening
over the last four billion years.

234
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,669
For most of that time of life on Earth,

235
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,930
living organisms have been
relatively simple --

236
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,342
single cells.

237
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:36,796
But they had great diversity,
and, inside, great complexity.

238
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,135
Then from about 600
to 800 million years ago,

239
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,250
multi-celled organisms appear.

240
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:44,775
You get fungi, you get fish,

241
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,314
you get plants,

242
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,049
you get amphibia, you get reptiles,

243
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,503
and then, of course,
you get the dinosaurs.

244
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,068
And occasionally, there are disasters.

245
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:58,535
Sixty-five million years ago,

246
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,523
an asteroid landed on Earth

247
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,337
near the Yucatan Peninsula,

248
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,329
creating conditions equivalent
to those of a nuclear war,

249
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,242
and the dinosaurs were wiped out.

250
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,796
Terrible news for the dinosaurs,

251
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,575
but great news
for our mammalian ancestors,

252
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,796
who flourished

253
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,477
in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.

254
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:24,556
And we human beings are part
of that creative evolutionary pulse

255
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,916
that began 65 million years ago

256
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,820
with the landing of an asteroid.

257
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:33,070
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.

258
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:37,442
And I believe we count
as a threshold in this great story.

259
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,673
Let me explain why.

260
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,291
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,

261
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:44,102
it accumulates information.

262
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,796
But it is so slow.

263
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:50,160
DNA accumulates information
through random errors,

264
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:52,320
some of which just happen to work.

265
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,684
But DNA had actually generated
a faster way of learning:

266
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,486
it had produced organisms with brains,

267
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,729
and those organisms
can learn in real time.

268
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,079
They accumulate information, they learn.

269
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,928
The sad thing is, when they die,

270
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,650
the information dies with them.

271
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,026
Now what makes humans different
is human language.

272
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,813
We are blessed with a language,
a system of communication,

273
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,458
so powerful and so precise

274
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:21,640
that we can share what we've learned
with such precision

275
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:24,553
that it can accumulate
in the collective memory.

276
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:25,796
And that means

277
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,599
it can outlast the individuals
who learned that information,

278
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,796
and it can accumulate
from generation to generation.

279
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,876
And that's why, as a species,
we're so creative and so powerful,

280
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,956
and that's why we have a history.

281
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:42,876
We seem to be the only species
in four billion years

282
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,142
to have this gift.

283
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:48,182
I call this ability collective learning.

284
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:49,944
It's what makes us different.

285
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,796
We can see it at work
in the earliest stages of human history.

286
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,796
We evolved as a species
in the savanna lands of Africa,

287
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,280
but then you see humans migrating
into new environments,

288
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,454
into desert lands, into jungles,

289
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,914
into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --

290
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,383
tough, tough environment --

291
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,740
into the Americas, into Australasia.

292
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:11,801
Each migration involved learning --

293
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,308
learning new ways of exploiting
the environment,

294
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,506
new ways of dealing
with their surroundings.

295
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,346
Then 10,000 years ago,

296
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,365
exploiting a sudden
change in global climate

297
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,961
with the end of the last ice age,

298
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,566
humans learned to farm.

299
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:27,619
Farming was an energy bonanza.

300
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:31,470
And exploiting that energy,
human populations multiplied.

301
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:35,081
Human societies got larger,
denser, more interconnected.

302
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,012
And then from about 500 years ago,

303
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,075
humans began to link up globally

304
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,480
through shipping, through trains,

305
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,796
through telegraph, through the Internet,

306
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,011
until now we seem to form
a single global brain

307
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:53,167
of almost seven billion individuals.

308
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:56,353
And that brain is learning at warp speed.

309
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,704
And in the last 200 years,
something else has happened.

310
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:02,394
We've stumbled on another energy bonanza

311
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:03,545
in fossil fuels.

312
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,272
So fossil fuels and collective
learning together

313
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,820
explain the staggering complexity
we see around us.

314
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:14,065
So --

315
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:16,545
Here we are,

316
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:18,093
back at the convention center.

317
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:22,823
We've been on a journey,
a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.

318
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,996
I hope you agree this is a powerful story.

319
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,685
And it's a story in which humans
play an astonishing and creative role.

320
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,241
But it also contains warnings.

321
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:38,367
Collective learning is a very,
very powerful force,

322
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:42,796
and it's not clear
that we humans are in charge of it.

323
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,752
I remember very vividly
as a child growing up in England,

324
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,796
living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.

325
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:53,018
For a few days, the entire biosphere

326
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,341
seemed to be on the verge of destruction.

327
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:59,199
And the same weapons are still here,

328
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:00,796
and they are still armed.

329
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:04,796
If we avoid that trap,
others are waiting for us.

330
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,796
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate

331
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,231
that we seem to be undermining
the Goldilocks conditions

332
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:13,483
that made it possible
for human civilizations

333
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:16,589
to flourish over the last 10,000 years.

334
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,469
So what big history can do

335
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:22,814
is show us the nature
of our complexity and fragility

336
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,762
and the dangers that face us,

337
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:28,366
but it can also show us
our power with collective learning.

338
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:31,098
And now, finally --

339
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,372
this is what I want.

340
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:39,040
I want my grandson, Daniel,

341
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,821
and his friends and his generation,

342
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,638
throughout the world,

343
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:46,502
to know the story of big history,

344
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,565
and to know it so well

345
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:52,255
that they understand
both the challenges that face us

346
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,796
and the opportunities that face us.

347
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,700
And that's why a group of us

348
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,736
are building a free, online syllabus

349
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,078
in big history

350
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,253
for high-school students
throughout the world.

351
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,221
We believe that big history

352
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,796
will be a vital
intellectual tool for them,

353
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,663
as Daniel and his generation

354
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:14,035
