1
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,461
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"

2
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,341
and when I worked on this film, I discovered something

3
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,804
about how our brains work, and how our brains work

4
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,083
is that, when we're sort of infused with

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,329
either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,

6
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,737
it changes and alters our perception of things.

7
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,914
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.

8
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,422
And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create

9
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:37,342
a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch

10
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:40,764
for this particular movie, because I put it out there,

11
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:42,821
I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment

12
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:46,429
and bring a group of people like this in a projection room

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,109
and play this stock footage, and when I played this

14
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,910
stock footage, I simply wanted to find out

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,325
what people remembered, what was memorable about it?

16
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,328
What should I actually try to replicate?

17
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:01,099
What should I try to emulate to some degree?

18
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:04,188
So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.

19
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,870
And what I discovered is, because of the nature

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,068
of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,

21
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,021
there was an emotion that was built into it

22
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:14,099
and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us

23
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,773
and all these various things.

24
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:17,805
When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after

25
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,596
the screening was over, what they thought of it,

26
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:23,062
what was your memorable shots, they changed them.

27
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:25,440
They were -- had camera moves on them.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,116
They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,

29
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:31,098
and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell

30
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:32,465
were you looking at just a few minutes ago

31
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:36,309
and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?

32
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:40,157
And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually

33
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:43,847
replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.

34
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:47,829
So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,

35
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,537
taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then

36
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,979
the combination of all the different shots and all

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,907
the different things put together created their sort of

38
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,946
collective consciousness of what they remembered

39
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,596
it looked like, but not what it really looked like.

40
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:01,594
So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."

41
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:06,061
(Launch noises)

42
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,827
So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence

43
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,888
of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,

44
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:14,186
including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty

45
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:15,910
with the subject matter.

46
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,547
I basically shot everything with short lenses,

47
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,464
which means that you're very close to the action,

48
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:22,754
but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots

49
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,394
which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically

50
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,378
was setting up something that would remind you

51
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,850
of something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)

52
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,381
And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is

53
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,982
that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

54
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:49,877
(Music)

55
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,007
Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

56
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,798
It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)

57
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:57,238
Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.

58
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:59,396
(Laughter)

59
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,801
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,

60
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,626
and I'm basically recreating the launch with

61
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:08,965
fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw

62
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:12,310
in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically

63
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,127
if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,

64
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,308
what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,

65
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:20,743
is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that

66
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,137
really kind of fascinating.

67
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:25,113
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,

68
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:28,322
and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply

69
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:31,892
take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.

70
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:33,895
And that's simply what I did.

71
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,372
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,

72
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:39,911
so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,

73
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,743
you know, following the rocket all the way down,

74
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:44,422
and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately

75
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,922
trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.

76
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:50,519
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,

77
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,524
who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,

78
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,043
and he was there to basically double check my science.

79
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:00,564
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.

80
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,296
(Laughter)

81
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,884
I don't know why, but they thought they did.

82
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:09,026
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and

83
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,832
we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself

84
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,303
the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did

85
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,712
didn't really suck that bad.

86
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:19,972
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little

87
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,429
good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed

88
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,966
to really check and see what we were doing,

89
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,952
and basically give us our A plus report card,

90
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,917
and so I showed him some shots we were working on,

91
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:33,027
and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,

92
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:36,116
which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)

93
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,155
So I showed him these two shots,

94
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:41,572
and then he basically told me what he thought.

95
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,109
("That's wrong") (Laughter)

96
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:47,068
Okay. (Laughter)

97
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,992
It's what you dream about.

98
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:51,992
(Laughter)

99
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,499
So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,

100
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:58,953
"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.

101
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,202
You would never have a rocket go up

102
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:02,263
while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine

103
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:04,318
the tragedy that could possibly happen with that?

104
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:07,160
You would never, ever design a rocket like that."

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,307
And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know

106
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,317
if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot

107
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,245
recreating one of America's finest moments with

108
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,904
fire extinguishers.

109
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:17,263
(Laughter)

110
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:20,191
And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,

111
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,468
a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --

112
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,167
(Laughter)

113
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,204
I'm just going to show you some footage.

114
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,814
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.

115
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:31,237
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.

116
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,276
So I showed him this, and this is actual footage

117
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:36,821
that he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.

118
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:42,097
So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.

119
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:44,881
("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)

120
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:48,115
So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned

121
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,597
in that is that he remembered it differently.

122
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,941
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry

123
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:55,644
system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting

124
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,867
in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds

125
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,141
of thrust, built by the lowest bidder.

126
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,396
He was hoping it was going to work out okay.

127
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,165
(Laughter) (Applause)

128
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,309
So he twisted his memory around.

129
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:10,383
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not

130
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,698
on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking

131
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,924
any of this footage, and he just responded

132
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,754
as he would respond, and I'll run this.

133
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,188
Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me

134
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:24,626
and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots

135
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:29,624
I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find

136
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:32,085
that stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,

137
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,503
we generated all that from scratch."

138
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:39,407
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"

139
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:42,863
(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)

140
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,790
RL: I think he's a great American.

141
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,571
(Laughter)

142
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:51,874
So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,

143
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,614
doesn't end well.

144
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,395
(Laughter)

145
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,546
Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.

146
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:01,827
So he basically set up, or basically shattered

147
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,230
the suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed

148
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,657
was the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually

149
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:10,000
two Mir subs going down to the real wreck,

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,037
and he created this very haunting footage.

151
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:14,910
It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these

152
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,104
various different emotions, but he couldn't photograph

153
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,833
everything, and to tell the story,

154
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,683
I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,

155
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,244
because now I have to recreate back to back

156
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,299
what really happened and I had, I'm the only one

157
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:31,574
who could really blow it at that point.

158
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,614
So this is the footage he photographed,

159
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:38,258
and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.

160
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,755
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb

161
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,956
this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions

162
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:46,633
when I was looking at it for the very first time.

163
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,199
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically

164
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,584
see it come back to life.

165
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:55,305
I automatically wanted to see this ship,

166
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:57,968
this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,

167
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,044
and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,

168
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,492
basically go back to what it looks like.

169
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:06,952
So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you

170
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:09,357
what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,

171
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:12,956
for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,

172
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:16,552
that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.

173
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,533
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found

174
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,820
interesting is what we really were emoting to

175
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,238
when you take a look at it.

176
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,144
So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.

177
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:27,107
So, when you saw my footage,

178
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,750
you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys

179
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,747
flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs

180
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,352
are actually about the size of small footballs,

181
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:37,385
and shot in smoke.

182
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,595
Jim went three miles went down, and I went about

183
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,193
three miles away from the studio

184
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,793
and photographed this in a garage.

185
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:46,024
And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking

186
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,136
at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,

187
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,377
that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating

188
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:56,869
that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,

189
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,676
you transfer everything that you feel about it,

190
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,068
this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.

191
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:05,800
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,

192
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
and I found that that was a very interesting thing

193
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,595
to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next

194
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,390
effect that I'll show you, which is

195
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,605
this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting

196
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:19,558
to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,

197
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,210
so it became a seamless experience for them,

198
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,540
that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,

199
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,461
I was showing you what you wanted to see.

200
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:34,244
And the very next shot, right after this --

201
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,809
So you can see what I was doing.

202
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,603
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,

203
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,511
I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?

204
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,072
And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,

205
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,343
because he was photographing from the other,

206
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,047
and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.

207
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:48,417
I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.

208
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:54,735
(Laughter)

209
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:57,074
Okay. So now the Titanic transition.

210
00:09:57,074 --> 00:10:00,225
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically

211
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,142
magically transplant from one state of the Titanic

212
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:07,090
to the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)

213
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,530
(Music)

214
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:16,282
And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.

215
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:26,115
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

216
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:28,904
RL: So, what I did is basically I had another

217
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:31,742
screening room experience where I was basically tracking

218
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,044
where I was looking, or where we were looking,

219
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:36,462
and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow

220
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,655
of the ship, and then at some point,

221
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,673
I'm changing the periphery of the shot,

222
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,995
I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,

223
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:46,004
and then I would run it every day, and then I would find

224
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:49,071
exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them

225
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,261
and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment

226
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,819
my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.

227
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,195
The moment my eye shifted, I immediately started

228
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,534
to change them, so now somehow you missed

229
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,874
where it started and where it stopped.

230
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:03,027
And so I'll just show it one more time.

231
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:06,224
(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains

232
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:09,959
naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift

233
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,911
your attention, something changes, and then I left

234
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,054
the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be

235
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:17,907
a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still

236
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:21,237
on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.

237
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:23,246
Or something like that. I just made that up.

238
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:25,715
(Laughter)

239
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,599
It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.

240
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:31,070
It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)

241
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,352
Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because

242
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,462
the movie itself is about film illusions.

243
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,327
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence

244
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:41,145
of vision that creates a motion picture,

245
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,819
and one of the things I had to do is, we —

246
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,146
Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,

247
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:50,297
comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of

248
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,525
the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted

249
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,833
his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.

250
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,954
Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly

251
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:01,279
on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually

252
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,143
move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.

253
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,606
So let me show you the scene, and then I basically

254
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:12,289
used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,

255
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:15,463
which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving

256
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,232
object, what is not moving appears to be moving,

257
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:20,831
and what is moving appears to be stopped,

258
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,746
so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not

259
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:28,826
moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.

260
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:31,857
So this is the shot. That's a little video of

261
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:35,139
what you're looking at there, which is our little test,

262
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,718
so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was

263
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,875
sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part

264
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,200
of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this

265
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,718
sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.

266
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:48,383
I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented

267
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:53,028
like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,

268
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,684
and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's

269
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:57,065
really hard to really get until you actually see it work,

270
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,945
and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,

271
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,167
"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?

272
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,120
That doesn't move."

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,538
(Laughter) (Applause)

274
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,514
"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."

275
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,989
Precisely. (Laughter)

276
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:16,784
Brings me to the next, and final --

277
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:20,853
Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)

278
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:24,643
This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)

279
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:29,070
The next illustration is something that, there's like

280
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,132
all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,

281
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,189
especially if you're following somebody on a journey,

282
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,497
and that journey basically tells something about

283
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:38,738
their personality in a very concise way,

284
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:41,121
and what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"

285
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,005
which is one of the great shots ever,

286
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,382
a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill

287
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,518
through what it feels like to be a gangster walk

288
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:51,081
going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.

289
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,588
He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo

290
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,244
to feel the same way, so we created this shot.

291
00:13:57,244 --> 00:14:00,561
(Music)

292
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:05,587
That's Hugo. (Music)

293
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:08,664
And we felt that if we could basically move the camera

294
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,354
with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy

295
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:14,145
who is basically the master of his universe,

296
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,604
and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes

297
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,245
in the bowels of this particular train station

298
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:21,549
that only he can actually navigate through

299
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:23,848
and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that

300
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:26,155
this is his normal, everyday sort of life,

301
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,721
so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,

302
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,337
and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically

303
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,348
it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,

304
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:38,870
so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,

305
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,136
and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got

306
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:43,698
when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.

307
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:47,499
So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.

308
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:50,684
It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times

309
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:51,871
with two different boys.

310
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,033
The one on the left is where the shot ends,

311
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:59,459
and the shot on the right is where it takes over,

312
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,964
and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,

313
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:06,838
who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)

314
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,687
I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig

315
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,151
that we built for this. (Music)

316
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,702
And so this is, and now this is set number three

317
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:19,082
we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically

318
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,746
the very last moment of the shot is actually

319
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,028
the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes

320
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,073
and various things like that, and it literally was done

321
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,370
over five different sets, two different boys, different times,

322
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,200
and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was

323
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,895
sort of great for me was it was probably

324
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,412
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,

325
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:42,000
and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,898
which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.

327
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,708
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,

328
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,632
and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of

329
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:53,504
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.

330
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,415
What do you think was the reason?"

331
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,825
And he said, "Because no one knows

332
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:59,791
you had anything to do with it."

333
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,597
(Laughter)

334
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:06,511
So, all I can say is, thank you,

335
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:11,711
and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)

336
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:17,055
(Applause)
