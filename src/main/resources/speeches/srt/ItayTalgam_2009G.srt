1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,820
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,820
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
And I go on the podium.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
You know, this little office of the conductor.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
with a lot of space.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
And in front of all that noise,

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
you do a very small gesture.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
Noise becomes music.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
to think that it's all about me.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
(Laughter)

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
All those great people here, virtuosos,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
they make noise, they need me to do that.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Not really. If it were that,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I would just save you the talk,

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
and teach you the gesture.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
So you could go out to the world

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
Let's look at the first video.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,820
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,820
(Music)

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Was that nice?

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
So that was a sort of a success.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Now, who should we thank for the success?

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
playing beautifully,

33
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,820
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
They don't often even look at the conductor.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
actually taking part in doing the music.

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,820
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,820
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast

39
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
that you will ever get in Vienna.

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,820
(Laughter)

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
(Laughter)

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
So that's a sort of a tradition.

47
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
But Viennese audiences do not do that.

48
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,820
Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
You know, audiences like you, yeah,

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
make the event.

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
But what about the conductor? What can you say

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,820
the conductor was doing, actually?

54
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
Um, he was happy.

55
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
And I often show this to senior management.

56
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
People get annoyed.

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"

58
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
does not come from

61
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
only his own story and his joy of the music.

62
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
The joy is about enabling other people's stories

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
to be heard at the same time.

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,820
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
You have the stories of the individuals

67
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
in the orchestra and in the audience.

68
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
And then you have other stories, unseen.

69
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
People who build this wonderful concert hall.

70
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,820
People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.

71
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
And all those stories are being heard at the same time.

72
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
This is the true experience of a live concert.

73
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
And not all conductors do just that.

75
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.

76
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Riccardo Muti, please.

77
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,820
(Music)

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Yeah, that was very short, but you could see

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
it's a completely different figure. Right?

80
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,820
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.

82
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?

84
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.

85
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Okay? Ready?

86
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫

87
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Itay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me

88
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
I feel even more redundant than I already feel.

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
So please, wait for the conductor.

90
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.

91
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
(Laughter)

93
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,820
(Laughter)

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...

96
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,820
But -- (Laughter)

97
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.

98
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...

99
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
(Laughter)

100
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
And then -- sort of -- (Laughter)

101
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
So not only the instruction is clear,

102
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.

103
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
(Laughter)

104
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
So, does it work? Yes, it works --

105
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
to a certain point.

106
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"

107
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
He says, "I'm responsible."

108
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Responsible in front of him.

109
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,

110
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.

111
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,820
(Laughter)

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
So he says, "If I'm --

113
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
(Applause)

114
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
if I'm responsible for Mozart,

115
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
this is going to be the only story to be told.

116
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And you know what happened to Muti?

118
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Three years ago he got a letter signed by

119
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
all 700 employees of La Scala,

120
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
musical employees, I mean the musicians,

121
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,820
saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."

122
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
(Laughter)

123
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
"Why? Because you don't let us develop.

124
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.

125
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."

126
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?

127
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
(Laughter)

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.

129
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Well, can you do it with less control,

130
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
or with a different kind of control?

131
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.

132
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,820
(Music)

133
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
It's not true. When he was a young man

135
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
of about 30, he wrote what he called

136
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."

137
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert

138
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
it means that you must have done something wrong.

139
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.

140
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
It says: Never look at the trombones --

141
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
it only encourages them.

142
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,820
(Laughter)

143
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
So, the whole idea is really to let

144
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
it happen by itself.

145
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Do not interfere.

146
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
But how does it happen? Did you see

147
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
him turning pages in the score?

148
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Now, either he is senile,

149
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.

150
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,

151
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,820
"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
So it's not about my story. It's not about your story.

153
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
It's only the execution of the written music,

154
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
no interpretation."

155
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Interpretation is the real story of the performer.

156
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.

157
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Let's see another super-conductor,

158
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.

159
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
(Music)

160
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.

161
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Did you see the hands?

162
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.

163
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.

164
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?

165
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...

166
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.

167
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Audience: (Claps)

168
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.

169
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Audience: (Claps)

170
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,

171
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.

172
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)

173
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)

174
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Because you didn't know when to play.

175
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic

176
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
doesn't know when to play.

177
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
(Laughter)

178
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
This is a German orchestra, yes?

180
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,820
They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.

181
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
(Laughter)

182
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
"Do you understand what this guy wants?"

183
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
And after doing that,

184
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra

185
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
lead the whole ensemble in playing together.

186
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
And when Karajan is asked about it

187
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage

188
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
I can do to my orchestra

189
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
is to give them a clear instruction.

190
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Because that would

191
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other

192
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
that is needed for an orchestra."

193
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Now that's great. What about the eyes?

194
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Why are the eyes closed?

195
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,820
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.

196
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
And he cues in a flute player like this.

197
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)

198
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?

200
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."

201
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
(Laughter)

202
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.

203
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.

204
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure

205
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
because I don't give you instruction,

206
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
and yet, you have to guess my mind.

207
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet

208
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
very firm control.

209
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
to the first conductor we've seen:

211
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.

212
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,820
(Music)

213
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
(Laughter) Yeah.

214
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?

215
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.

216
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
When he does this, it's not,

217
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,

218
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
smash it on the floor." It's not that.

219
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.

220
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
I'm opening a space for you

221
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
to put in another layer

222
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
of interpretation."

223
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
That is another story.

224
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
But how does it really work together

225
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
if it doesn't give them instructions?

226
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?

227
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
You're not really given any instructions,

228
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,820
but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.

229
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
That's what he does.

230
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.

231
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,820
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.

232
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
And that's what makes them into partners.

233
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
You have the plan in your head.

234
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.

235
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
But here and there and that. You know what to do.

236
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,

237
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
yeah, with sound,

238
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
as you actually take the ride.

239
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
This is very exciting for those players.

240
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.

241
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
(Laughter)

242
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
It is very tiring. Yeah?

243
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
But it's the best music making, like this.

244
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
But of course it's not only about motivation

245
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
and giving them a lot of physical energy.

246
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You also have to be very professional.

247
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
And look again at this Kleiber.

248
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Can we have the next video, quickly?

249
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.

250
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.

251
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
(Music)

252
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
And now there is a trumpet player who

253
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
does something not exactly the way it should be done.

254
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Go along with the video. Look.

255
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,820
See, second time for the same player.

256
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.

257
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
(Laughter)

258
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
"Wait for me after the concert.

259
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
I have a short notice to give you."

260
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,820
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.

261
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
But authority is not enough to make people your partners.

262
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here.

263
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber

264
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
as such a hyperactive guy.

265
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
He's conducting Mozart.

266
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
(Music)

267
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
The whole orchestra is playing.

268
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
(Music)

269
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Now something else.

270
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
(Music)

271
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
See? He is there 100 percent,

272
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
but not commanding, not telling what to do.

273
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.

274
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
(Music)

275
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this.

276
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
(Music)

277
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Look at the eyes.

278
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Okay. You see that?

279
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.

280
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.

281
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
So that's a good thing.

282
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
And the second thing is

283
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
it's about actually being in control,

284
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
but in a very special way.

285
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,

286
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
going from here? (Singing)

287
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.

288
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Kleiber not only creates a process,

289
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
but also creates the conditions in the world

290
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
in which this process takes place.

291
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
So again, the oboe player

292
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
is completely autonomous

293
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
and therefore happy and proud of his work,

294
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
and creative and all of that.

295
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,820
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.

296
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.

297
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,

298
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,820
in partnership, brings about the best music.

299
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
So Kleiber is about process.

300
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.

301
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,820
But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.

302
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.

303
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Since he was a great teacher,

304
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.

305
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,820
(Music)

306
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?

307
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.

308
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
(Laughter)

309
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Did you see Lenny's face?

310
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,820
You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.

311
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
And you're playing a painful sound.

312
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.

313
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
But not in a way that you want to stop.

314
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,820
It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.

315
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,820
(Laughter)

316
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
But you can see the music on his face.

317
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,820
You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.

318
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Now it's about you, the player,

319
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
telling the story.

320
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.

321
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
And even briefly, you become the storyteller

322
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
to which the community, the whole community, listens to.

323
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,820
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?

324
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,

325
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
and maybe some others,

326
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.

327
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,820
And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.

328
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
My friend Peter says,

329
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,820
"If you love something, give it away." So, please.

330
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,820
(Music)

331
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:42,820
(Applause)
