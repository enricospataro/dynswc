1
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:14,446
So I'm going to talk about work,

2
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,256
specifically why people can't
seem to get work done at work,

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,709
which is a problem we all kind of have.

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,896
But let's sort of start at the beginning.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,526
So, we have companies
and non-profits and charities

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,494
and all these groups that have
employees or volunteers of some sort.

7
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:35,724
And they expect these people
who work for them

8
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,430
to do great work --

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,796
I would hope, at least.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,535
At least good work, hopefully,
at least it's good work --

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:42,796
hopefully great work.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,868
And so what they typically
do is they decide

13
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:48,796
that all these people need to come
together in one place to do that work.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,795
So a company, or a charity,
or an organization of any kind,

15
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:55,983
unless you're working in Africa,
if you're really lucky to do that --

16
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,240
most people have to go
to an office every day.

17
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,200
And so these companies,

18
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,949
they build offices.

19
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,869
They go out and they buy a building,
or they rent a building,

20
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:06,796
or they lease some space,

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,796
and they fill this space with stuff.

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,796
They fill it with tables, or desks,

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,695
chairs, computer equipment,

24
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,796
software, Internet access,

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,065
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,

26
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:24,670
and they expect their employees,
or their volunteers,

27
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:27,343
to come to that location
every day to do great work.

28
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:30,288
It seems like it's perfectly
reasonable to ask that.

29
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:32,645
However, if you actually talk to people

30
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:35,313
and even question yourself,
and you ask yourself,

31
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:38,851
where do you really want to go when you
really need to get something done?

32
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,601
You'll find out that people don't say
what businesses think they would say.

33
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,122
If you ask people the question:

34
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,962
Where do you need to go
when you need to get something done?

35
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,460
Typically, you get three different
kinds of answers.

36
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,347
One is kind of a place
or a location or a room.

37
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,315
Another one is a moving object,

38
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:56,006
and a third is a time.

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,042
So here are some examples.

40
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,297
I've been asking people this question
for about 10 years:

41
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,477
"Where do you go when you
really need to get something done?"

42
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,049
I'll hear things like, the porch,
the deck, the kitchen.

43
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:11,121
I'll hear things like
an extra room in the house,

44
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,422
the basement,

45
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,347
the coffee shop, the library.

46
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,922
And then you'll hear
things like the train,

47
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:21,046
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.

48
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,198
And then you'll hear people say,

49
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,224
"Well, it doesn't really
matter where I am,

50
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:28,760
as long as it's early in the morning
or late at night or on the weekends."

51
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,609
You almost never hear
someone say, "The office."

52
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,205
But businesses are spending all this money
on this place called the office,

53
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,483
and they're making people
go to it all the time,

54
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,542
yet people don't do work in the office.

55
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,729
What is that about?

56
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:42,213
(Laughter)

57
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:45,490
Why is that? Why is that happening?

58
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,183
And what you find out is,

59
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:50,595
if you dig a little bit deeper,
you find out that people --

60
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,269
this is what happens:

61
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,022
People go to work,

62
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:56,356
and they're basically
trading in their work day

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,872
for a series of "work moments" --
that's what happens at the office.

64
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,579
You don't have a work day anymore.
You have work moments.

65
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:05,381
It's like the front door
of the office is like a Cuisinart,

66
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,707
and you walk in and your day
is shredded to bits,

67
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:10,279
because you have 15 minutes here,
30 minutes there,

68
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,026
and something else happens,
you're pulled off your work,

69
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,939
then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,
then you have something else to do ...

70
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,773
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone
pulls you aside and asks you a question,

71
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:22,993
and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,

72
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,589
and you look back on the day,

73
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:27,644
and you realize that you
didn't get anything done.

74
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,025
We've all been through this.

75
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,852
We probably went through it yesterday
or the day before, or the day before that.

76
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,290
You look back on your day,

77
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,330
and you're like,
"I got nothing done today.

78
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:40,944
I was at work. I sat at my desk.
I used my expensive computer.

79
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,205
I used the software they told me to use.

80
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:45,682
I went to these meetings
I was asked to go to.

81
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:48,403
I did these conference calls.
I did all this stuff.

82
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:50,796
But I didn't actually do anything.

83
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,404
I just did tasks.

84
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:54,868
I didn't actually get
meaningful work done."

85
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,203
And what you find is that,
especially with creative people --

86
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:03,796
designers, programmers,
writers, engineers, thinkers --

87
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,708
that people really need long stretches
of uninterrupted time

88
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,054
to get something done.

89
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:12,506
You cannot ask somebody
to be creative in 15 minutes

90
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,149
and really think about a problem.

91
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,539
You might have a quick idea,

92
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:19,522
but to be in deep thought about a problem
and really consider a problem carefully,

93
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:21,934
you need long stretches
of uninterrupted time.

94
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,133
And even though the work day
is typically eight hours,

95
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:28,712
how many people here have ever had
eight hours to themselves at the office?

96
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,903
How about seven hours?

97
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:33,135
Six? Five? Four?

98
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,311
When's the last time you had
three hours to yourself at the office?

99
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,357
Two hours? One, maybe?

100
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,096
Very, very few people actually have

101
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,794
long stretches of uninterrupted
time at an office.

102
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:46,348
And this is why people
choose to do work at home,

103
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:47,951
or they might go to the office,

104
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,610
but they might go to the office
really early in the day,

105
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:52,460
or late at night when no one's around,

106
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,552
or they stick around
after everyone's left,

107
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,990
or go in on the weekends,

108
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:59,105
or they get work done on the plane,
in the car or in the train,

109
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,034
because there are no distractions.

110
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:03,253
Now there are different
kinds of distractions,

111
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,666
but not the really bad distractions,
which I'll talk about in a minute.

112
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,154
And this whole phenomenon of having
short bursts of time to get things done

113
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,820
reminds me of another thing
that doesn't work when you're interrupted,

114
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:16,029
and that is sleep.

115
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:19,780
I think that sleep and work
are very closely related --

116
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:23,502
not because you can work while you're
sleeping and sleep while you're working.

117
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:24,970
That's not really what I mean.

118
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:31,065
I'm talking specifically about the fact
that sleep and work are phase-based,

119
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,820
or stage-based, events.

120
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:39,199
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --
some people call them different things.

121
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:43,057
There are five of them, and in order
to get to the really deep ones,

122
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,850
the meaningful ones,
you have to go through the early ones.

123
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:49,065
If you're interrupted while you're
going through the early ones --

124
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,796
if someone bumps you in bed,
or there's a sound, or whatever happens --

125
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
you don't just pick up where you left off.

126
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,796
If you're interrupted and woken up,

127
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,558
you have to start again.

128
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,796
So you have to go back
a few phases and start again.

129
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,587
And what ends up happening --
you might have days like this

130
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,159
where you wake up at eight or seven
in the morning, or whenever you get up,

131
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:10,299
and you're like,
"I didn't sleep very well.

132
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,891
I did the sleep thing --
I went to bed, I laid down,

133
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,293
but I didn't really sleep."

134
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:17,683
People say you go "to" sleep,

135
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:20,825
but you don't go to sleep,
you go towards sleep; it takes a while.

136
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,904
You've got to go through phases and stuff,

137
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,237
and if you're interrupted,
you don't sleep well.

138
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,617
So does anyone here
expect someone to sleep well

139
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,223
if they're interrupted all night?

140
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,961
I don't think anyone would say yes.

141
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,310
Why do we expect people to work well

142
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,806
if they're being interrupted
all day at the office?

143
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,264
How can we possibly expect
people to do their job

144
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,393
if they go to the office
and are interrupted?

145
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,324
That doesn't really seem
like it makes a lot of sense, to me.

146
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:47,216
So what are the interruptions that happen
at the office but not at other places?

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,501
Because in other places, you can have
interruptions like the TV,

148
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,796
or you could go for a walk,
or there's a fridge downstairs,

149
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,925
or you've got your own couch,
or whatever you want to do.

150
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,758
If you talk to certain managers,
they'll tell you

151
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,353
that they don't want
their employees to work at home

152
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,274
because of these distractions.

153
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:08,329
They'll sometimes also say,

154
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:11,196
"If I can't see the person,
how do I know they're working?"

155
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,521
which is ridiculous, but that's one
of the excuses that managers give.

156
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:17,802
And I'm one of these managers.
I understand. I know how this goes.

157
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,549
We all have to improve
on this sort of thing.

158
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,543
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:

159
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,201
"I can't let someone work at home.

160
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,241
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."

161
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:29,000
It turns out those aren't
the things that are distracting,

162
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,980
Because those are voluntary distractions.

163
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:33,456
You decide when you want
to be distracted by the TV,

164
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,171
when you want to turn something on,

165
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,589
or when you want to go
downstairs or go for a walk.

166
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:38,764
At the office,

167
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:40,811
most of the interruptions and distractions

168
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,952
that really cause people not
to get work done are involuntary.

169
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:47,087
So let's go through a couple of those.

170
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:50,428
Now, managers and bosses
will often have you think

171
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,456
that the real distractions at work

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,290
are things like Facebook and Twitter

173
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:58,484
and YouTube and other websites,

174
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,350
and in fact, they'll go so far
as to actually ban these sites at work.

175
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:05,715
Some of you may work at places
where you can't get to certain sites.

176
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:08,358
I mean, is this China?
What the hell is going on here?

177
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:11,125
You can't go to a website at work,
and that's the problem?

178
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,157
That's why people aren't
getting work done,

179
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:15,109
because they're on Facebook and Twitter?

180
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,386
That's kind of ridiculous.
It's a total decoy.

181
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:21,534
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,

182
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,796
these things are just
modern-day smoke breaks.

183
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,835
No one cared about letting people take
a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,

184
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:30,477
so why does anyone care
if someone goes to Facebook

185
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,612
or Twitter or YouTube here and there?

186
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,213
Those aren't the real
problems in the office.

187
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:38,848
The real problems are
what I like to call the M&Ms,

188
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:41,125
the Managers and the Meetings.

189
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,538
Those are the real problems
in the modern office today.

190
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:47,042
And this is why
things don't get done at work,

191
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,866
it's because of the M&Ms.

192
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,192
Now what's interesting is,

193
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:54,357
if you listen to all the places
that people talk about doing work,

194
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:58,345
like at home, in the car, on a plane,
late at night, or early in the morning,

195
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,500
you don't find managers and meetings.

196
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,761
You find a lot of other distractions,
but not managers and meetings.

197
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:06,762
So these are the things
that you don't find elsewhere,

198
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:08,381
but you do find at the office.

199
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:12,542
And managers are basically people
whose job it is to interrupt people.

200
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:16,058
That's pretty much what managers are for.
They're for interrupting people.

201
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:19,921
They don't really do the work, so they
make sure everyone else is doing work,

202
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,669
which is an interruption.

203
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:25,287
We have lots of managers in the world now,
and a lot of people in the world,

204
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,412
and a lot of interruptions
by these managers.

205
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,489
They have to check in:
"Hey, how's it going?

206
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,397
Show me what's up." This sort of thing.

207
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,579
They keep interrupting you
at the wrong time,

208
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,904
while you're actually trying to do
something they're paying you to do,

209
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,331
they tend to interrupt you.

210
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:39,918
That's kind of bad.

211
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:43,053
But what's even worse is the thing
that managers do most of all,

212
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:44,524
which is call meetings.

213
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:47,094
And meetings are just toxic,

214
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,120
terrible, poisonous things

215
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:51,563
during the day at work.

216
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:52,803
(Laughter)

217
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,614
We all know this to be true,

218
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:57,859
and you would never see a spontaneous
meeting called by employees.

219
00:09:57,883 --> 00:09:59,144
It doesn't work that way.

220
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:00,896
The manager calls the meeting

221
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,835
so the employees can all come together,

222
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:05,582
and it's an incredibly disruptive
thing to do to people --

223
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,796
to say, "Hey look,

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,518
we're going to bring 10 people
together right now and have a meeting.

225
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,034
I don't care what you're doing,

226
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:15,065
you've got to stop doing it,
so you can have this meeting."

227
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,463
I mean, what are the chances
that all 10 people are ready to stop?

228
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:22,240
What if they're thinking about something
important, or doing important work?

229
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:26,053
All of a sudden you tell them they have
to stop doing that to do something else.

230
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:28,796
So they go into a meeting room,
they get together,

231
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,092
and they talk about stuff
that doesn't really matter, usually.

232
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,760
Because meetings aren't work.

233
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,950
Meetings are places to go
to talk about things

234
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,671
you're supposed to be doing later.

235
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,666
But meetings also procreate.

236
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,955
So one meeting tends
to lead to another meeting,

237
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,464
which leads to another meeting.

238
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,694
There's often too many people
in the meetings,

239
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:48,443
and they're very, very expensive
to the organization.

240
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,592
Companies often think of a one-hour
meeting as a one-hour meeting,

241
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,077
but that's not true,
unless there's only one person.

242
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,625
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour
meeting, not a one-hour meeting.

243
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,926
It's 10 hours of productivity taken
from the rest of the organization

244
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,289
to have this one-hour meeting,
which probably should have been handled

245
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,796
by two or three people
talking for a few minutes.

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,359
But instead, there's a long
scheduled meeting,

247
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,954
because meetings are scheduled
the way software works,

248
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:15,379
which is in increments of 15 minutes,
or 30 minutes, or an hour.

249
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:19,046
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting
with Outlook; you can't.

250
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,044
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes
or 45 minutes or an hour.

251
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,042
And so we tend to fill these times up

252
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,225
when things should go really quickly.

253
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:29,899
So meetings and managers are
two major problems in businesses today,

254
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,082
especially at offices.

255
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,752
These things don't exist
outside of the office.

256
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:39,049
So I have some suggestions
to remedy the situation.

257
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,796
What can managers do --

258
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,796
enlightened managers, hopefully --

259
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,292
what can they do to make the office
a better place for people to work,

260
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:49,161
so it's not the last resort,
but it's the first resort,

261
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,527
so that people start to say,

262
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:53,328
"When I really want to get stuff done,
I go to the office."

263
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:55,266
Because the offices are well-equipped;

264
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,424
everything is there
for them to do the work.

265
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:00,709
But they don't want to go there right
now, so how do we change that?

266
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,767
I have three suggestions
to share with you.

267
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,662
I have about three minutes,
so that'll fit perfectly.

268
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:08,523
We've all heard
of the Casual Friday thing.

269
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,396
I don't know if people still do that.

270
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,096
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"

271
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,152
(Laughter)

272
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:17,122
Pick one Thursday once a month,

273
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:20,457
and cut it in half, just the afternoon --
I'll make it easy for you.

274
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,211
So just the afternoon, one Thursday.

275
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,489
First Thursday of the month,
just the afternoon,

276
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,577
nobody in the office
can talk to each other.

277
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,139
Just silence, that's it.

278
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,796
And what you'll find

279
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,228
is that a tremendous amount
of work gets done

280
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,856
when no one talks to each other.

281
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,944
This is when people
actually get stuff done,

282
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,484
is when no one's bothering them
or interrupting them.

283
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,469
Giving someone four hours
of uninterrupted time

284
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,667
is the best gift you can
give anybody at work.

285
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,104
It's better than a computer,

286
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,882
better than a new monitor,
better than new software,

287
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,881
or whatever people typically use.

288
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,309
Giving them four hours
of quiet time at the office

289
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,254
is going to be incredibly valuable.

290
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,246
If you try that, I think you'll agree,
and hopefully you can do it more often.

291
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,992
So maybe it's every other week,

292
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,796
or every week, once a week,

293
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,873
afternoons no one can talk to each other.

294
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:06,984
That's something that you'll find
will really, really work.

295
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,310
Another thing you can try,

296
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:12,796
is switching from active
communication and collaboration,

297
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,011
which is like face-to-face stuff --
tapping people on the shoulder,

298
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,011
saying hi to them, having meetings,

299
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,821
and replace that with more
passive models of communication,

300
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,146
using things like email
and instant messaging,

301
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,122
or collaboration products,
things like that.

302
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,369
Now some people might say
email is really distracting,

303
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,963
I.M. is really distracting, and these
other things are really distracting,

304
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:36,559
but they're distracting at a time
of your own choice and your own choosing.

305
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,391
You can quit the email app;
you can't quit your boss.

306
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,193
You can quit I.M.;

307
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,034
you can't hide your manager.

308
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,796
You can put these things away,

309
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,201
and then you can be interrupted
on your own schedule, at your own time,

310
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,702
when you're available,
when you're ready to go again.

311
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,796
Because work, like sleep,
happens in phases.

312
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,913
So you'll be going up, doing some work,

313
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,896
and then you'll come down from that work,

314
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,372
and then maybe it's time
to check that email or I.M.

315
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:01,897
There are very, very few things
that are that urgent,

316
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,968
that need to happen, that need
to be answered right this second.

317
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,167
So if you're a manager,

318
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:09,175
start encouraging people to use
more things like I.M. and email

319
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,215
and other things that someone can put away

320
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,440
and then get back to you
on their own schedule.

321
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:17,043
And the last suggestion I have is that,

322
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,796
if you do have a meeting coming up,

323
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,446
if you have the power, just cancel it.

324
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,930
Just cancel that next meeting.

325
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,120
(Laughter)

326
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,789
Today's Friday, usually people
have meetings on Monday.

327
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:28,975
Just don't have it.

328
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,404
I don't mean move it;

329
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,070
I mean just erase it
from memory, it's gone.

330
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:35,682
And you'll find out that everything
will be just fine.

331
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:38,722
All these discussions and decisions
you thought you had to make

332
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,530
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,

333
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:42,851
just forget about them,
and things will be fine.

334
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,856
People will have a more open morning,
they can actually think.

335
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,655
You'll find out all these things
you thought you had to do,

336
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,132
you don't actually have to do.

337
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:54,148
So those are just three quick suggestions
I wanted to give you guys to think about.

338
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,197
I hope that some of these ideas
were at least provocative enough

339
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,327
for managers and bosses
and business owners

340
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:02,167
and organizers and people
who are in charge of other people,

341
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:04,062
to think about laying off a little bit,

342
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,221
and giving people more time
to get work done.

343
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,055
I think it'll all pay off in the end.

344
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,081
So, thanks for listening.

345
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,764
(Applause)
