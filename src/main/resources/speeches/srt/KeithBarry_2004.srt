1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?

2
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:16,011
Brain magic to me indicates
that area of magic

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,512
dealing with psychological
and mind-reading effects.

4
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:22,183
So unlike traditional magic,
it uses the power of words,

5
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:24,803
linguistic deception,
non-verbal communication

6
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:28,827
and various other techniques
to create the illusion of a sixth sense.

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,772
I'm going to show you all how easy it is

8
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,122
to manipulate the human mind
once you know how.

9
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:37,251
I want everybody downstairs also
to join in with me and everybody.

10
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:40,568
I want everybody to put out your hands
like this for me, first of all.

11
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,194
OK, clap them together, once.

12
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:43,796
OK, reverse your hands.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,796
Now, follow my actions exactly.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,868
Now about half the audience has
their left hand up. Why is that?

15
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,519
OK, swap them around,
put your right hand up.

16
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:54,116
Cross your hands over,
so your right hand goes over,

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,117
interlace your fingers like this,

18
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,007
then make sure your right thumb
is outside your left thumb --

19
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,180
that's very important.

20
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:02,490
Yours is the other way around,
so swap it around.

21
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:05,030
Excellent, OK. Extend
your fingers like this for me.

22
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,274
All right. Tap them together once.

23
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:11,562
OK, now, if you did not allow me
to deceive your minds,

24
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,242
you would all be able to do this.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,402
(Laughter)

26
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,615
(Laughter ends)

27
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,146
Now you can see how easy it is

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,796
for me to manipulate the human mind,
once you know how.

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,503
(Laughter)

30
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:29,765
Now, I remember when I was about 15,

31
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,359
(Laughter)

32
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,302
I read a copy of Life magazine,

33
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:38,165
which detailed a story
about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,912
who could sense printed letters --

35
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,808
there's still people trying to do it --

36
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:42,959
(Laughter)

37
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,364
-- who could sense printed letters
and even sense colors, just by touch.

38
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,796
And she was completely blind.

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,059
She could also read
the serial numbers on bills

40
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,560
when they were placed,
face down, on a hard surface.

41
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:55,796
Now, I was fascinated,
but at the same time, skeptical.

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,059
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

43
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:02,796
You know, if you actually think about it,
if somebody is totally blind --

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,462
a guy yesterday did a demonstration
in one of the rooms,

45
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:08,754
where people had to close their eyes
and they could just hear things.

46
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:11,692
And it's just a really weird thing
to try and figure out.

47
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,965
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

48
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,704
Now earlier on, as part of a TV show
that I have coming up on MTV,

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,796
I attempted to give
a similar demonstration

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,684
of what is now known as second sight.

51
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,796
So, let's take a look.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,796
(Video) Man: There we go.

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,796

Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.

58
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,796
I'm going to take you
to a secret location, OK?

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,784
Kathryn, there was no way
you could see through that blindfold.

KB: Thank you.

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,796
By the way, two days ago,
we were going to film this

110
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,796
down there, at the race course,
and we got a guy into a car,

111
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,796
and we got a camera man in the back,

112
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,357
but halfway through the drive,

113
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,827
he told me he had,
I think it was a nine-millimeter,

114
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,020
stuck to his leg.

115
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,130
So, I stopped pretty quick,
and that was it.

116
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:14,423
So, do you believe it's possible
to see through somebody else's eyes?

117
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,526
That's the question.

118
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,055
Now, most people here
would automatically say no.

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,223
OK, but I want you to realize some facts.

120
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,468
I couldn't see through the blindfold.

121
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,302
The car was not gimmicked
or tricked in any way.

122
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,264
The girl, I'd never met before, all right.

123
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,768
So, I want you to just think
about it for a moment.

124
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,446
A lot of people try to come up

125
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,137
with a logical solution
to what just happened, all right.

126
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:38,539
But because your brains are not
trained in the art of deception,

127
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:40,004
the solutions you come up with

128
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:42,384
will, 99 percent of the time,
be way off the mark.

129
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,796
This is because magic
is all about directing attention.

130
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,737
If, for instance, I didn't want
you to look at my right hand,

131
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,996
then I don't look at it.

132
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,791
But if I wanted you
to look at my right hand,

133
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,037
then I look at it, too.

134
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,180
You see, it's very simple,
once you know how,

135
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:57,907
but very complicated in other ways.

136
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:00,448
I'm going to give you
some demonstrations right now.

137
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:03,330
I need two people to help me out
real quick. Can you come up?

138
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:07,390
And let's see, down at the end, here,
can you also come up, real quick?

139
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:08,796
Do you mind? Yes, at the end.

140
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,201
OK, give them a round of applause
as they come up.

Extend your left arm, OK.

OK, keep it there.

I just touched his back,

192
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:10,796
A voodoo experiment.

193
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:14,796
(Laughter)

194
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,249
Yeah, I walk around nightclubs
all night like this.

You just take a seat
over here for a second.

197
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,796
I'm going to use you again, in a moment.

Can you take a seat
right over here, if you don't mind.

202
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,963
just take a deep breath
in through your nose,

203
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:38,537
letting it out through
your mouth, and relax.

204
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:42,279
Allow your eyes to close,
on five, four, three, two, one.

205
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:43,796
Close your eyes right now.

OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,

207
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,773
I'm merely placing you in a heightened
state of synchronicity,

208
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:50,796
so our minds are along the same lines.

209
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,796
And as you sink and drift and float
into this relaxed state of mind,

210
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,796
I'm going to take your left hand,
and just place it up here.

211
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,991
I want you to hold it there
just for a moment,

to sink and drift and float
back to the tabletop

214
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,796
at the same rate and speed

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,015
as you drift and float into this
relaxed state of awareness,

216
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,078
and allow it to go all the way
down to the tabletop.

217
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:15,221
That's it, all the way down,
all the way down.

218
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,848
and further, and further.

219
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,141
Excellent.

220
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,070
I want you to allow your hand
to stick firmly to the tabletop.

221
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,884
OK, now, allow it to stay there.

222
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:27,402
OK, now, in a moment,
you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,

223
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:29,471
and I want you
to be aware of the pressure.

224
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,795
Just be aware of the pressure.

225
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,257
And I only want you to allow your hand

226
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,805
to float slowly back up from the tabletop
as you feel the pressure release,

227
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,919

the pressure release.

228
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,796

(Laughter)

00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,856
OK, that was wonderfully done.
Let's try it again.

236
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:25,379
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea,
let's try something even more interesting.

237
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,403
Allow it to stick firmly
to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.

238
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,443
Can you stand up?
Just stand, stage forward.

239
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,926
I want you to point directly
at his forehead.

240
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,148
OK.

241
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,425
Imagine a connection between you and him.

242
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,444
Only when you want
the pressure to be released,

243
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:42,110
make an upward gesture, like this,

244
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,127
but only when you want it to be released.

245
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:45,800
You can wait as long as you want,

246
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:47,920
but only when you want
the pressure released.

247
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,500
OK, let's try it again.

248
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:58,796
OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.

249
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,796
Point directly at his forehead.

250
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,678
Only when you want the pressure
released, we'll try it again.

251
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,796
OK, it worked that time, excellent.

252
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,796
And hold it there, both of you.

253
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,059
Only when you want the pressure
to go back, make a downward gesture.

254
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,655
You can wait as long as you want.

255
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:21,629
You did it pretty quickly,
but it went down, OK.

256
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,796
Now, I want you to be aware
that in a moment,

257
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,228
when I snap my fingers,
your eyes will open, again.

258
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,447
It's OK to remember to forget,
or forget to remember what happened.

259
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:32,241
Most people ask you, "What
the hell just happened up here?"

260
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:34,648
But it's OK that even though
you're not hypnotized,

261
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:36,904
you will forget everything that happened.

262
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,796
On five, four, three, two, one --
open your eyes, wide awake.

263
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,124
Give them a round of applause,
as they go back to their seats.

264
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,661
(Applause)

265
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,052
OK, you can go back.

266
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:49,345
(Applause)

267
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,320
I once saw a film called
"The Gods Are Crazy."

268
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,796
Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.

269
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,428
Remember when they threw
the Coke out of the airplane,

270
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,780
and it landed on the ground,
and it didn't break?

271
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,128
Now, see, that's because
Coke bottles are solid.

272
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,953
It's nearly impossible
to break a Coke bottle.

273
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,374
Do you want to try it?

274
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,495
Good job. She's not taking any chances.

275
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,796
(Laughter)

276
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,201
You see, psychokinesis
is the paranormal influence

277
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,708
of the mind on physical
events and processes.

278
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:19,796
For some magicians or mentalists,

279
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,796
sometimes the spoon will bend
or melt, sometimes it will not.

280
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,304
Sometimes the object will slide
across the table, sometimes it will not.

281
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,600
It depends on how much
energy you have that day,

282
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,688
so on and so forth.

283
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:33,570
We're going to try an experiment
in psychokinesis, right now.

284
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,723
Come right over here, next to me.
Excellent.

285
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:37,532
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.

286
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,128
Make sure it is solid, there's only
one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.

287
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:44,153
And you can whack it against the table,
if you want; be careful.

288
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,177
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.

289
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,551
I want you to pinch right here
with two fingers and your thumb.

290
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:52,129
Excellent.
Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.

291
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:54,106
I want you to examine the shard of glass.

292
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,705
Careful, it's sharp.
Just hold on to it for a moment.

293
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:57,896
Now, hold it out here.

294
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,821
I want you to imagine, right now,
a broken relationship from many years ago.

295
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,448
I want you to imagine
all the negative energy

296
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,624
from that broken
relationship, from that guy,

297
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:10,152
being imparted into the broken
piece of glass,

298
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,796
which will represent him, OK.

299
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,868
But I want you to take this
very seriously.

300
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,178
Stare at the glass,
ignore everybody right here.

301
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:19,325
In a moment, you'll feel
a certain sensation, OK,

302
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,165
and when you feel that sensation,

303
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:23,796
I want you to drop the piece
of glass into the bottle.

304
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,717
Think of that guy, that Ba -- that guy.

305
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,796
(Laughter)

306
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,233
I'm trying to be good here.

307
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,067
OK, and when you feel the sensation --

308
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:35,350
it might take a while --
drop it into the glass.

309
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,629
OK, drop it in.

310
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,796
Now, imagine all that negative
energy in there.

311
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,453
Imagine his name
and imagine him inside the glass.

312
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,721
And I want you to release
that negative energy

313
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,269
by shaking it from side to side.

314
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,387
(Burst)

315
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,796
(Laughter)

316
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,352
That was a lot of negative energy,
built up in there.

317
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,438
(Laughter)

318
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:10,796
(Applause)

319
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,821
I also want you to look at me
and think of his name.

320
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:17,820
OK, think of how many letters
in the title of his name.

321
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:19,526
There's five letters in the title.

322
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,797
You didn't react to that,
so it's four letters.

323
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,796
Think of one of the letters in the title.

324
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,796
There's a K in his name, there is a K.

325
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,196
I knew that because my name
starts with a K also,

326
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,057
but his name doesn't start
with a K, it starts with an M.

327
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,503
Tell Mike I said hello,
the next time you see him.

328
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,196
Was that his name?
Nicole: Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,997

334
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:52,796
I've got one more thing
to share with you right now.

335
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,201
Actually, Chris, I was going
to pick you for this,

336
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,464
but instead of picking you,
can you hop up here

337
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,796
and pick a victim
for this next experiment?

338
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,392
And it should be a male victim,
that's the only thing.

339
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,796
Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.

340

Now, Steve -- oh, you
can check underneath.

350
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,183
Go ahead, I've no fancy
assistants underneath there.

351
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,722
They insist that because I was a magician,

352
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,286
put a nice, black tablecloth on.

There you are, OK.

One, two, three and four.

357

Now, they're all the exact
same except this one

358
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,798
obviously has a stainless steel
spike sticking out of it.

359
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,287
I want you to examine it,

Happy?

to stand in front of the table,

When I stand in front of the table,

364
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,366
I want you to put the cups on the plinths,

365
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,629
in any order you want,
and then mix them all up,

366

the spike is, all right?

367
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:09,796

KB: Yes, and just to help you out,

369
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,806
I'll block them from view,
so nobody can see what you're doing.

370
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,402
I'll also look away. So, go
ahead and mix them up, now.

371

OK, and tell me when you're done.

sure that's well hidden.

(Laughter)

382
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,796
Now, Steve, you know where the spike is,
but nobody else, does? Correct?

383
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,059
But I don't want you to know either,
so swivel around on your chair.

384
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:02,083
They'll keep an eye on me
to make sure I don't do anything funny.

385
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:04,154
No, stay around, OK.

386
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,378
Now, Steve, look back.

Now you don't know where the spike is,

through this blindfold?

Don't stack them up, OK.
Give them an extra mix up.

Don't move the cups, I don't want
anybody to see where the spike is,
