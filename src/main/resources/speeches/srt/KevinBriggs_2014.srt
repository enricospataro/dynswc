1
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:13,564
I recently retired

2
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,608
from the California Highway Patrol

3
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:18,545
after 23 years of service.

4
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,511
The majority of those 23 years

5
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:23,139
was spent patrolling the southern end

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,672
of Marin County,

7
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,849
which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.

8
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,136
The bridge is an iconic structure,

9
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:31,389
known worldwide

10
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:34,065
for its beautiful views of San Francisco,

11
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:38,456
the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.

12
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:42,872
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,

13
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:47,451
being one of the most utilized sites in the world.

14
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:50,581
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.

15
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,904
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
in charge of building the bridge,

16
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:56,508
was quoted as saying,

17
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:59,904
"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,613
Suicide from the bridge

19
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:05,379
is neither practical nor probable."

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,673
But since its opening,

21
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:10,820
over 1,600 people have leapt to their death

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,982
from that bridge.

23
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,186
Some believe that traveling

24
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,251
between the two towers

25
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,374
will lead you to another dimension --

26
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:22,830
this bridge has been romanticized as such —

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,409
that the fall from that

28
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,443
frees you from all your worries and grief,

29
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:29,227
and the waters below

30
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,351
will cleanse your soul.

31
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,675
But let me tell you what actually occurs

32
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:34,861
when the bridge is used

33
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,915
as a means of suicide.

34
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:40,369
After a free fall of four to five seconds,

35
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,038
the body strikes the water

36
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:46,720
at about 75 miles an hour.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,437
That impact shatters bones,

38
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:52,789
some of which then puncture vital organs.

39
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:55,138
Most die on impact.

40
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,890
Those that don't

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,483
generally flail in the water helplessly,

42
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:01,702
and then drown.

43
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,870
I don't think that those who contemplate

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,692
this method of suicide

45
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,868
realize how grisly a death that they will face.

46
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,996
This is the cord.

47
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,053
Except for around the two towers,

48
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,341
there is 32 inches of steel

49
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,871
paralleling the bridge.

50
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,156
This is where most folks stand

51
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,690
before taking their lives.

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,724
I can tell you from experience

53
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:28,458
that once the person is on that cord,

54
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,216
and at their darkest time,

55
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,510
it is very difficult to bring them back.

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,552
I took this photo last year

57
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,488
as this young woman spoke to an officer

58
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,486
contemplating her life.

59
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:41,742
I want to tell you very happily

60
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:43,850
that we were successful that day

61
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,774
in getting her back over the rail.

62
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,166
When I first began working on the bridge,

63
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,650
we had no formal training.

64
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,444
You struggled to funnel your
way through these calls.

65
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,898
This was not only a disservice

66
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,947
to those contemplating suicide,

67
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,740
but to the officers as well.

68
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,920
We've come a long, long way since then.

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,489
Now, veteran officers and psychologists

70
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,160
train new officers.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,369
This is Jason Garber.

72
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:17,580
I met Jason on July 22 of last year

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,695
when I get received a call

74
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:20,637
of a possible suicidal subject

75
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,386
sitting on the cord near midspan.

76
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,083
I responded, and when I arrived,

77
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,897
I observed Jason

78
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,268
speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.

79
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,792
Jason was just 32 years old

80
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,624
and had flown out here from New Jersey.

81
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:38,168
As a matter of fact,

82
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,986
he had flown out here on two other occasions

83
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,748
from New Jersey

84
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:45,162
to attempt suicide on this bridge.

85
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:48,720
After about an hour of speaking with Jason,

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,455
he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.

87
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:54,890
Recalling your Greek mythology,

88
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,860
Zeus created Pandora,

89
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,214
and sent her down to Earth with a box,

90
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:04,118
and told her, "Never, ever open that box."

91
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,760
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,162
and she did open the box.

93
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,014
Out flew plagues, sorrows,

94
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:15,226
and all sorts of evils against man.

95
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:19,805
The only good thing in the box was hope.

96
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,378
Jason then asked us,

97
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:25,362
"What happens when you open the box

98
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:28,544
and hope isn't there?"

99
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,594
He paused a few moments,

100
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,033
leaned to his right,

101
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:36,234
and was gone.

102
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,104
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey

103
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:43,884
had just committed suicide.

104
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,884
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,

105
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:49,446
and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,

106
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,210
that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,

107
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,430
because that very next day,

108
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,950
their family rabbi called to check on me.

109
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,744
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.

110
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,952
The collateral damage of suicide

111
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:10,055
affects so many people.

112
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:13,036
I pose these questions to you:

113
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,704
What would you do if your family member,

114
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:18,812
friend or loved one was suicidal?

115
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,246
What would you say?

116
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:24,476
Would you know what to say?

117
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:28,402
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,

118
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:30,650
but the listening.

119
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,266
Listen to understand.

120
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,794
Don't argue, blame,

121
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:41,562
or tell the person you know how they feel,

122
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:44,173
because you probably don't.

123
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,084
By just being there,

124
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:51,407
you may just be the turning point that they need.

125
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,511
If you think someone is suicidal,

126
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:58,225
don't be afraid to confront
them and ask the question.

127
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:02,435
One way of asking them the question is like this:

128
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,849
"Others in similar circumstances

129
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,017
have thought about ending their life;

130
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,776
have you had these thoughts?"

131
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,572
Confronting the person head-on

132
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,522
may just save their life and
be the turning point for them.

133
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,971
Some other signs to look for:

134
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:23,119
hopelessness, believing that things are terrible

135
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,246
and never going to get better;

136
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:29,691
helplessness, believing that there is nothing

137
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,123
that you can do about it;

138
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,720
recent social withdrawal;

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,537
and a loss of interest in life.

140
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:43,459
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,

141
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:46,660
and I received an email from a lady

142
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,145
that I'd like to read you her letter.

143
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:59,257
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,

144
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,070
and she wrote this me this email

145
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,440
just a couple of days ago,

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
and it's with her permission and blessing

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,465
that I read this to you.

148
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:13,467
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.

149
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,401
That must be quite the experience to be there.

150
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,033
I'm thinking I should go walk
the bridge this weekend.

151
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,566
Just wanted to drop you a note.

152
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,787
Hope you get the word out to many people

153
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,899
and they go home talking about it

154
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,565
to their friends who tell their friends, etc.

155
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:34,009
I'm still pretty numb,

156
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,081
but noticing more moments of really realizing

157
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,793
Mike isn't coming home.

158
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,540
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco

159
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,457
to watch the 49ers game with his father

160
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,490
on January 19.

161
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,434
He never made it there.

162
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,481
I called Petaluma police

163
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,977
and reported him missing that evening.

164
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,879
The next morning,

165
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,602
two officers came to my home

166
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:04,106
and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.

167
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:06,570
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge

168
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,822
at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.

169
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:13,442
Thanks so much

170
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,626
for standing up for those

171
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,178
who may be only temporarily too weak

172
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,720
to stand for themselves.

173
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,740
Who hasn't been low before

174
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,516
without suffering from a true mental illness?

175
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,877
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.

176
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:32,274
My prayers are with you for your fight.

177
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:35,870
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,

178
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,596
is supposed to be a passage across

179
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,679
our beautiful bay,

180
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,366
not a graveyard.

181
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:48,630
Good luck this week. Vicky."

182
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,673
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her

183
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,615
to go down to that bridge and walk the path

184
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:57,053
that her son took that day,

185
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:02,127
and also the courage just to carry on.

186
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:05,873
I'd like to introduce you to a man

187
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:11,515
I refer to as hope and courage.

188
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,154
On March 11 of 2005,

189
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,817
I responded to a radio call of a possible

190
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,031
suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk

191
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:20,519
near the north tower.

192
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,207
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk

193
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,919
and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,

194
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,455
standing on the sidewalk.

195
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:31,880
When he saw me, he immediately traversed

196
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,057
that pedestrian rail,

197
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:34,929
and stood on that small pipe

198
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,001
which goes around the tower.

199
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:40,335
For the next hour and a half,

200
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:43,263
I listened as Kevin spoke about

201
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:46,151
his depression and hopelessness.

202
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,825
Kevin decided on his own that day

203
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,507
to come back over that rail

204
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,239
and give life another chance.

205
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,010
When Kevin came back over,

206
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,051
I congratulated him.

207
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,801
"This is a new beginning, a new life."

208
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,835
But I asked him, "What was it

209
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,560
that made you come back

210
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,350
and give hope and life another chance?"

211
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,041
And you know what he told me?

212
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,571
He said, "You listened.

213
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,771
You let me speak, and you just listened."

214
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:19,730
Shortly after this incident,

215
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,989
I received a letter from Kevin's mother,

216
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,901
and I have that letter with me,

217
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,751
and I'd like to read it to you.

218
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,907
"Dear Mr. Briggs,

219
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:33,772
Nothing will erase the events of March 11,

220
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,900
but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.

221
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,193
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.

222
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:43,915
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness

223
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:46,749
for which he has been properly medicated.

224
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:50,117
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,

225
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:54,065
completely unaware of any hereditary traits,

226
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:58,249
but, thank God, now we know.

227
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,075
Kevin is straight, as he says.

228
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,760
We truly thank God for you.

229
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,161
Sincerely indebted to you,

230
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,853
Narvella Berthia."

231
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,901
And on the bottom she writes,

232
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:16,337
"P.S. When I visited San Francisco
General Hospital that evening,

233
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:18,265
you were listed as the patient.

234
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:21,560
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."

235
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:27,377
Today, Kevin is a loving father

236
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,062
and contributing member of society.

237
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,531
He speaks openly

238
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,465
about the events that day and his depression

239
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,147
in the hopes that his story

240
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,221
will inspire others.

241
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:42,651
Suicide is not just something
I've encountered on the job.

242
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,683
It's personal.

243
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,557
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.

244
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:52,431
That act, although ending his own pain,

245
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:56,977
robbed me from ever getting to know him.

246
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:59,643
This is what suicide does.

247
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:01,991
For most suicidal folks,

248
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,945
or those contemplating suicide,

249
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:06,651
they wouldn't think of hurting another person.

250
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:10,235
They just want their own pain to end.

251
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:14,271
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:

252
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:19,929
sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.

253
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:22,649
In my career, I've responded to

254
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,002
and been involved in hundreds

255
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,780
of mental illness and suicide calls

256
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,574
around the bridge.

257
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:33,085
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,

258
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,057
I've only lost two,

259
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:37,243
but that's two too many.

260
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:39,255
One was Jason.

261
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,511
The other was a man I spoke to

262
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,194
for about an hour.

263
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:45,610
During that time, he shook my hand

264
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,347
on three occasions.

265
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:50,423
On that final handshake,

266
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,757
he looked at me, and he said,

267
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:58,160
"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."

268
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,293
And he leapt.

269
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:03,099
Horrible, absolutely horrible.

270
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,075
I do want to tell you, though,

271
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,427
the vast majority of folks

272
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:10,949
that we do get to contact on that bridge

273
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,145
do not commit suicide.

274
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,135
Additionally, that very few

275
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,791
who have jumped off the bridge and lived

276
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,137
and can talk about it,

277
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:23,950
that one to two percent,

278
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,781
most of those folks have said

279
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:29,135
that the second that they let go of that rail,

280
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,700
they knew that they had made a mistake

281
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,751
and they wanted to live.

282
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,184
I tell people, the bridge not only connects

283
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,465
Marin to San Francisco,

284
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:44,657
but people together also.

285
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,450
That connection, or bridge that we make,

286
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,879
is something that each and every one of us

287
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,873
should strive to do.

288
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,897
Suicide is preventable.

289
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:59,231
There is help. There is hope.

290
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,261
Thank you very much.

291
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,261
(Applause)
