1
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,668
So, why does good sex so often fade,

2
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:20,312
even for couples who continue
to love each other as much as ever?

3
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,326
And why does good intimacy
not guarantee good sex,

4
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,213
contrary to popular belief?

5
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,151
Or, the next question would be,

6
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,215
can we want what we already have?

7
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:33,904
That's the million-dollar question, right?

8
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,150
And why is the forbidden so erotic?

9
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:39,890
What is it about transgression
that makes desire so potent?

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,898
And why does sex make babies,

11
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:44,532
and babies spell erotic
disaster in couples?

12
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,163
(Laughter)

13
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,365
It's kind of the fatal
erotic blow, isn't it?

14
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:51,147
And when you love, how does it feel?

15
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,651
And when you desire, how is it different?

16
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:55,968
These are some of the questions

17
00:00:55,992 --> 00:01:01,458
that are at the center of my exploration
on the nature of erotic desire

18
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,906
and its concomitant
dilemmas in modern love.

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,880
So I travel the globe,

20
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:12,263
and what I'm noticing is that everywhere
where romanticism has entered,

21
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,712
there seems to be a crisis of desire.

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,956
A crisis of desire,
as in owning the wanting --

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,966
desire as an expression
of our individuality,

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,955
of our free choice,
of our preferences, of our identity --

25
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,281
desire that has become a central concept

26
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:33,505
as part of modern love
and individualistic societies.

27
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:36,746
You know, this is the first time
in the history of humankind

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,176
where we are trying to experience
sexuality in the long term

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,562
not because we want 14 children,

30
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,758
for which we need to have even more
because many of them won't make it,

31
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:54,927
and not because it is exclusively
a woman's marital duty.

32
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:59,726
This is the first time
that we want sex over time

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,296
about pleasure and connection
that is rooted in desire.

34
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,340
So what sustains desire,
and why is it so difficult?

35
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:12,883
And at the heart of sustaining
desire in a committed relationship,

36
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:18,490
I think, is the reconciliation
of two fundamental human needs.

37
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:23,652
On the one hand, our need
for security, for predictability,

38
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,571
for safety, for dependability,

39
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,044
for reliability, for permanence.

40
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,162
All these anchoring,
grounding experiences of our lives

41
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,338
that we call home.

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,264
But we also have an equally
strong need -- men and women --

43
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,713
for adventure, for novelty,

44
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:45,848
for mystery, for risk, for danger,

45
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:49,138
for the unknown,
for the unexpected, surprise --

46
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:51,069
you get the gist.

47
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:52,693
For journey, for travel.

48
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,593
So reconciling our need for security
and our need for adventure

49
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:58,167
into one relationship,

50
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:01,050
or what we today like to call
a passionate marriage,

51
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,332
used to be a contradiction in terms.

52
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:07,046
Marriage was an economic institution

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,108
in which you were
given a partnership for life

54
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,852
in terms of children and social status

55
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,659
and succession and companionship.

56
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:19,688
But now we want our partner
to still give us all these things,

57
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:22,140
but in addition I want you
to be my best friend

58
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:25,374
and my trusted confidant
and my passionate lover to boot,

59
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:26,778
and we live twice as long.

60
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:29,698
(Laughter)

61
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:33,702
So we come to one person,
and we basically are asking them

62
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,618
to give us what once
an entire village used to provide.

63
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,930
Give me belonging, give me identity,

64
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,269
give me continuity,

65
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:44,929
but give me transcendence
and mystery and awe all in one.

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,959
Give me comfort, give me edge.

67
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,881
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.

68
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,171
Give me predictability, give me surprise.

69
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,544
And we think it's a given,

70
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:55,169
and toys and lingerie
are going to save us with that.

71
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,094
(Laughter)

72
00:03:57,118 --> 00:04:01,063
(Applause)

73
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:04,548
So now we get to the existential
reality of the story, right?

74
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,978
Because I think, in some way --

75
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,659
and I'll come back to that --

76
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,110
but the crisis of desire
is often a crisis of the imagination.

77
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:17,733
So why does good sex so often fade?

78
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,281
What is the relationship
between love and desire?

79
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,182
How do they relate,
and how do they conflict?

80
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,055
Because therein lies
the mystery of eroticism.

81
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,449
So if there is a verb, for me,
that comes with love, it's "to have."

82
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:34,159
And if there is a verb that comes
with desire, it is "to want."

83
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:39,063
In love, we want to have,
we want to know the beloved.

84
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:41,369
We want to minimize the distance.

85
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,349
We want to contract that gap.

86
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,645
We want to neutralize the tensions.

87
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,119
We want closeness.

88
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,987
But in desire,

89
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:52,802
we tend to not really want to go back
to the places we've already gone.

90
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,147
Forgone conclusion
does not keep our interest.

91
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,685
In desire, we want an Other,

92
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,734
somebody on the other side
that we can go visit,

93
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,916
that we can go spend some time with,

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,085
that we can go see what goes on
in their red-light district.

95
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:08,696
You know?

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,089
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.

97
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:14,094
Or in other words,
I sometimes say, fire needs air.

98
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,332
Desire needs space.

99
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:20,263
And when it's said like that,
it's often quite abstract.

100
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,954
But then I took a question with me.

101
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,883
And I've gone to more than 20 countries
in the last few years

102
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,271
with "Mating in Captivity,"
and I asked people,

103
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:30,427
when do you find yourself
most drawn to your partner?

104
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:33,318
Not attracted sexually,
per Se, but most drawn.

105
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:38,324
And across culture, across religion,
and across gender -- except for one --

106
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:42,226
there are a few answers
that just keep coming back.

107
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,496
So the first group is:

108
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,711
I am most drawn to my partner
when she is away,

109
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,296
when we are apart, when we reunite.

110
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:57,313
Basically, when I get back in touch

111
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:01,024
with my ability to imagine myself
with my partner,

112
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:04,106
when my imagination comes
back in the picture,

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,770
and when I can root it
in absence and in longing,

114
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:11,015
which is a major component of desire.

115
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:14,718
But then the second group
is even more interesting.

116
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,403
I am most drawn to my partner

117
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,949
when I see him in the studio,

118
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,520
when she is onstage,

119
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,220
when he is in his element,

120
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:24,758
when she's doing something
she's passionate about,

121
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:28,163
when I see him at a party
and other people are really drawn to him,

122
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,108
when I see her hold court.

123
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:34,815
Basically, when I look at my partner
radiant and confident.

124
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,723
Probably the biggest
turn-on across the board.

125
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,749
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.

126
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:43,766
I look at this person --
by the way, in desire

127
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,543
people rarely talk about it,
when we are blended into one,

128
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,187
five centimeters from each other.

129
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,122
I don't know in inches how much that is.

130
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:53,037
But it's also not when the other person
is that far apart

131
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,797
that you no longer see them.

132
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:58,821
It's when I'm looking at my partner
from a comfortable distance,

133
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:03,170
where this person that is already
so familiar, so known,

134
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:07,634
is momentarily once again
somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.

135
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:12,864
And in this space between me
and the other lies the erotic élan,

136
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:15,024
lies that movement toward the other.

137
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,620
Because sometimes, as Proust says,

138
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,295
mystery is not
about traveling to new places,

139
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,474
but it's about looking with new eyes.

140
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:26,327
And so, when I see my partner
on his own or her own,

141
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:29,160
doing something
in which they are enveloped,

142
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:33,575
I look at this person and I momentarily
get a shift in perception,

143
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,536
and I stay open to the mysteries
that are living right next to me.

144
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,591
And then, more importantly,
in this description about the other

145
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,441
or myself -- it's the same --

146
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,522
what is most interesting
is that there is no neediness in desire.

147
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,850
Nobody needs anybody.

148
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,332
There is no caretaking in desire.

149
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:56,500
Caretaking is mightily loving.

150
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:58,228
It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.

151
00:07:58,252 --> 00:07:59,253
(Laughter)

152
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,606
I have yet to see somebody
who is so turned on

153
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,308
by somebody who needs them.

154
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,048
Wanting them is one thing.

155
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,801
Needing them is a shot down

156
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,702
and women have known that forever,

157
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,309
because anything
that will bring up parenthood

158
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,672
will usually decrease the erotic charge.

159
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:14,909
(Laughter)

160
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,649
For good reasons, right?

161
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,902
And then the third group
of answers usually would be:

162
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:24,322
when I'm surprised,
when we laugh together,

163
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,607
as somebody said to me
in the office today,

164
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,631
when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,

165
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,763
it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.

166
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:35,169
But basically it's when there is novelty.

167
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:38,005
But novelty isn't about new positions.

168
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,960
It isn't a repertoire of techniques.

169
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:43,205
Novelty is, what parts
of you do you bring out?

170
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,011
What parts of you are just being seen?

171
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,953
Because in some way one could say
sex isn't something you do, eh?

172
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,318
Sex is a place you go.

173
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:53,187
It's a space you enter

174
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,733
inside yourself
and with another, or others.

175
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:58,622
So where do you go in sex?

176
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,407
What parts of you do you connect to?

177
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:03,606
What do you seek to express there?

178
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,796
Is it a place for transcendence
and spiritual union?

179
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,123
Is it a place for naughtiness
and is it a place to be safely aggressive?

180
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,467
Is it a place where you
can finally surrender

181
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:16,635
and not have to take
responsibility for everything?

182
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,611
Is it a place where you can
express your infantile wishes?

183
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,891
What comes out there? It's a language.

184
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,033
It isn't just a behavior.

185
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:27,203
And it's the poetic of that language
that I'm interested in,

186
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:30,791
which is why I began to explore
this concept of erotic intelligence.

187
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:32,981
You know, animals have sex.

188
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:36,896
It's the pivot, it's biology,
it's the natural instinct.

189
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,150
We are the only ones
who have an erotic life,

190
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:45,332
which means that it's sexuality
transformed by the human imagination.

191
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:49,562
We are the only ones
who can make love for hours,

192
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:52,434
have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,

193
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,623
and touch nobody,
just because we can imagine it.

194
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:59,187
We can hint at it.
We don't even have to do it.

195
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,681
We can experience that powerful
thing called anticipation,

196
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,129
which is a mortar to desire.

197
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:08,772
The ability to imagine it,
as if it's happening,

198
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,170
to experience it as if it's happening,

199
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,680
while nothing is happening

200
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,971
and everything is happening,
at the same time.

201
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,895
So when I began to think about eroticism,

202
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,490
I began to think about the poetics of sex.

203
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,576
And if I look at it as an intelligence,

204
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,773
then it's something that you cultivate.

205
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,345
What are the ingredients?

206
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,016
Imagination, playfulness,

207
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,152
novelty, curiosity, mystery.

208
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:38,363
But the central agent is really
that piece called the imagination.

209
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,522
But more importantly,
for me to begin to understand

210
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,118
who are the couples
who have an erotic spark,

211
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,944
what sustains desire,

212
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:49,358
I had to go back
to the original definition of eroticism,

213
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,215
the mystical definition,

214
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,326
and I went through it
through a bifurcation

215
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,448
by looking, actually, at trauma,

216
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,239
which is the other side.

217
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,464
And I looked at it,

218
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,818
looking at the community
that I had grown up in,

219
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:04,656
which was a community in Belgium,
all Holocaust survivors,

220
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,286
and in my community,
there were two groups:

221
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,442
those who didn't die,
and those who came back to life.

222
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:14,497
And those who didn't die lived
often very tethered to the ground,

223
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,012
could not experience
pleasure, could not trust,

224
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:22,037
because when you're vigilant,
worried, anxious, and insecure,

225
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:25,600
you can't lift your head
to go and take off in space

226
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:28,312
and be playful and safe and imaginative.

227
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,851
Those who came back to life

228
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,161
were those who understood
the erotic as an antidote to death.

229
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,944
They knew how to keep themselves alive.

230
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:39,311
And when I began to listen

231
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,841
to the sexlessness
of the couples that I work with,

232
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:44,809
I sometimes would hear people
say, "I want more sex,"

233
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,362
but generally, people want better sex,

234
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:50,616
and better is to reconnect
with that quality of aliveness,

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,419
of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,

236
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:55,044
of Eros, of energy

237
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,739
that sex used to afford them,

238
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:59,008
or that they've hoped
it would afford them.

239
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,977
And so I began to ask
a different question.

240
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:07,087
"I shut myself off when ..."
began to be the question.

241
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:09,101
"I turn off my desires when ..."

242
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,794
Which is not the same question as,

243
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:13,892
"What turns me off is ..."
and "You turn me off when ..."

244
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:17,828
And people began to say,
"I turn myself off when

245
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,733
I feel dead inside,
when I don't like my body,

246
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,002
when I feel old,

247
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:23,749
when I haven't had time for myself,

248
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,373
when I haven't had a chance
to even check in with you,

249
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,117
when I don't perform well at work,

250
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,566
when I feel low self esteem,

251
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,557
when I don't have a sense of self-worth,

252
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:34,436
when I don't feel like I have
a right to want, to take,

253
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,092
to receive pleasure."

254
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:39,126
And then I began to ask
the reverse question.

255
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,960
"I turn myself on when ..."

256
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:43,785
Because most of the time,
people like to ask the question,

257
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,995
"You turn me on, what turns me on,"

258
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,268
and I'm out of the question, you know?

259
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,899
Now, if you are dead inside,

260
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:52,644
the other person can do
a lot of things for Valentine's.

261
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:55,573
It won't make a dent.
There is nobody at the reception desk.

262
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:56,871
(Laughter)

263
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:59,273
So I turn myself on when,

264
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:02,757
I turn on my desires, I wake up when ...

265
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:07,902
Now, in this paradox
between love and desire,

266
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:10,028
what seems to be so puzzling

267
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:13,921
is that the very ingredients
that nurture love --

268
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,370
mutuality, reciprocity,

269
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:20,131
protection, worry,
responsibility for the other --

270
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:23,575
are sometimes the very ingredients
that stifle desire.

271
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,318
Because desire comes
with a host of feelings

272
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:32,196
that are not always
such favorites of love:

273
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,989
jealousy, possessiveness,

274
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,561
aggression, power, dominance,

275
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,339
naughtiness, mischief.

276
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:42,651
Basically most of us will get turned on
at night by the very same things

277
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:45,038
that we will demonstrate
against during the day.

278
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,700
You know, the erotic mind
is not very politically correct.

279
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,356
If everybody was fantasizing
on a bed of roses,

280
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,004
we wouldn't be having such
interesting talks about this.

281
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,029
(Laughter)

282
00:13:55,053 --> 00:14:00,386
But no, in our mind up there
are a host of things going on

283
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,553
that we don't always know
how to bring to the person that we love,

284
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,508
because we think love
comes with selflessness

285
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:10,078
and in fact desire comes
with a certain amount of selfishness

286
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,055
in the best sense of the word:

287
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,459
the ability to stay connected
to one's self in the presence of another.

288
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,433
So I want to draw
that little image for you,

289
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:23,142
because this need to reconcile
these two sets of needs,

290
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,686
we are born with that.

291
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,582
Our need for connection,
our need for separateness,

292
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,791
or our need for security and adventure,

293
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,645
or our need for togetherness
and for autonomy,

294
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:35,820
and if you think about the little kid
who sits on your lap

295
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,723
and who is cozily nested here
and very secure and comfortable,

296
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:43,989
and at some point all of us
need to go out into the world

297
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,132
to discover and to explore.

298
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:47,990
That's the beginning of desire,

299
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,830
that exploratory need,
curiosity, discovery.

300
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:56,736
And then at some point they turn
around and they look at you.

301
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,509
And if you tell them,

302
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,530
"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.

303
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:02,679
Go for it. There's so much fun out there,"

304
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,229
then they can turn away
and they can experience

305
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:07,434
connection and separateness
at the same time.

306
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,248
They can go off in their imagination,
off in their body,

307
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:12,900
off in their playfulness,

308
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:16,058
all the while knowing that there's
somebody when they come back.

309
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,852
But if on this side
there is somebody who says,

310
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,432
"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.

311
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,711
My partner hasn't taken care
of me in so long.

312
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,083
What's so good out there?

313
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:29,229
Don't we have everything
you need together, you and I?"

314
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,342
then there are a few little reactions

315
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:34,422
that all of us can pretty much recognize.

316
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,685
Some of us will come back,

317
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,462
came back a long time ago,

318
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:41,871
and that little child who comes back

319
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:44,824
is the child who will forgo
a part of himself

320
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,562
in order not to lose the other.

321
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:50,552
I will lose my freedom
in order not to lose connection.

322
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,886
And I will learn to love in a certain way

323
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,726
that will become burdened with extra worry

324
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,270
and extra responsibility
and extra protection,

325
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,734
and I won't know how to leave you

326
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:07,278
in order to go play,
in order to go experience pleasure,

327
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:10,518
in order to discover,
to enter inside myself.

328
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,041
Translate this into adult language.

329
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:14,915
It starts very young.

330
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,218
It continues into our sex lives
up to the end.

331
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,057
Child number two comes back

332
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,123
but looks like that
over their shoulder all the time.

333
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,902
"Are you going to be there?

334
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,998
Are you going to curse me, scold me?

335
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:29,779
Are you going to be angry with me?"

336
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:33,398
And they may be gone,
but they're never really away.

337
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,803
And those are often the people
that will tell you,

338
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,929
"In the beginning, it was super hot."

339
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:40,106
Because in the beginning,

340
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,458
the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong

341
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:46,351
that it actually led
to the decrease of desire.

342
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:50,379
The more connected I became,
the more responsible I felt,

343
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:53,502
the less I was able to let go
in your presence.

344
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,570
The third child doesn't really come back.

345
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,574
So what happens,
if you want to sustain desire,

346
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,814
it's that real dialectic piece.

347
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:05,495
On the one hand you want the security
in order to be able to go.

348
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,247
On the other hand if you can't go,
you can't have pleasure,

349
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:12,291
you can't culminate,
you don't have an orgasm,

350
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:14,710
you don't get excited
because you spend your time

351
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,569
in the body and the head
of the other and not in your own.

352
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:24,212
So in this dilemma about reconciling
these two sets of fundamental needs,

353
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:28,385
there are a few things that I've come
to understand erotic couples do.

354
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,362
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.

355
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,868
They understand
that there is an erotic space

356
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,492
that belongs to each of them.

357
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:39,078
They also understand
that foreplay is not something you do

358
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,913
five minutes before the real thing.

359
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,382
Foreplay pretty much starts
at the end of the previous orgasm.

360
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:48,385
They also understand
that an erotic space isn't about,

361
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,940
you begin to stroke the other.

362
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:53,346
It's about you create a space
where you leave Management Inc.,

363
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,005
maybe where you leave the Agile program --

364
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,713
(Laughter)

365
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:02,989
And you actually just enter that place
where you stop being the good citizen

366
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,653
who is taking care of things
and being responsible.

367
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:09,197
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.

368
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,352
They don't really do well together.

369
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,028
Erotic couples also understand
that passion waxes and wanes.

370
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,852
It's pretty much like the moon.

371
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,597
It has intermittent eclipses.

372
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,220
But what they know
is they know how to resurrect it.

373
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:23,912
They know how to bring it back.

374
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,556
And they know how to bring it back

375
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,942
because they have
demystified one big myth,

376
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,315
which is the myth of spontaneity,

377
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,746
which is that it's just going
to fall from heaven

378
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,728
while you're folding the laundry
like a deus ex machina,

379
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,697
and in fact they understood

380
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:42,863
that whatever is going to just happen
in a long-term relationship, already has.

381
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,649
Committed sex is premeditated sex.

382
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,965
It's willful. It's intentional.

383
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,037
It's focus and presence.

384
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,054
Merry Valentine's.

385
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,224
(Applause)
