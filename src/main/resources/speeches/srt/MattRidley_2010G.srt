1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
the future of the world was bleak.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
The population explosion was unstoppable.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Global famine was inevitable.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
was going to shorten our lives.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
The acid rain was falling on the forests.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
The oil was running out,

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
None of those things happened,

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
(Laughter)

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
the average per-capita income

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
of the average person on the planet,

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
in real terms, adjusted for inflation,

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
has tripled.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Per-capita food production

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
is up by a third.

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
How did we achieve that?

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
How did we become

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
the only species

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
that becomes more prosperous

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
as it becomes more populous?

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
and the level of the graph

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
represents GDP per capita.

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
I think to answer that question

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
you need to understand

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
how human beings bring together their brains

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
to meet and, indeed, to mate.

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
In other words, you need to understand

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
how ideas have sex.

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
I want you to imagine

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
how we got from making objects like this

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
to making objects like this.

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
These are both real objects.

43
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
of the kind made by Homo erectus.

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
The other is obviously a computer mouse.

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
I've tried to work out which is bigger,

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
and it's almost impossible.

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
The differences are what interest me,

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design

54
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
for about a million years --

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.

56
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Homo erectus made the same tool

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
for 30,000 generations.

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Of course there were a few changes,

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
There was no progress, no innovation.

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
And there's another difference too,

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
The object on the right is made from

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
a confection of different substances,

67
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,

69
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,

70
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
the idea of transistors.

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
They've all been combined together in this technology.

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
And it's this combination,

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
because I think it's the secret to understanding

75
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
what's happening in the world.

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:

77
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.

78
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
They've come together.

79
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?

80
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.

81
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,

82
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
a green one and a red one,

83
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
then one has to be better than the other.

84
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
One goes extinct for the other to survive.

85
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
But if you have a sexual species,

86
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
then it's possible for an individual

87
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
to inherit both mutations

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
from different lineages.

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
So what sex does is it enables the individual

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
to draw upon

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
the genetic innovations of the whole species.

92
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
It's not confined to its own lineage.

93
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
What's the process that's having the same effect

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
in cultural evolution

95
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
as sex is having in biological evolution?

96
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And I think the answer is exchange,

97
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
It's a unique human feature.

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
No other animal does it.

100
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --

102
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

103
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog

104
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."

105
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
(Laughter)

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
You can have culture without exchange.

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.

108
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.

109
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
They teach each other traditions

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
which are handed down from parent to offspring.

111
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other

112
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
how to crack nuts with rocks.

113
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
But the difference is

114
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
that these cultures never expand, never grow,

115
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
never accumulate, never become combinatorial,

116
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
and the reason is because

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
there is no sex, as it were,

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
there is no exchange of ideas.

119
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
There's no exchange of ideas between them.

121
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
And why does exchange raise living standards?

122
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.

123
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,

124
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

127
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

128
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
He doesn't need Adam.

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
He can make his own spears and axes.

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Well no, because if you think about it,

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
and then they trade,

133
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
then they will each have saved an hour of work.

134
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,

135
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes

136
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.

137
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,

139
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
is it actually creates the momentum

140
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
for more specialization,

141
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.

142
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.

143
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
That is prosperity, the saving of time

144
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
in satisfying your needs.

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Ask yourself how long you would have to work

146
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
to provide for yourself

147
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.

148
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.

149
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.

150
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.

151
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.

152
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
How long do you actually have to work

153
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
to earn an hour of reading light

154
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?

155
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
And the answer is about half a second.

156
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Back in 1950,

157
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage

158
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
to acquire that much light.

159
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained

160
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
since 1950, as it were,

161
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,

162
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
or you can acquire another good or service.

163
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
And back in 1880,

164
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
it would have been 15 minutes

165
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.

166
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Back in 1800,

167
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
you'd have had to work six hours

168
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.

169
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
In other words, the average person on the average wage

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
could not afford a candle in 1800.

171
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,

172
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
It was self-sufficiency.

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
We call that poverty these days.

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
But the object on the right

177
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
was made for me by other people.

178
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
How many other people?

179
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
You know, I think it's probably millions.

181
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,

182
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.

184
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
They were all working for me,

185
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
to make a mouse for me.

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
And that's the way society works.

187
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
That's what we've achieved as a species.

188
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
In the old days, if you were rich,

189
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
you literally had people working for you.

190
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.

191
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.

192
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
They made his silly outfits, like this,

193
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
(Laughter)

194
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.

195
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
He had 498 people

196
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
to prepare his dinner every night.

197
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles

198
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,

199
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.

200
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants

201
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
and shops all over Paris,

202
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal

203
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
that's probably got higher quality

204
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
than Louis XIV even had.

205
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.

206
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange

207
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
to raise each other's living standards.

208
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.

209
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.

210
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
But there's a big difference,

211
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
which is that it only happens within the colony.

212
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
There's no working for each other across the colonies.

213
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.

214
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.

215
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
The queen does it all.

216
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
In our species, we don't like doing that.

217
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
(Laughter)

219
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.

220
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,820
(Applause)

221
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
So when did this habit start?

222
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?

223
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
is probably the sexual division of labor.

225
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
But I've got no evidence for that.

226
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
It just looks like the first thing we did

227
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
was work male for female and female for male.

228
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
In all hunter-gatherer societies today,

229
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
there's a foraging division of labor

230
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.

231
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
It isn't always quite that simple,

232
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
but there's a distinction between

233
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
specialized roles for males and females.

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
And the beauty of this system

235
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
is that it benefits both sides.

236
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
The woman knows

237
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
that, in the Hadzas' case here --

238
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --

239
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein

240
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.

241
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt

242
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
and try and kill a warthog.

243
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging

244
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
to get roots.

245
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
it's big enough to share some.

247
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living

248
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
through the sexual division of labor.

249
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible

250
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
that Neanderthals didn't do this.

251
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
They were a highly cooperative species.

252
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
They were a highly intelligent species.

253
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine

254
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
in this room today.

255
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.

256
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
They had language, probably,

257
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,

258
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
which was discovered here in Oxford.

259
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.

260
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.

261
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
But there's no evidence

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
of a sexual division of labor.

263
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.

264
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.

265
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
And the other thing there's no evidence for

266
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
is exchange between groups,

267
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,

268
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
the tools they made,

269
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
are always made from local materials.

270
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
For example, in the Caucasus

271
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.

272
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
They're always made from local chert.

273
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
In the same valley there are modern human remains

274
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,

275
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
and some of those are from local chert,

276
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
but more -- but many of them are made

277
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
from obsidian from a long way away.

278
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
And when human beings began

279
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
moving objects around like this,

280
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.

281
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.

283
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Exchange between groups has been going on

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
for a hundred thousand years.

285
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
And the earliest evidence for it crops up

286
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,

287
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
when you see obsidian and jasper and other things

288
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
moving long distances in Ethiopia.

289
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
You also see seashells --

290
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
as discovered by a team here in Oxford --

291
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
moving 125 miles inland

292
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
from the Mediterranean in Algeria.

293
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
And that's evidence that people

294
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
have started exchanging between groups.

295
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
And that will have led to specialization.

296
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
How do you know that long-distance movement

297
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
means trade rather than migration?

298
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,

299
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,

300
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.

301
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
They traded them with their neighbors

302
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
for things like stingray barbs,

303
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
and the consequence was that stone axes

304
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
ended up over a large part of Australia.

305
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
So long-distance movement of tools

306
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
is a sign of trade, not migration.

307
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
What happens when you cut people off from exchange,

308
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
from the ability to exchange and specialize?

309
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And the answer is that

310
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
not only do you slow down technological progress,

311
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
you can actually throw it into reverse.

312
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
An example is Tasmania.

313
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,

314
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
the people on it not only experienced

315
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
slower progress than people on the mainland,

316
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
they actually experienced regress.

317
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
They gave up the ability to make stone tools

318
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
and fishing equipment and clothing

319
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
because the population of about 4,000 people

320
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
was simply not large enough

321
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
to maintain the specialized skills

322
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
necessary to keep the technology they had.

323
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.

324
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
How many of the things in our pockets

325
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
could we continue to make after 10,000 years?

326
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --

327
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
similar island, similar people.

328
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego

329
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,

330
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
and there was trading contact across that straight

331
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
throughout 10,000 years.

332
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
The Tasmanians were isolated.

333
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Go back to this image again

334
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,

335
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
but who knew how to make it.

336
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.

337
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?

338
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Nobody, literally nobody.

339
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.

340
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
I mean this quite seriously.

341
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.

342
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
He just knows how to run a company.

343
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
The person on the assembly line doesn't know

344
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well

345
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.

346
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.

347
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
I am of course quoting from a famous essay

348
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,

349
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
called "I, Pencil"

350
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,

351
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,

352
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,

353
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.

354
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
And what we've done in human society,

355
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
through exchange and specialization,

356
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
is we've created

357
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
the ability to do things that we don't even understand.

358
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
It's not the same with language.

359
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
With language we have to transfer ideas

360
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
that we understand with each other.

361
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
But with technology,

362
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.

363
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind

364
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
to an extraordinary degree.

365
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
And by the way,

366
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested

367
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
in the debate about I.Q.,

368
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.

369
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
It's completely irrelevant.

370
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
What's relevant to a society

371
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
is how well people are communicating their ideas,

372
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
and how well they're cooperating,

373
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
not how clever the individuals are.

374
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
So we've created something called the collective brain.

375
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
We're just the nodes in the network.

376
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
We're the neurons in this brain.

377
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
It's the interchange of ideas,

378
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
the meeting and mating of ideas between them,

379
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
that is causing technological progress,

380
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
incrementally, bit by bit.

381
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
However, bad things happen.

382
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
And in the future, as we go forward,

383
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
we will, of course, experience terrible things.

384
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
There will be wars; there will be depressions;

385
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
there will be natural disasters.

386
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.

387
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,

388
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
and the ability of ideas

389
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
to meet and to mate

390
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
as never before,

391
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I'm also sure

392
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
that technology will advance,

393
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
and therefore living standards will advance.

394
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Because through the cloud,

395
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
through crowd sourcing,

396
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
through the bottom-up world that we've created,

397
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
where not just the elites but everybody

398
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
is able to have their ideas

399
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
and make them meet and mate,

400
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

401
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Thank you.

402
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,820
(Applause)
