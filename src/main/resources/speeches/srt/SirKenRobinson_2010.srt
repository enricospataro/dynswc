1
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,978
I was here four years ago,

2
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,796
and I remember, at the time,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,339
that the talks weren't put online.

4
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:23,796
I think they were given
to TEDsters in a box,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,671
a box set of DVDs,

6
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:28,187
which they put on their shelves,
where they are now.

7
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,187
(Laughter)

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,797
And actually, Chris called me
a week after I'd given my talk, and said,

9
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:38,025
"We're going to start putting them online.
Can we put yours online?"

10
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,929
And I said, "Sure."

11
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,532
And four years later,

12
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:46,796
it's been downloaded four million times.

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,532
So I suppose you could multiply that
by 20 or something

14
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:52,604
to get the number
of people who've seen it.

15
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:56,732
And, as Chris says, there is
a hunger for videos of me.

16
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,829
(Laughter)

17
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,853
(Applause)

18
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:06,898
Don't you feel?

19
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:09,840
(Laughter)

20
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:15,421
So, this whole event
has been an elaborate build-up

21
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:18,084
to me doing another one
for you, so here it is.

22
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:19,595
(Laughter)

23
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:26,796
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference
I spoke at four years ago

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,522
and talked about the climate crisis.

25
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:32,617
And I referenced that
at the end of my last talk.

26
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,796
So I want to pick up from there

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,870
because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.

28
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:37,926
(Laughter)

29
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,796
So, as I was saying --

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,820
(Laughter)

31
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,142
You see, he's right.

32
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,796
I mean, there is a major
climate crisis, obviously,

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,916
and I think if people don't believe it,
they should get out more.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,116
(Laughter)

35
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:03,163
But I believe there is
a second climate crisis,

36
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,362
which is as severe,

37
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,796
which has the same origins,

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,242
and that we have to deal with
with the same urgency.

39
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:14,022
And you may say, by the way,

40
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,730
"Look, I'm good.

41
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:18,936
I have one climate crisis,
I don't really need the second one."

42
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:20,261
(Laughter)

43
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,658
But this is a crisis of,
not natural resources --

44
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,604
though I believe that's true --

45
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:26,828
but a crisis of human resources.

46
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:28,796
I believe fundamentally,

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,590
as many speakers have said
during the past few days,

48
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:36,060
that we make very poor use of our talents.

49
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,820
Very many people go
through their whole lives

50
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:41,796
having no real sense
of what their talents may be,

51
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,796
or if they have any to speak of.

52
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:45,930
I meet all kinds of people

53
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,518
who don't think
they're really good at anything.

54
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:52,945
Actually, I kind of divide the world
into two groups now.

55
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,373
Jeremy Bentham, the great
utilitarian philosopher,

56
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,796
once spiked this argument.

57
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,484
He said, "There are two types
of people in this world:

58
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,468
those who divide the world into two types

59
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,668
and those who do not."

60
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,692
(Laughter)

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,549
Well, I do.

62
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,573
(Laughter)

63
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:21,262
I meet all kinds of people
who don't enjoy what they do.

64
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,079
They simply go through their lives
getting on with it.

65
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,962
They get no great pleasure
from what they do.

66
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:30,459
They endure it rather than enjoy it,

67
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:31,926
and wait for the weekend.

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,715
But I also meet people

69
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,796
who love what they do
and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

70
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,627
If you said, "Don't do this anymore,"

71
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,648
they'd wonder what you're talking about.

72
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,748
It isn't what they do, it's who they are.

73
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,713
They say, "But this is me, you know.

74
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:48,642
It would be foolish to abandon this,

75
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,768
because it speaks
to my most authentic self."

76
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,923
And it's not true of enough people.

77
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,891
In fact, on the contrary, I think
it's still true of a minority of people.

78
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,796
And I think there are many
possible explanations for it.

79
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,207
And high among them is education,

80
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:08,605
because education, in a way,

81
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,152
dislocates very many people
from their natural talents.

82
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,565
And human resources
are like natural resources;

83
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,931
they're often buried deep.

84
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,091
You have to go looking for them,

85
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,282
they're not just lying around
on the surface.

86
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:24,510
You have to create the circumstances
where they show themselves.

87
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:28,034
And you might imagine
education would be the way that happens,

88
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,558
but too often, it's not.

89
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,133
Every education system in the world
is being reformed at the moment

90
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,430
and it's not enough.

91
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,564
Reform is no use anymore,

92
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:41,215
because that's simply improving
a broken model.

93
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:43,000
What we need --

94
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,793
and the word's been used
many times in the past few days --

95
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,571
is not evolution,

96
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:50,198
but a revolution in education.

97
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,796
This has to be transformed
into something else.

98
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,842
(Applause)

99
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,125
One of the real challenges
is to innovate fundamentally in education.

100
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:08,037
Innovation is hard,

101
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:11,257
because it means doing something
that people don't find very easy,

102
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,643
for the most part.

103
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:15,075
It means challenging
what we take for granted,

104
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,091
things that we think are obvious.

105
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:21,796
The great problem for reform
or transformation

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,835
is the tyranny of common sense.

107
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,014
Things that people think,

108
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:28,567
"It can't be done differently,
that's how it's done."

109
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:31,408
I came across a great quote recently
from Abraham Lincoln,

110
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,273
who I thought you'd be pleased
to have quoted at this point.

111
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,042
(Laughter)

112
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:42,327
He said this in December 1862
to the second annual meeting of Congress.

113
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:46,327
I ought to explain that I have no idea
what was happening at the time.

114
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,525
We don't teach
American history in Britain.

115
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,462
(Laughter)

116
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,796
We suppress it.
You know, this is our policy.

117
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,124
(Laughter)

118
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,528
No doubt, something fascinating
was happening then,

119
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:03,262
which the Americans among us
will be aware of.

120
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,174
But he said this:

121
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:13,621
"The dogmas of the quiet past
are inadequate to the stormy present.

122
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:18,399
The occasion
is piled high with difficulty,

123
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,801
and we must rise with the occasion."

124
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:23,403
I love that.

125
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,443
Not rise to it, rise with it.

126
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,012
"As our case is new,

127
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:34,116
so we must think anew and act anew.

128
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,796
We must disenthrall ourselves,

129
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,785
and then we shall save our country."

130
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,135
I love that word, "disenthrall."

131
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,636
You know what it means?

132
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,796
That there are ideas
that all of us are enthralled to,

133
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,853
which we simply take for granted
as the natural order of things,

134
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,249
the way things are.

135
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,923
And many of our ideas have been formed,

136
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,185
not to meet the circumstances
of this century,

137
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,876
but to cope with the circumstances
of previous centuries.

138
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,073
But our minds
are still hypnotized by them,

139
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,796
and we have to disenthrall ourselves
of some of them.

140
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,748
Now, doing this is easier said than done.

141
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,985
It's very hard to know, by the way,
what it is you take for granted.

142
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,804
And the reason
is that you take it for granted.

143
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:14,830
(Laughter)

144
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:17,188
Let me ask you something
you may take for granted.

145
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,381
How many of you here
are over the age of 25?

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,942
That's not what you take for granted,
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

147
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,796
Are there any people here
under the age of 25?

148
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,796
Great. Now, those over 25,

149
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,796
could you put your hands up
if you're wearing your wristwatch?

150
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,796
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?

151
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,813
Ask a room full of teenagers
the same thing.

152
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,455
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.

153
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,393
I don't mean they can't,

154
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,868
they just often choose not to.

155
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,861
And the reason is we were brought up
in a pre-digital culture,

156
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,096
those of us over 25.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,269
And so for us,
if you want to know the time,

158
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,239
you have to wear something to tell it.

159
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:56,962
Kids now live in a world
which is digitized,

160
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:58,796
and the time, for them, is everywhere.

161
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:00,538
They see no reason to do this.

162
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,811
And by the way, you don't need either;

163
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,804
it's just that you've always done it
and you carry on doing it.

164
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:09,073
My daughter never wears a watch,
my daughter Kate, who's 20.

165
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,490
She doesn't see the point.

166
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:12,301
As she says,

167
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,196
"It's a single-function device."

168
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,348
(Laughter)

169
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,039
"Like, how lame is that?"

170
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,956
And I say, "No, no,
it tells the date as well."

171
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,980
(Laughter)

172
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,423
"It has multiple functions."

173
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:31,796
(Laughter)

174
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,272
But, you see, there are things
we're enthralled to in education.

175
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,208
A couple of examples.

176
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,955
One of them is the idea of linearity:

177
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,615
that it starts here
and you go through a track

178
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,162
and if you do everything right,

179
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,813
you will end up set
for the rest of your life.

180
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,344
Everybody who's spoken at TED
has told us implicitly,

181
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,044
or sometimes explicitly,
a different story:

182
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,796
that life is not linear; it's organic.

183
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,290
We create our lives symbiotically

184
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:01,163
as we explore our talents

185
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,027
in relation to the circumstances
they help to create for us.

186
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,796
But, you know, we have become obsessed
with this linear narrative.

187
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,520
And probably the pinnacle for education
is getting you to college.

188
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,796
I think we are obsessed
with getting people to college.

189
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,521
Certain sorts of college.

190
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:19,449
I don't mean you shouldn't go,
but not everybody needs to go,

191
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:20,666
or go now.

192
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,322
Maybe they go later, not right away.

193
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,474
And I was up in San Francisco
a while ago doing a book signing.

194
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,297
There was this guy buying a book,
he was in his 30s.

195
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,591
I said, "What do you do?"

196
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,599
And he said, "I'm a fireman."

197
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,796
I asked, "How long
have you been a fireman?"

198
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,137
"Always. I've always been a fireman."

199
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,127
"Well, when did you decide?"
He said, "As a kid.

200
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:43,247
Actually, it was
a problem for me at school,

201
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:45,797
because at school,
everybody wanted to be a fireman."

202
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,835
(Laughter)

203
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,796
He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."

204
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:52,361
And he said, "When I got
to the senior year of school,

205
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,796
my teachers didn't take it seriously.

206
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,072
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.

207
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,143
He said I was throwing my life away

208
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,183
if that's all I chose to do with it;

209
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,513
that I should go to college, I should
become a professional person,

210
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,796
that I had great potential

211
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,950
and I was wasting my talent to do that."

212
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,388
He said, "It was humiliating.

213
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,998
It was in front of the whole class
and I felt dreadful.

214
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:14,529
But it's what I wanted,
and as soon as I left school,

215
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,851
I applied to the fire service
and I was accepted.

216
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,161
You know, I was thinking
about that guy recently,

217
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,376
just a few minutes ago when you
were speaking, about this teacher,

218
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,234
because six months ago, I saved his life."

219
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:28,865
(Laughter)

220
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,248
He said, "He was in a car wreck,
and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,

221
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,121
and I saved his wife's life as well."

222
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,011
He said, "I think he thinks
better of me now."

223
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:39,796
(Laughter)

224
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,630
(Applause)

225
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:47,551
You know, to me,

226
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:51,796
human communities depend
upon a diversity of talent,

227
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,276
not a singular conception of ability.

228
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,725
And at the heart of our challenges --

229
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,390
(Applause)

230
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:00,796
At the heart of the challenge

231
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,791
is to reconstitute our sense of ability
and of intelligence.

232
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,523
This linearity thing is a problem.

233
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:10,796
When I arrived in L.A.
about nine years ago,

234
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,949
I came across a policy statement --

235
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,236
very well-intentioned --

236
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,718
which said, "College
begins in kindergarten."

237
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,874
No, it doesn't.

238
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:25,629
(Laughter)

239
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,451
It doesn't.

240
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:30,646
If we had time,
I could go into this, but we don't.

241
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,884
(Laughter)

242
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,384
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.

243
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,718
(Laughter)

244
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,495
A friend of mine once said,

245
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,956
"A three year-old
is not half a six year-old."

246
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,796
(Laughter)

247
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,349
(Applause)

248
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,485
They're three.

249
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,509
But as we just heard in this last session,

250
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,796
there's such competition now
to get into kindergarten --

251
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,679
to get to the right kindergarten --

252
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:01,535
that people are being interviewed
for it at three.

253
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,733
Kids sitting in front
of unimpressed panels,

254
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,234
you know, with their resumes --

255
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,849
(Laughter)

256
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:12,147
Flicking through and saying,
"What, this is it?"

257
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:13,796
(Laughter)

258
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,139
(Applause)

259
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:20,119
"You've been around
for 36 months, and this is it?"

260
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:27,196
(Laughter)

261
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,974
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.

262
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,384
(Laughter)

263
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:33,209
Spent the first six months
breastfeeding, I can see."

264
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,892
(Laughter)

265
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,939
See, it's outrageous as a conception.

266
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,153
The other big issue is conformity.

267
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:46,796
We have built our education systems
on the model of fast food.

268
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,308
This is something Jamie Oliver
talked about the other day.

269
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,879
There are two models
of quality assurance in catering.

270
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,543
One is fast food,
where everything is standardized.

271
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,882
The other is like Zagat
and Michelin restaurants,

272
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,669
where everything is not standardized,

273
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,718
they're customized to local circumstances.

274
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:05,119
And we have sold ourselves
into a fast-food model of education,

275
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:08,218
and it's impoverishing
our spirit and our energies

276
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,063
as much as fast food is depleting
our physical bodies.

277
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:16,940
(Applause)

278
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,824
We have to recognize
a couple of things here.

279
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,196
One is that human talent
is tremendously diverse.

280
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,023
People have very different aptitudes.

281
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,796
I worked out recently
that I was given a guitar as a kid

282
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,796
at about the same time
that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.

283
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,424
(Laughter)

284
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,680
It worked out for Eric,
that's all I'm saying.

285
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:35,726
(Laughter)

286
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,837
In a way --

287
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,232
it did not for me.

288
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:41,797
I could not get this thing to work

289
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,353
no matter how often
or how hard I blew into it.

290
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,084
It just wouldn't work.

291
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,432
(Laughter)

292
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:51,099
But it's not only about that.

293
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,281
It's about passion.

294
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,878
Often, people are good at things
they don't really care for.

295
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,096
It's about passion,

296
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,796
and what excites
our spirit and our energy.

297
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,201
And if you're doing the thing
that you love to do, that you're good at,

298
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:05,495
time takes a different course entirely.

299
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,117
My wife's just finished writing a novel,

300
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,172
and I think it's a great book,

301
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,796
but she disappears for hours on end.

302
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,201
You know this, if you're doing
something you love,

303
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,110
an hour feels like five minutes.

304
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:21,811
If you're doing something
that doesn't resonate with your spirit,

305
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,426
five minutes feels like an hour.

306
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,134
And the reason so many people
are opting out of education

307
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,475
is because it doesn't feed their spirit,

308
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,277
it doesn't feed their energy
or their passion.

309
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,584
So I think we have to change metaphors.

310
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,654
We have to go from what is essentially
an industrial model of education,

311
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,479
a manufacturing model,

312
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,866
which is based on linearity
and conformity and batching people.

313
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:46,193
We have to move to a model

314
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,796
that is based more
on principles of agriculture.

315
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,083
We have to recognize

316
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:54,034
that human flourishing
is not a mechanical process;

317
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,987
it's an organic process.

318
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,597
And you cannot predict
the outcome of human development.

319
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:02,314
All you can do, like a farmer,
is create the conditions

320
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:04,511
under which they will begin to flourish.

321
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:08,360
So when we look at reforming
education and transforming it,

322
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,642
it isn't like cloning a system.

323
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,238
There are great ones,
like KIPP's; it's a great system.

324
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,101
There are many great models.

325
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,347
It's about customizing
to your circumstances

326
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:21,796
and personalizing education
to the people you're actually teaching.

327
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,521
And doing that, I think,
is the answer to the future

328
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:28,960
because it's not
about scaling a new solution;

329
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,301
it's about creating
a movement in education

330
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,796
in which people develop
their own solutions,

331
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,105
but with external support
based on a personalized curriculum.

332
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,796
Now in this room,

333
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,796
there are people who represent
extraordinary resources in business,

334
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,112
in multimedia, in the Internet.

335
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,796
These technologies,

336
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,586
combined with the extraordinary
talents of teachers,

337
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,463
provide an opportunity
to revolutionize education.

338
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,582
And I urge you to get involved in it

339
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:59,226
because it's vital, not just to ourselves,
but to the future of our children.

340
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,653
But we have to change
from the industrial model

341
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,328
to an agricultural model,

342
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:06,376
where each school can be
flourishing tomorrow.

343
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,248
That's where children experience life.

344
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,138
Or at home, if that's what they choose,

345
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,375
to be educated
with their families or friends.

346
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,550
There's been a lot of talk about dreams
over the course of these few days.

347
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:19,060
And I wanted to just very quickly --

348
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,989
I was very struck
by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,

349
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,298
recovering old poems.

350
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:26,164
I wanted to read you
a quick, very short poem

351
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:28,278
from W. B. Yeats,
who some of you may know.

352
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,689
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,

353
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,594
and he was bewailing the fact

354
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:38,868
that he couldn't really give her
what he thought she wanted from him.

355
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:42,288
And he says, "I've got something else,
but it may not be for you."

356
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,454
He says this:

357
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,200
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,

358
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:50,097
Enwrought with gold and silver light,

359
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:54,629
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

360
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,580
Of night and light and the half-light,

361
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,867
I would spread the cloths under your feet:

362
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,848
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

363
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:09,300
I have spread my dreams under your feet;

364
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,577
Tread softly

365
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,981
because you tread on my dreams."

366
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,461
And every day, everywhere,

367
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,674
our children spread
their dreams beneath our feet.

368
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,844
And we should tread softly.

369
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,082
Thank you.

370
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:28,740
(Applause)

371
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,143
Thank you very much.

372
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:34,185
(Applause)

373
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,224
Thank you.

374
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:38,248
(Applause)
