1
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:16,683
This is our life with bees,

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,406
and this is our life without bees.

3
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,874
Bees are the most important pollinators

4
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,683
of our fruits and vegetables and flowers

5
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:29,342
and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.

6
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:32,030
More than one third of the world's crop production

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,812
is dependent on bee pollination.

8
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:37,649
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there

9
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,566
pollinating our food intentionally.

10
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,437
They're out there because they need to eat.

11
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:46,156
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet

12
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,485
from pollen

13
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:50,421
and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.

14
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,186
They're flower-feeders,

15
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,120
and as they move from flower to flower,

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,591
basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,

17
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:02,046
they end up providing this valuable pollination service.

18
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,566
In parts of the world where there are no bees,

19
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,472
or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,

20
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:11,678
people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.

21
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:15,362
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower

22
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:17,261
with a paintbrush.

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,707
Now this business of hand pollination

24
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,793
is actually not that uncommon.

25
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:25,145
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers

26
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:27,802
with a hand-held vibrator.

27
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:31,746
Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)

28
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:37,026
Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower

29
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,806
is held very securely within

30
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:41,306
the male part of the flower, the anther,

31
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,680
and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,366
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world

33
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:51,489
that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,

34
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:54,081
and they do this by shaking their flight muscles

35
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:58,633
at a frequency similar to the musical note C.

36
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,219
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,

37
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,266
and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,

38
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:07,005
and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,

39
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,502
and she takes it home as food.

40
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:12,343
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies

41
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,874
inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes

42
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,237
because they get much more efficient pollination

43
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,732
when it's done naturally

44
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:22,294
and they get better quality tomatoes.

45
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,881
So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,

46
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,304
to care about bees.

47
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:31,476
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,

48
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:34,482
and they're absolutely gorgeous.

49
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,101
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle

50
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,921
hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem

51
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:42,621
and very few of these beautiful species

52
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,054
have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.

53
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:49,674
Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative

54
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:52,843
for the other 19,900-plus species

55
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:55,484
because there's something about honeybees

56
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:58,333
that draws people into their world.

57
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,780
Humans have been drawn to honeybees

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,496
since early recorded history,

59
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,972
mostly to harvest their honey,

60
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:07,431
which is an amazing natural sweetener.

61
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:09,219
I got drawn into the honeybee world

62
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,304
completely by a fluke.

63
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,626
I was 18 years old and bored,

64
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,488
and I picked up a book in the library on bees

65
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,730
and I spent the night reading it.

66
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,657
I had never thought about insects

67
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,380
living in complex societies.

68
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,782
It was like the best of science fiction come true.

69
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:28,676
And even stranger, there were these people,

70
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:32,667
these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,

71
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,970
and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.

72
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,455
So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,

73
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:42,652
a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.

74
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:46,059
And I was permanently hooked.

75
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,373
Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,

76
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,529
where the colony is the organism

77
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:54,261
and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000

78
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:57,189
individual bee organisms.

79
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,521
Now this society has no central authority.

80
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,117
Nobody's in charge.

81
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,462
So how they come to collective decisions,

82
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:07,442
and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,

83
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,924
how they communicate where the flowers are,

84
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:14,088
all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.

85
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,856
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,

86
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,801
is their system of healthcare.

87
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,286
So bees have social healthcare.

88
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:27,556
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.

89
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:29,895
For example, we study hygiene,

90
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,781
where some bees are able to locate and weed out

91
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,948
sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,

92
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,412
and it keeps the colony healthy.

93
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,839
And more recently, we've been studying resins

94
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,948
that bees collect from plants.

95
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:47,131
So bees fly to some plants and they scrape

96
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:49,787
these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,

97
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:51,365
and they take them back to the nest

98
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,231
where they cement them into the nest architecture

99
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,756
where we call it propolis.

100
00:04:56,756 --> 00:05:01,378
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.

101
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:03,322
It's a natural antibiotic.

102
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,501
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs

103
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,103
within the colony,

104
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:12,066
and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.

105
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:15,357
Humans have known about the power of propolis

106
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,004
since biblical times.

107
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:20,354
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies

108
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,406
for human medicine,

109
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,070
but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.

110
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,123
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses

111
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,812
that have kept them healthy and thriving

112
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:37,069
for over 50 million years.

113
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,418
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies

114
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:42,217
were reported to be dying en masse,

115
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,189
first in the United States,

116
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,002
it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.

117
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,488
In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,

118
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:54,674
we know we can't afford to lose bees.

119
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:57,789
So what's going on?

120
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,878
Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,

121
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,360
and I'll go through each of these.

122
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,213
The bottom line is,

123
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:10,265
bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape

124
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:13,754
and a dysfunctional food system.

125
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,746
Now we have the best data on honeybees,

126
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,602
so I'll use them as an example.

127
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:21,095
In the United States, bees in fact have been

128
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:23,959
in decline since World War II.

129
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,233
We have half the number of managed hives

130
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,247
in the United States now compared to 1945.

131
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:32,898
We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.

132
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:35,644
And the reason is, after World War II,

133
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:38,972
we changed our farming practices.

134
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:41,811
We stopped planting cover crops.

135
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,554
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,

136
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:48,400
which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,004
and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.

138
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:57,548
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.

139
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:01,002
And after World War II, we started using herbicides

140
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:03,499
to kill off the weeds in our farms.

141
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,280
Many of these weeds are flowering plants

142
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,213
that bees require for their survival.

143
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:14,784
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.

144
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,349
Now we talk about food deserts,

145
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,599
places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.

146
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,642
The very farms that used to sustain bees

147
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:28,398
are now agricultural food deserts,

148
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:30,821
dominated by one or two plant species

149
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,410
like corn and soybeans.

150
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,315
Since World War II, we have been systematically

151
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,214
eliminating many of the flowering plants

152
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:42,766
that bees need for their survival.

153
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,664
And these monocultures extend even to crops

154
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:48,211
that are good for bees, like almonds.

155
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:52,197
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,

156
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:55,208
hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,

157
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,140
and also because the pollen in an almond blossom

158
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,320
is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.

159
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,317
Now, the scale of almond monoculture

160
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:09,869
demands that most of our nation's bees,

161
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,605
over 1.5 million hives of bees,

162
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,597
be transported across the nation

163
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:17,948
to pollinate this one crop.

164
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:20,593
And they're trucked in in semi-loads,

165
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:22,923
and they must be trucked out,

166
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:25,662
because after bloom, the almond orchards

167
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:30,872
are a vast and flowerless landscape.

168
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,338
Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,

169
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:37,143
and we're planting more crops that need them.

170
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:41,327
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production

171
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:45,131
that requires bee pollination.

172
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:48,157
And then there's pesticides.

173
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:51,501
After World War II, we started using pesticides

174
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,065
on a large scale, and this became necessary

175
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:57,859
because of the monocultures that put out a feast

176
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,152
for crop pests.

177
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:03,093
Recently, researchers from Penn State University

178
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:06,390
have started looking at the pesticide residue

179
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,940
in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,

180
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,531
and they've found that every batch of pollen

181
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,538
that a honeybee collects

182
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:19,325
has at least six detectable pesticides in it,

183
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,368
and this includes every class of insecticides,

184
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,211
herbicides, fungicides,

185
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:29,791
and even inert and unlabeled ingredients

186
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,363
that are part of the pesticide formulation

187
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,585
that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.

188
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:42,227
This small bee is holding up a large mirror.

189
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:46,675
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?

190
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:49,655
One of these class of insecticides,

191
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,030
the neonicontinoids,

192
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,290
is making headlines around the world right now.

193
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,736
You've probably heard about it.

194
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,794
This is a new class of insecticides.

195
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:59,953
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,

196
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:01,396
a leaf-eating insect,

197
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:02,630
would take a bite of the plant

198
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,970
and get a lethal dose and die.

199
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,793
If one of these neonics, we call them,

200
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:11,247
is applied in a high concentration,

201
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,509
such as in this ground application,

202
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,977
enough of the compound moves through the plant

203
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:18,189
and gets into the pollen and the nectar,

204
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,293
where a bee can consume, in this case,

205
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,311
a high dose of this neurotoxin

206
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:27,460
that makes the bee twitch and die.

207
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,633
In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,

208
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:34,576
it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,

209
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:37,567
and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant

210
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,535
and gets into the pollen and nectar,

211
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:42,078
and if a bee consumes this lower dose,

212
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,420
either nothing happens

213
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,008
or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented

214
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:50,720
and she may not find her way home.

215
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,852
And on top of everything else, bees have

216
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,120
their own set of diseases and parasites.

217
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,980
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.

218
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,285
It's called varroa destructor.

219
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,389
It's aptly named.

220
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,001
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite

221
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,375
that compromises the bee's immune system

222
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,146
and circulates viruses.

223
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:12,075
Let me put this all together for you.

224
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,742
I don't know what it feels like to a bee

225
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,443
to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,

226
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,582
and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,

227
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:25,710
but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,

228
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,942
and I know how difficult it is for me to get

229
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,731
to the grocery store to get good nutrition.

230
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,777
But what if I lived in a food desert?

231
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,272
And what if I had to travel a long distance

232
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,145
to get to the grocery store,

233
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,019
and I finally got my weak body out there

234
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,163
and I consumed, in my food,

235
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,964
enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,

236
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,720
that I couldn't find my way home?

237
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,907
And this is what we mean by multiple

238
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:56,610
and interacting causes of death.

239
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,799
And it's not just our honeybees.

240
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,674
All of our beautiful wild species of bees

241
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:05,845
are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.

242
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,396
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.

243
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,446
They're providing the pollination insurance

244
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,064
alongside our honeybees.

245
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,487
We need all of our bees.

246
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,028
So what are we going to do?

247
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,442
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer

248
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,705
that we've created?

249
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:26,522
It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.

250
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:30,105
Every one of you out there can help bees

251
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:34,570
in two very direct and easy ways.

252
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,525
Plant bee-friendly flowers,

253
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,658
and don't contaminate these flowers,

254
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,320
this bee food, with pesticides.

255
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,654
So go online and search for flowers

256
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:49,066
that are native to your area and plant them.

257
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,189
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.

258
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,763
Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,

259
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:55,293
in your boulevards.

260
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:58,906
Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,

261
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,487
community spaces, meadows.

262
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,236
Set aside farmland.

263
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,936
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers

264
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,107
that blooms over the entire growing season,

265
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,001
from spring to fall.

266
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,699
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,

267
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,153
but also for migrating butterflies and birds

268
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:19,129
and other wildlife.

269
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,569
And we need to think carefully about putting back in

270
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,754
cover crops to nourish our soil

271
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,775
and nourish our bees.

272
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,038
And we need to diversify our farms.

273
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:35,820
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows

274
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,676
to disrupt the agricultural food desert

275
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:42,966
and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system

276
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,197
that we've created.

277
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:48,581
So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure

278
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:51,599
to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --

279
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:54,627
but when bees have access to good nutrition,

280
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,813
we have access to good nutrition

281
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:59,228
through their pollination services.

282
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,764
And when bees have access to good nutrition,

283
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:05,363
they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,

284
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:06,781
their healthcare,

285
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:10,879
that they have relied on for millions of years.

286
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,728
So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,

287
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:20,178
is that every one of us needs to behave

288
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:24,958
a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,

289
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,990
where each of our individual actions

290
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,096
can contribute to a grand solution,

291
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,783
an emergent property,

292
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,764
that's much greater than the mere sum

293
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,509
of our individual actions.

294
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,659
So let the small act of planting flowers

295
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,986
and keeping them free of pesticides

296
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:50,201
be the driver of large-scale change.

297
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:53,237
On behalf of the bees, thank you.

298
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:57,360
(Applause)

299
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,328
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.

300
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:04,484
The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,

301
00:15:04,484 --> 00:15:06,712
is there any sign of things bottoming out?

302
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:09,491
What's your hope/depression level on this?

303
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,105
Maria Spivak: Yeah.

304
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:12,058
At least in the United States,

305
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:14,410
an average of 30 percent of all bee hives

306
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,537
are lost every winter.

307
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,342
About 20 years ago,

308
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:20,678
we were at a 15-percent loss.

309
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,799
So it's getting precarious.

310
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,406
CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --
MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.

311
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,960
CA: Thirty percent a year.
MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies

312
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,610
and so they can maintain the same number,

313
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,931
they can recuperate some of their loss.

314
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,549
We're kind of at a tipping point.

315
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:38,418
We can't really afford to lose that many more.

316
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,238
We need to be really appreciative

317
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,591
of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.

318
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,741
CA: Thank you.

319
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:50,111
(Applause)
