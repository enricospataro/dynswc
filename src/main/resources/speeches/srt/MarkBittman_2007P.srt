1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I write about food. I write about cooking.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I take it quite seriously,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
but I'm here to talk about something

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,820
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
But I still think that this --

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,820
(Laughter)

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
-- may be this year's version of this.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,820
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
And why do I say it?

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Because only once before has the fate of individual people

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
and the fate of all of humanity

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
been so intertwined.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
There was the bomb, and there's now.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
And where we go from here is going to determine

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,820
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
we'd recognize it.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
It's a holocaust of a different kind,

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Start with the notion that global warming

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
is not only real, but dangerous.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
we can take this is a given.

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
Then hear this, please.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,820
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
to atmosphere-altering gases.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
is generated by livestock production --

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
more than transportation.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and it's not just methane.

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,820
air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
There's more.

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Like half the antibiotics in this country

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
are not administered to people, but to animals.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
if you're a progressive,

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
or you're looking for organic,

46
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
but it's all in the way we use these things.

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
There's another piece of the puzzle,

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and one you already know.

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --

53
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --

54
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
are diseases that are far more prevalent here

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
than anywhere in the rest of the world.

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,820
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,820
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,820
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,

60
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.

61
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,820
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.

62
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
Now global warming was unforeseen.

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,820
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.

64
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
but, you know, that's not such a big deal.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
The current health crisis, however,

67
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,820
is a little more the work of the evil empire.

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
We were told, we were assured,

69
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,

70
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
the healthier we'd be.

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,

72
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,

74
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.

76
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,820
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.

78
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.

79
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,820
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.

80
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Not bad.

81
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
But back to animals and junk food.

82
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
What do they have in common?

83
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
One: we don't need either of them for health.

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
We don't need animal products,

85
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.

86
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
Two: both have been marketed heavily,

87
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
creating unnatural demand.

88
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,820
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.

89
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies

90
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Now, let's imagine a parallel.

92
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,

93
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
knowing all the while that the result would be

95
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
pollution, war and rising costs.

96
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Incredible, isn't it?

97
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Yet they do that.

98
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And they do this here. It's the same deal.

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,

100
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
is that even when well-intentioned Feds

101
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
try to do right by us, they fail.

102
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,

103
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
or they are puppets of agribusiness.

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged

105
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,820
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,

106
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,820
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,

107
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,

108
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
along with more carbs.

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,

110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
and that plants and whole grains

111
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
should be supplanting eating junk food.

112
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.

113
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
And guess what?

114
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Half the people who developed the food pyramid

115
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
have ties to agribusiness.

116
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,

117
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
our swollen appetites simply became larger,

118
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.

119
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,820
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --

120
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
these are not solutions.

121
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
But with lots of intelligent people

122
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
focusing on whether food is organic or local,

123
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
or whether we're being nice to animals,

124
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.

125
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Now, don't get me wrong.

126
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
I like animals,

127
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production

128
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
and to churn them out like they were wrenches.

129
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
But there's no way to treat animals well,

130
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,820
when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
That's our number. 10 billion.

132
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
If you strung all of them --

133
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,820
chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,

134
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
they'd go there and back five times, there and back.

135
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,

136
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,

137
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
but you get the idea.

138
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
That's just the United States.

139
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals

140
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,

141
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.

142
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,820
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,

143
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,820
and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.

144
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"

145
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.

146
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Seriously.

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
And locavore, for those of you who don't know,

148
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
is someone who eats only locally grown food --

149
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
which is fine if you live in California,

150
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.

151
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
and the hip locavore vision,

153
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.

154
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
(Laughter).

155
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
They both get it wrong, though.

156
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,820
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.

157
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,820
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.

158
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
And I'm going to go through that,

159
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.

160
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
A hundred years ago, guess what?

161
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,

162
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

163
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.

164
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
And those moms bought and prepared food.

165
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.

166
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Margarine didn't exist.

167
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
In fact, when margarine was invented,

168
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,820
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,

169
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
so we'd all know that it was a fake.

170
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,

171
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.

172
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
There were no restaurant chains.

173
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,

174
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
but none of them would think to open another one.

175
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.

176
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
And fancy food was entirely French.

177
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
As an aside, those of you who remember

178
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations

179
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.

180
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
(Laughter)

181
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Back in those days, before even Julia,

182
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.

183
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
You just ate.

184
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
You didn't claim to be anything.

185
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.

186
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Vitamins had not been invented.

187
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.

188
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.

189
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
You ate food.

190
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

191
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
because it was an ingredient.

192
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
The cornflake hadn't been invented.

193
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
(Laughter)

194
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.

195
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Goldfish swam.

196
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
(Laughter)

197
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.

198
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
And again, everyone ate local.

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,

200
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
because it came all the way from Florida.

201
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,

202
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
trucks took the place of railroads,

203
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
fresh food began to travel more.

204
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Oranges became common in New York.

205
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
The South and West became agricultural hubs,

206
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.

207
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.

208
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,

209
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
as is almost everything

210
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
from the demise of the real community

211
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.

212
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,

213
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.

214
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Thus arrived convenience.

215
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives

216
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
as a way to cut down on housework.

217
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --

218
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
their mouths are watering at this point.

219
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
(Laughter)

220
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
(Applause)

221
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,820
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?

222
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
(Laughter)

223
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
But this may have cut down on housework,

224
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.

225
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable

226
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.

227
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --

228
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.

229
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.

230
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family

231
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
than broiling a steak?

232
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,820
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.

233
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,

234
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
for which their stomachs were designed,

235
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
they were forced to eat soy and corn.

236
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,

237
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
but that wasn't a problem for producers.

238
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
New drugs kept them healthy.

239
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Well, they kept them alive.

240
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Healthy was another story.

241
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Thanks to farm subsidies,

242
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,

243
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
soy, corn and cattle became king.

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.

245
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It was during this period that the cycle of

246
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
dietary and planetary destruction began,

247
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
the thing we're only realizing just now.

248
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Listen to this,

249
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,820
between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.

250
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Meat consumption increased five-fold.

251
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.

252
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.

253
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.

254
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,

255
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
because all of them could be bought at any store.

256
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Not that they were any good, but they were there.

257
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Most moms cooked like mine:

258
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,820
a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,

259
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
canned soup, canned fruit salad.

260
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,

261
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.

262
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,820
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.

263
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.

264
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,820
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.

265
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
(Laughter)

266
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
It wasn't all bad.

267
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
By the '70s, forward-thinking people

268
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.

269
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,

270
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
we knew or we were vegetarians.

271
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
We weren't all hippies, either.

272
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.

273
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.

274
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,

275
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
as if it were plastic,

276
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,820
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.

277
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Many people became fat-phobic.

278
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.

279
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.

280
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Instead they were sold on yogurt,

281
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.

282
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt

283
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.

284
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.

285
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
You think that that might be healthy food,

286
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,

287
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,820
it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.

288
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,

289
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
if not actually killed --

290
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,

291
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
which contained as many soy and corn products

292
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
as could be crammed into it.

293
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.

294
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,

295
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,820
and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,

296
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
and then it's fried in corn oil.

297
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?

298
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
And zapped horribly, pathetically.

299
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,820
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state

300
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
that the high fat and spice contents of foods

301
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --

302
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and we all have our favorites, actually --

303
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
made this stuff more appealing than the bland things

304
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
that people were serving at home.

305
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,820
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,

306
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
and cooking simply wasn't important enough

307
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
for men to share the burden.

308
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,

309
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
you've got your grazing nights,

310
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.

311
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?

312
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Meat, junk food, cheese:

313
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
the very stuff that will kill you.

314
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
So, now we clamor for organic food.

315
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
That's good.

316
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
And as evidence that things can actually change,

317
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
you can now find organic food in supermarkets,

318
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
and even in fast-food outlets.

319
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
But organic food isn't the answer either,

320
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
at least not the way it's currently defined.

321
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Let me pose you a question.

322
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Can farm-raised salmon be organic,

323
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,820
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,

324
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves

325
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,820
are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?

326
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there

327
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,

328
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?

329
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
I don't know.

330
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Packed in Styrofoam, of course,

331
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
before landing somewhere in the United States,

332
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.

333
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,820
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.

334
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Now here is where we all meet.

335
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,

336
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
the vegans, the gourmets

337
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,820
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.

338
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Even though we've come to this from different points,

339
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
we all have to act on our knowledge

340
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,820
to change the way that everyone thinks about food.

341
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
We need to start acting.

342
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --

343
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
and, of course, she's completely right --

344
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
but it's also one of global survival.

345
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,

346
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,820
the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.

347
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases

348
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
are attributed to livestock production.

349
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
How much livestock do you need to produce this?

350
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,

351
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,820
30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted

352
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
to raising the animals we'll eat.

353
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.

354
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
And if the numbers coming in from China

355
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
are anything like what they look like now,

356
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
it's not going to be 40 years.

357
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.

358
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,820
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.

359
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --

360
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein

361
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,820
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.

362
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,820
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction

363
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,820
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.

364
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.

365
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?

366
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Isn't meat eating essential to health?

367
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables

368
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?

369
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
(Laughter)

370
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.

371
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,820
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,

372
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
the answer is no.

373
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets

374
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,820
basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,

375
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
and many will make you much healthier than ours does.

376
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,

377
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,820
we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.

378
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health

379
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Americans eat 50 percent less meat --

380
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.

381
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,820
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,

382
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,820
and what progressive people, forward-thinking people

383
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
should be doing and advocating,

384
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.

385
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --

386
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.

387
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
During that time, I've eaten

388
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,820
and recommended eating just about everything.

389
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,

390
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,

391
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
the time has come to stop raising them industrially

392
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
and stop eating them thoughtlessly.

393
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Ann Cooper's right.

394
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,820
The USDA is not our ally here.

395
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
We have to take matters into our own hands,

396
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --

397
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,820
and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.

398
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
And that happens to be quite easy.

399
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Less meat, less junk, more plants.

400
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
It's a simple formula: eat food.

401
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Eat real food.

402
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,

403
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
and we can eat even better.

404
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,

405
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,820
and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.

406
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.

407
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
We can make food more important, not less,

408
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
and save ourselves by doing so.

409
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,820
We have to choose that path.

410
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
Thank you.
