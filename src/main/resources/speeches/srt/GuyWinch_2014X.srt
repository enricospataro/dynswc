1
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:18,361
I grew up with my identical twin,

2
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,528
who was an incredibly loving brother.

3
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:25,935
Now, one thing about being a twin 
is that it makes you an expert

4
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,550
at spotting favoritism.

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,320
If his cookie was even slightly bigger 
than my cookie, I had questions.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,740
And clearly, I wasn't starving.

7
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,775
(Laughter)

8
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:46,223
When I became a psychologist, I began to
notice favoritism of a different kind,

9
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:52,103
and that is how much more we
value the body than we do the mind.

10
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:58,160
I spent nine years at university earning
my doctorate in psychology,

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,580
and I can't tell you how many people 
look at my business card and say,

12
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:07,124
"Oh, a psychologist. 
So not a real doctor,"

13
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:10,601
as if it should say that on my card.

14
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:15,192
(Laughter)

15
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:20,755
This favoritism we show the body 
over the mind, I see it everywhere.

16
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,229
I recently was at a friend's house,

17
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,029
and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed.

18
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:29,802
He was standing on a stool 
by the sink brushing his teeth,

19
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:33,481
when he slipped, and scratched his leg 
on the stool when he fell.

20
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,217
He cried for a minute, 
but then he got back up,

21
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:43,363
got back on the stool, and reached out for
a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut.

22
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:47,212
Now, this kid could barely 
tie his shoelaces,

23
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:51,410
but he knew you have to cover a cut,
so it doesn't become infected,

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,245
and you have to care for
your teeth by brushing twice a day.

25
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:58,189
We all know how to maintain
our physical health

26
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,728
and how to practice dental hygiene, right?

27
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:04,818
We've known it since
we were five years old.

28
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:09,466
But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health?

29
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,598
Well, nothing.

30
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,388
What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene?

31
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,077
Nothing.

32
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:23,059
How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth

33
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,205
than we do our minds.

34
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:30,502
Why is it that our physical health is
so much more important to us

35
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:33,213
than our psychological health?

36
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:38,539
We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones,

37
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:43,303
injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness.

38
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,875
And they can also get
worse if we ignore them,

39
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,105
and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways.

40
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:53,191
And yet, even though there are 
scientifically proven techniques

41
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,560
we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries,

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,952
we don't.

43
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:02,254
It doesn't even occur to us 
that we should.

44
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:06,767
"Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head."

45
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:10,035
Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg:

46
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:13,299
"Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg."

47
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,268
(Laughter)

48
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:20,921
It is time we closed the gap between
our physical and our psychological health.

49
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,017
It's time we made them more equal,

50
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,883
more like twins.

51
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,529
Speaking of which, 
my brother is also a psychologist.

52
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,717
So he's not a real doctor, either.

53
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,469
(Laughter)

54
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:37,524
We didn't study together, though.

55
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:41,665
In fact, the hardest thing 
I've ever done in my life

56
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:44,651
is move across the Atlantic 
to New York City

57
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,637
to get my doctorate in psychology.

58
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,623
We were apart then
for the first time in our lives,

59
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:54,115
and the separation was 
brutal for both of us.

60
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:57,284
But while he remained among
family and friends,

61
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,500
I was alone in a new country.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,966
We missed each other terribly,

63
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:05,293
but international phone calls were
really expensive then

64
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:09,619
and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week.

65
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:12,223
When our birthday rolled around,

66
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,660
it was the first we wouldn't
be spending together.

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,111
We decide to splurge, and that week
we would talk for 10 minutes.

68
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:23,029
I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call --

69
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:29,512
and waiting and waiting, 
but the phone didn't ring.

70
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,987
Given the time difference, I assumed,

71
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:34,628
"Ok, he's out with friends, 
he will call later."

72
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,673
There were no cell phones then.

73
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,858
But he didn't.

74
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:43,843
And I began to realize that after 
being away for over 10 months,

75
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:47,653
he no longer missed me 
the way I missed him.

76
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,529
I knew he would call in the morning,

77
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:56,405
but that night was one of the
saddest and longest nights of my life.

78
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:58,682
I woke up the next morning.

79
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:02,957
I glanced down at the phone, and 
I realized I had kicked it off the hook

80
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,433
when pacing the day before.

81
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,296
I stumbled out off bed,

82
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:11,453
I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later,

83
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:15,426
and it was my brother,
and, boy, was he pissed.

84
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:17,348
(Laughter)

85
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:20,788
It was the saddest and longest 
night of his life as well.

86
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,380
Now I tried to explain what
happened, but he said,

87
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,408
"I don't understand. 
If you saw I wasn't calling you,

88
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:31,219
why didn't you just pick up 
the phone and call me?"

89
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:35,364
He was right. Why didn't I call him?

90
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:38,407
I didn't have an answer then,
but I do today,

91
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:43,462
and it's a simple one: loneliness.

92
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:47,746
Loneliness creates a
deep psychological wound,

93
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:51,703
one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking.

94
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:57,342
It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do.

95
00:05:57,342 --> 00:06:00,172
It make us really afraid to reach out,

96
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:03,622
because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache

97
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:08,094
when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand?

98
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:11,358
I was in the grips of real 
loneliness back then,

99
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:15,859
but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me.

100
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:20,514
But loneliness is defined 
purely subjectively.

101
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,359
It depends solely on whether you feel

102
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:26,934
emotionally or socially disconnected
from those around you.

103
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,719
And I did.

104
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:35,183
There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying.

105
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:39,335
Loneliness won't just make you
miserable, it will kill you.

106
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:40,753
I'm not kidding.

107
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:44,487
Chronic loneliness increases your 
likelihood of an early death

108
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,478
by 14 percent.

109
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,501
Loneliness causes high blood pressure,
high cholesterol.

110
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:56,377
It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system,

111
00:06:56,377 --> 00:07:00,628
making you vulnerable to all kinds 
of illnesses and diseases.

112
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,189
In fact, scientists have concluded 
that taken together,

113
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,810
chronic loneliness poses as 
significant a risk

114
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,201
for your longterm health and 
longevity as cigarette smoking.

115
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,853
Now cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you."

116
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,225
But loneliness doesn't.

117
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:23,727
And that's why it's so important that
we prioritize our psychological health,

118
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:27,130
that we practice emotional hygiene.

119
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,102
Because you can't treat 
a psychological wound

120
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:33,332
if you don't even know you're injured.

121
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,764
Loneliness isn't the only 
psychological wound

122
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:40,232
that distorts our perceptions 
and misleads us.

123
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:43,638
Failure does that as well.

124
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,820
I once visited a day care center,

125
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,024
where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys.

126
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:55,724
You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out.

127
00:07:55,725 --> 00:08:00,375
One little girl tried pulling the
purple button, then pushing it,

128
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,737
and then she just sat back and looked 
at the box, with her lower lip trembling.

129
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,924
The little boy next to her 
watched this happen,

130
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:13,184
then turned to his box and and burst 
into tears without even touching it.

131
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:16,427
Meanwhile, another little girl tried 
everything she could think of

132
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,235
until she slid the red button,

133
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:22,352
the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight.

134
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:25,745
So three toddlers with 
identical plastic toys,

135
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:29,777
but with very different 
reactions to failure.

136
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:34,098
The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button.

137
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,410
The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding

138
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,740
was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not.

139
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,790
Now, adults get tricked this way 
as well, all the time.

140
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,229
In fact, we all have a default set of 
feelings and beliefs that gets triggered

141
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:55,405
whenever we encounter 
frustrations and setbacks.

142
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:58,524
Are you aware of how 
your mind reacts to failure?

143
00:08:58,524 --> 00:08:59,853
You need to be.

144
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:04,134
Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something

145
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,783
and you believe it,

146
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:09,081
then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless

147
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,679
and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all.

148
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,787
And then you'll be even more 
convinced you can't succeed.

149
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:20,405
You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential.

150
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:24,079
Because somewhere along the way, 
sometimes a single failure

151
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,709
convinced them that they couldn't 
succeed, and they believed it.

152
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:33,786
Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind.

153
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:37,851
I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother.

154
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,210
We were driving with friends 
down a dark road at night,

155
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,752
when a police car stopped us.

156
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,164
There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects.

157
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:50,107
The officer approached the car, and he
shined his flashlight on the driver,

158
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:54,391
then on my brother in the front seat,
and then on me.

159
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,594
And his eyes opened wide and he said,

160
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,797
"Where have I seen your face before?"

161
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,895
(Laughter)

162
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:05,616
And I said, "In the front seat."

163
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:08,127
(Laughter)

164
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,633
But that made no sense
to him whatsoever.

165
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,957
So now he thought I was on drugs.

166
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,091
(Laughter)

167
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,615
So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me,

168
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,620
he marches me over to the police car,

169
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,585
and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record,

170
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:26,051
could I show him 
I had a twin in the front seat.

171
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,468
But even as we were driving away, 
you could see by the look on his face

172
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:34,474
he was convinced that I was
getting away with something.

173
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:38,489
Our mind is hard to change 
once we become convinced.

174
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:43,251
So it might be very natural to feel
demoralized and defeated after you fail.

175
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:48,062
But you cannot allow yourself to become 
convinced you can't succeed.

176
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:50,652
You have to fight 
feelings of helplessness.

177
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:54,213
You have to gain control
over the situation.

178
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:58,721
And you have to break this kind of 
negative cycle before it begins.

179
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,356
Our minds and our feelings,

180
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:05,461
they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were.

181
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,186
They are more like a really moody friend,

182
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:13,631
who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next.

183
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,506
I once worked with this woman

184
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:19,793
who after 20 years marriage
and an extremely ugly divorce,

185
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:22,146
was finally ready for her first date.

186
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:26,778
She had met this guy online, and he
seemed nice and he seemed successful,

187
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:30,333
and most importantly, 
he seemed really into her.

188
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,404
So she was very excited, 
she bought a new dress,

189
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:37,487
and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink.

190
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:41,058
Ten minutes into the date, 
the man stands up and says,

191
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:45,138
"I'm not interested," and walks out.

192
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,392
Rejection is extremely painful.

193
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:53,837
The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. 
All she could do was call a friend.

194
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:58,569
Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect?

195
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:02,042
You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say,

196
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,666
why would a handsome, 
successful man like that

197
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,750
ever go out with a loser like you?"

198
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,845
Shocking, right, that a friend 
could be so cruel?

199
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,500
But it would be much less shocking

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,377
if I told you it wasn't 
the friend who said that.

201
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:20,332
It's what the woman said to herself.

202
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:24,830
And that's something we all do, 
especially after a rejection.

203
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,377
We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings,

204
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,611
what we wish we were, 
what we wish we weren't,

205
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,989
we call ourselves names.

206
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:35,349
Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.

207
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:40,200
And it's interesting that we do, because
our self-esteem is already hurting.

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,160
Why would we want to go 
and damage it even further?

209
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,801
We wouldn't make a physical injury 
worse on purpose.

210
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,730
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm 
and decide, "Oh, I know!

211
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,339
I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it."

212
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,793
But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time.

213
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:59,485
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.

214
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:02,207
Because we don't prioritize 
our psychological health.

215
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:06,070
We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower,

216
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,743
you are more vulnerable to 
stress and to anxiety,

217
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:14,966
that failures and rejections hurt more
and it takes longer to recover from them.

218
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:18,145
So when you get rejected, 
the first thing you should be doing

219
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:24,374
is to revive your self-esteem, not 
join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.

220
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,279
When you're in emotional pain,

221
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,392
treat yourself with the same compassion 
you would expect from a truly good friend.

222
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:39,378
We have to catch our unhealthy 
psychological habits and change them.

223
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:44,048
One of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination.

224
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,809
To ruminate means to chew over.

225
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:51,180
It's when your boss yells at you, or your 
professor makes you feel stupid in class,

226
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,371
or you have big fight with a friend

227
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:57,788
and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days,

228
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,757
sometimes for weeks on end.

229
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:05,465
Ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit,

230
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,553
and it's a very costly one.

231
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:11,742
Because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts,

232
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:14,714
you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk

233
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:19,246
for developing clinical depression, 
alcoholism, eating disorders,

234
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:21,969
and even cardiovascular disease.

235
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:27,839
The problem is the urge to ruminate can
feel really strong and really important,

236
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,249
so it's a difficult habit to stop.

237
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,621
I know this for a fact, 
because a little over a year ago,

238
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:36,170
I developed the habit myself.

239
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,649
You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage III non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

240
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,953
His cancer was extremly aggressive.

241
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:48,724
He had visible tumors all over his body.

242
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:53,655
And he had to start
a harsh course of chemotherapy.

243
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:58,317
And I couldn't stop thinking about 
what he was going through.

244
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:01,552
I couldn't stop thinking about 
how much he was suffering,

245
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:06,152
even though he never complained, not once.

246
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,570
He had this incredibly positive attitude.

247
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,199
His psychological health was amazing.

248
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,338
I was physically healthy, 
but psychologically I was a mess.

249
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,568
But I knew what to do.

250
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:22,730
Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient

251
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,788
to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment.

252
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:29,285
And so each time I had a worrying, 
upsetting, negative thought,

253
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:34,077
I forced myself to concentrate on
something else until the urge passed.

254
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:38,423
And within one week, 
my whole outlook changed

255
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:41,933
and became more positive 
and more hopeful.

256
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,444
Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan,

257
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:51,080
and I was by his side when 
he got the results.

258
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,317
All the tumors were gone.

259
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:56,934
He still had three more rounds 
of chemotherapy to go,

260
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,551
but we knew he would recover.

261
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:03,799
This picture was taken two weeks ago.

262
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,667
By taking action when you're lonely,

263
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,045
by changing your responses to failure,

264
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,977
by protecting your self-esteem,

265
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,009
by battling negative thinking,

266
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,707
you won't just heal your
psychological wounds,

267
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:23,389
you will build emotional resilience,
you will thrive.

268
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,614
A hundred years ago, 
people began practicing personal hygiene,

269
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,939
and life expectancy rates rose 
by over 50 percent

270
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,397
in just a matter of decades.

271
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:39,742
I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically

272
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:43,389
if we all began practicing 
emotional hygiene.

273
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,582
Can you imagine what
the world would be like

274
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:48,908
if everyone was psychologically healthier?

275
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,203
If there were less loneliness 
and less depression?

276
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,044
If people knew how to overcome failure?

277
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:58,094
If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered?

278
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:01,340
If they were happier and more fulfilled?

279
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,653
I can, because that's the world
I want to live in,

280
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:10,239
and that's the world my brother
wants to live in as well.

281
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,320
And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits,

282
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,202
well, that's the world we can all live in.

283
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:20,114
Thank you very much.

284
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:23,087
(Applause)
