1
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,671
This is a map of New York State

2
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:18,213
that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.

3
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:21,734
It's an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,

4
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:24,479
because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,

5
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,382
there is a little town called Roscoe --

6
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:29,104
actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here --

7
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:32,658
There's Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,

8
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:36,495
and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

9
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,578
Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,

10
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,878
because it's a paper town.

11
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,124
It's also known as a copyright trap.

12
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:47,502
Mapmakers -- because my map of New York
and your map of New York

13
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:51,192
are going to look very similar,
on account of the shape of New York --

14
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:55,989
often, mapmakers will insert
fake places onto their maps,

15
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,775
in order to protect their copyright.

16
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,687
Because then, if my fake place
shows up on your map,

17
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:04,366
I can be well and truly sure
that you have robbed me.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,031
Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
of the two guys who made this map,

19
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:11,976
Ernest G. Alpers and Otto Lindberg,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,276
and they released this map in 1937.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,619
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map

22
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:22,667
with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection

23
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,959
of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.

24
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:29,286
Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,522
They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,

26
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:36,140
"We've caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.

27
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,218
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.

28
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:39,943
We're going to sue your pants off!"

29
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:45,310
And Rand McNally says,
"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."

30
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,980
Because people kept going
to that intersection of two dirt roads --

31
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,028
(Laughter)

32
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:56,548
in the middle of nowhere, expecting
there to be a place called Agloe --

33
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:59,805
someone built a place
called Agloe, New York.

34
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,868
(Laughter)

35
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:04,273
It had a gas station, a general store,
two houses at its peak.

36
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:06,567
(Laughter)

37
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:11,894
And this is of course a completely
irresistible metaphor to a novelist,

38
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:16,529
because we would all like to believe
that the stuff that we write down on paper

39
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,345
can change the actual world
in which we're actually living,

40
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:21,758
which is why my third book
is called "Paper Towns".

41
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:26,321
But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,

42
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,726
is the phenomenon itself.

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,418
It's easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?

44
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:37,869
Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.

45
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,638
But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way

46
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,203
that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.

47
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:50,383
Because the world would truly be
a different place if North were down.

48
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,585
And the world would be
a truly different place

49
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:55,628
if Alaska and Russia weren't
on opposite sides of the map.

50
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,578
And the world would be a different place

51
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:00,762
if we projected Europe
to show it in its actual size.

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,903
The world is changed
by our maps of the world.

53
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,085
The way that we choose -- sort of,
our personal cartographic enterprise,

54
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,744
also shapes the map of our lives,

55
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,886
and that in turn shapes our lives.

56
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,565
I believe that what we map
changes the life we lead.

57
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:25,003
And I don't mean that in some, like,
secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,

58
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,997
you-can-think-your-way-
out-of-cancer sense.

59
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:34,554
But I do believe that while maps don't
show you where you will go in your life,

60
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,569
they show you where you might go.

61
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:41,066
You very rarely go to a place
that isn't on your personal map.

62
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:44,788
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.

63
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:47,484
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.

64
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,116
And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,295
is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles

66
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,476
that had been erected before me,

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,127
and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.

68
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,635
And I didn't really want
to jump over these hurdles,

69
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,593
because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,

70
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:07,694
and then people would
threaten me, you know,

71
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,647
they'd threaten me with this
"going on [my] permanent record,"

72
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,880
or "You'll never get a good job."

73
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,383
I didn't want a good job!

74
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:17,419
As far as I could tell at eleven
or twelve years old,

75
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:20,595
like, people with good jobs woke up
very early in the morning,

76
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,624
(Laughter)

77
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:27,220
and the men who had good jobs,
one of the first things they did

78
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:31,167
was tie a strangulation item
of clothing around their necks.

79
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,792
They literally put nooses on themselves,

80
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,542
and then they went off to their jobs,
whatever they were.

81
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,305
That's not a recipe for a happy life.

82
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,657
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
twelve year-old imagination --

83
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,240
these people who are strangling themselves

84
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,620
as one of the first things
they do each morning,

85
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,404
they can't possibly be happy.

86
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,840
Why would I want to jump
over all of these hurdles

87
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,864
and have that be the end?

88
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,055
That's a terrible end!

89
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:00,452
And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,

90
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:03,238
Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,

91
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,072
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.

92
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,611
And all at once I became a learner.

93
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,831
And I became a learner,
because I found myself

94
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,879
in a community of learners.

95
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,666
I found myself surrounded by people

96
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,920
who celebrated intellectualism
and engagement,

97
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:22,117
and who thought that my ironic
oh-so-cool disengagement

98
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,995
wasn't clever, or funny,

99
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,781
but, like, it was a simple
and unspectacular response

100
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,079
to very complicated
and compelling problems.

101
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,005
And so I started to learn,
because learning was cool.

102
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:36,332
I learned that some infinite sets
are bigger than other infinite sets,

103
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:40,450
and I learned that iambic pentameter is
and why it sounds so good to human ears.

104
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,916
I learned that the Civil War
was a nationalizing conflict,

105
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,107
I learned some physics,

106
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:48,287
I learned that correlation shouldn't be
confused with causation --

107
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,104
all of these things, by the way,

108
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:54,380
enriched my life
on a literally daily basis.

109
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,990
And it's true that I don't use
most of them for my "job,"

110
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,928
but that's not what it's about for me.

111
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,903
It's about cartography.

112
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,188
What is the process of cartography?

113
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:07,373
It's, you know, sailing
upon some land, and thinking,

114
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,498
"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"

115
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,845
and then wondering, "Maybe there's
some more land to draw."

116
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:15,076
And that's when learning
really began for me.

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,736
It's true that I had teachers
that didn't give up on me,

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,078
and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,

119
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:24,276
because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.

120
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,850
But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school

121
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:31,053
wasn't about what happened
inside the classroom,

122
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,535
it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.

123
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,916
For instance, I can tell you

124
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,773
that "There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons --

125
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,250
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --"

126
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,590
not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school

127
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:44,890
when I was in high school,

128
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,509
but because there was a girl
when I was in high school,

129
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,020
and her name was Amanda,
and I had a crush on her,

130
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,418
and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.

131
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:55,126
The reason I can tell you
what opportunity cost is,

132
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,802
is because one day when I was playing
Super Mario Kart on my couch,

133
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:00,698
my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,

134
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:03,080
"How long have you been playing
Super Mario Kart?"

135
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:06,574
And I said, "I don't know,
like, six hours?" and he said,

136
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,966
"Do you realize that if you'd worked
at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,

137
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,248
you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,

138
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:15,192
you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart."

139
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,474
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."

140
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,847
(Laughter)

141
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:23,796
But I learned what opportunity cost is.

142
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,581
And along the way, the map
of my life got better.

143
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,462
It got bigger; it contained more places.

144
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:33,451
There were more things that might happen,

145
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,434
more futures I might have.

146
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:39,769
It wasn't a formal, organized
learning process,

147
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,524
and I'm happy to admit that.

148
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,680
It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.

149
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,998
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea

150
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,855
that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,

151
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,776
but I didn't really understand
the calculus behind that idea.

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,815
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,

153
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,149
but I didn't know the law
of diminishing returns.

154
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:00,146
But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,

155
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,258
instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles

156
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,640
that you have to jump over,

157
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:07,136
is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,597
And so now I do know
at least some of the calculus

159
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,353
that underlies all of that stuff.

160
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,147
So, I had one learning community

161
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,785
in high school, then I went
to another for college,

162
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,109
and then I went to another,

163
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,729
when I started working
at a magazine called "Booklist,"

164
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:23,106
where I was an assistant, surrounded
by astonishingly well-read people.

165
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,656
And then I wrote a book.

166
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
And like all authors dream of doing,

167
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,833
I promptly quit my job.

168
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,446
(Laughter)

169
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,446
And for the first time since high school,

170
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,073
I found myself without a learning
community, and it was miserable.

171
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,531
I hated it.

172
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,929
I read many, many books
during this two-year period.

173
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,716
I read books about Stalin,

174
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,231
and books about how the Uzbek people
came to identify as Muslims,

175
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:49,605
and I read books about
how to make atomic bombs,

176
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,778
but it just felt like I was
creating my own hurdles,

177
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:56,158
and then jumping over them myself,
instead of feeling the excitement

178
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,831
of being part of a community of learners,
a community of people

179
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,838
who are engaged together
in the cartographic enterprise

180
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:06,418
of trying to better understand
and map the world around us.

181
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,888
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.

182
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,063
His name is Ze Frank.

183
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,724
I didn't actually meet him,
just on the Internet.

184
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:19,278
Ze Frank was running, at the time,
a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"

185
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:20,776
and I discovered the show,

186
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,034
and that was my way back
into being a community learner again.

187
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:26,213
Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:

188
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:31,162
(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
in the middle of a huge, hot desert.

189
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:33,882
Almost everything here was brought
from somewhere else --

190
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,082
the sort of rocks, the trees,
the waterfalls.

191
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:39,115
These fish are almost as out of place
as my pig that flew.

192
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,005
Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,

193
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,183
so are these people.

194
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:47,138
Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,

195
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,910
and away from the people
that experience them differently.

196
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:53,114
Sometimes improvements were made --
even the Sphinx got a nose job.

197
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:56,029
Here, there's no reason to feel
like you're missing anything.

198
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,023
This New York means the same to me
as it does to everyone else.

199
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,604
Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:

200
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,558
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.

201
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:08,180
This fabrication of place could be one
of the world's greatest achievements,

202
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,225
because no one belongs here;
everyone does.

203
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:13,273
As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings

204
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:16,037
were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.

205
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:17,222
But unlike most mirrors,

206
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:20,621
which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,

207
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:22,090
these mirrors come back empty.

208
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,293
John Green: Makes me
nostalgic for the days

209
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,499
when you could see
the pixels in online video.

210
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:27,530
(Laughter)

211
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:31,640
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
he's also a brilliant community builder,

212
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,525
and the community of people
that built up around these videos

213
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,561
was in many ways a community of learners.

214
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:40,109
So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.

215
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:44,546
We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.

216
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,521
We turned the Earth into a sandwich,

217
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,254
by having one person hold a piece of bread
at one point on the Earth,

218
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,407
and on the exact opposite
point of the Earth,

219
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,943
have another person
holding a piece of bread.

220
00:10:55,413 --> 00:11:01,421
I realize that these are silly ideas,
but they are also "learny" ideas,

221
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,367
and that was what was so exciting to me,

222
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,981
and if you go online, you can find
communities like this all over the place.

223
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,886
Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,

224
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,561
and yes, you will see people
complaining about calculus,

225
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,255
but you'll also see people
re-blogging those complaints,

226
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,463
making the argument that calculus
is interesting and beautiful,

227
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:21,440
and here's a way in to thinking about
the problem that you find unsolvable.

228
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:24,060
You can go to places like Reddit,
and find sub-Reddits,

229
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,702
like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"

230
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,957
where you can ask people
who are in these fields

231
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,449
a wide range of questions,

232
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,814
from very serious ones to very silly ones.

233
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:36,770
But to me, the most interesting
communities of learners

234
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:39,657
that are growing up on the Internet
right now are on YouTube,

235
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,277
and admittedly, I am biased.

236
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:45,835
But I think in a lot of ways,
the YouTube page resembles a classroom.

237
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,683
Look for instance at "Minute Physics,"

238
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,500
a guy who's teaching
the world about physics:

239
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:52,025
(Video) Let's cut to the chase.

240
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,407
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
is the last fundamental piece

241
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,911
of the standard model of particle physics
to be discovered experimentally.

242
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,989
But, you might ask,
why was the Higgs boson

243
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,499
included in the standard model,

244
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,793
alongside well-known particles
like electrons and photons and quarks,

245
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,337
if it hadn't been discovered
back then in the 1970s?

246
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,361
Good question. There are two main reasons.

247
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:13,644
First, just like the electron
is an excitation in the electron field,

248
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:16,462
the Higgs boson is simply a particle
which is an excitation

249
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,469
of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.

250
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,737
The Higgs field in turn
plays an integral role

251
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,690
in our model for the weak nuclear force.

252
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:25,874
In particular, the Higgs field
helps explain why it's so weak.

253
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,962
We'll talk more about this
in a later video,

254
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:31,820
but even though weak nuclear theory was
confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,

255
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:35,556
the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
with the weak force, that until now

256
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,747
we've been unable to confirm
its actual and independent existence.

257
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,546
JG: Or here's a video that I made

258
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,779
as part of my show "Crash Course,"
talking about World War I:

259
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:47,174
(Video) The immediate cause was
of course the assassination in Sarajevo

260
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,209
of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

261
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:53,659
on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.

262
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,125
Quick aside: It's worth noting

263
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,641
that the first big war
of the twentieth century began

264
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:58,886
with an act of terrorism.

265
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,241
So Franz Ferdinand
wasn't particularly well-liked

266
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:04,899
by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --
now that is a mustache!

267
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:08,698
But even so, the assassination led Austria
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

268
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,934
whereupon Serbia accepted some,
but not all, of Austria's demands,

269
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,518
leading Austria to declare
war against Serbia.

270
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,923
And then Russia, due to its alliance
with the Serbs, mobilized its army.

271
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,257
Germany, because it had
an alliance with Austria,

272
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,778
told Russia to stop mobilizing,

273
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,061
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army,

274
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:28,154
declared war on Russia,
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,

275
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:31,757
and then declared war on France,
because, you know, France.

276
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,234
(Laughter)

277
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,502
And it's not just physics
and world history

278
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,658
that people are choosing
to learn through YouTube.

279
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:43,060
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.

280
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,418
(Video) So you're me, and you're
in math class yet again,

281
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:50,444
because they make you go every single day.

282
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,735
And you're learning about, I don't know,
the sums of infinite series.

283
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,385
That's a high school topic, right?

284
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:59,325
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

285
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:02,507
So I guess that's why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.

286
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:05,683
So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you're doodling

287
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,639
and thinking more about what
the plural of "series" should be

288
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:12,305
than about the topic at hand: "serieses,"
"seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"

289
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,628
Or is it that the singular should be
changed: one "serie," or "serum,"

290
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,096
just like the singular of "sheep"
should be "shoop."

291
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,613
But the whole concept of things

292
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:23,098
like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
approaches one, is useful if, say,

293
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:24,885
you want to draw a line of elephants,

294
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,725
each holding the tail of the next one:

295
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,917
normal elephant, young elephant,
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,

296
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,912
puppy-sized elephant, all the way
down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.

297
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,717
Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,

298
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,688
because you can get an infinite number
of elephants in a line,

299
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:40,165
and still have it fit across
a single notebook page.

300
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,811
JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
from "Smarter Every Day,"

301
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,244
talking about the conservation
of angular momentum,

302
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,745
and, since it's YouTube, cats:

303
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,880
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

304
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:53,246
So you've probably observed that cats
almost always land on their feet.

305
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,230
Today's question is: why?

306
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,010
Like most simple questions,
there's a very complex answer.

307
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:00,044
For instance, let me reword this question:

308
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:05,263
How does a cat go from feet-up
to feet-down in a falling reference frame,

309
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:08,252
without violating the conservation
of angular momentum?

310
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,287
(Laughter)

311
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,788
JG: So, here's something all four
of these videos have in common:

312
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,336
They all have more than half
a million views on YouTube.

313
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,429
And those are people watching
not in classrooms,

314
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:23,094
but because they are part
of the communities of learning

315
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,133
that are being set up by these channels.

316
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:28,237
And I said earlier that YouTube
is like a classroom to me,

317
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,944
and in many ways it is,
because here is the instructor --

318
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:33,986
it's like the old-fashioned classroom:
here's the instructor,

319
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,333
and then beneath the instructor
are the students,

320
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:38,428
and they're all having a conversation.

321
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:42,481
And I know that YouTube comments
have a very bad reputation

322
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:43,900
in the world of the Internet,

323
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:46,995
but in fact, if you go on comments
for these channels,

324
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,174
what you'll find is people engaging
the subject matter,

325
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,445
asking difficult, complicated questions
that are about the subject matter,

326
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,207
and then other people
answering those questions.

327
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:02,065
And because the YouTube page is set up so
that the page in which I'm talking to you

328
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,932
is on the exact -- the place where I'm
talking to you is on the exact same page

329
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:07,114
as your comments,

330
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:12,770
you are participating in a live and real
and active way in the conversation.

331
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:16,365
And because I'm in comments usually,
I get to participate with you.

332
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,843
And you find this
whether it's world history,

333
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,929
or mathematics, or science,
or whatever it is.

334
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:27,571
You also see young people using the tools
and the sort of genres of the Internet

335
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,672
in order to create places
for intellectual engagement,

336
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,296
instead of the ironic detachment

337
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,017
that maybe most of us associate with memes
and other Internet conventions --

338
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,565
you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."

339
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,040
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo
criticizing industrial capitalism:

340
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:45,730
["Liberal capitalism is not at all
the Good of humanity.

341
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,313
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle
of savage, destructive nihilism."]

342
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,621
In case you can't see
what she says ... yeah.

343
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,802
I really believe that these spaces,

344
00:16:55,826 --> 00:17:00,859
these communities, have become
for a new generation of learners,

345
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:05,248
the kind of communities,
the kind of cartographic communities

346
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:09,815
that I had when I was in high school,
and then again when I was in college.

347
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,108
And as an adult, re-finding
these communities

348
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,442
has re-introduced me
to a community of learners,

349
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:21,364
and has encouraged me to continue
to be a learner even in my adulthood,

350
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:26,099
so that I no longer feel like learning
is something reserved for the young.

351
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,346
Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me

352
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,170
to all kinds of things
that I didn't know before.

353
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:33,253
And I know that we all hearken back

354
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:36,363
to the days of the Parisian salon
in the Enlightenment,

355
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:38,416
or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,

356
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,565
"Oh, I wish I could have been
a part of that,

357
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,434
I wish I could have laughed
at Dorothy Parker's jokes."

358
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,236
But I'm here to tell you that these places
exist, they still exist.

359
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,789
They exist in corners of the Internet,
where old men fear to tread.

360
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:53,816
(Laughter)

361
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,665
And I truly, truly believe that when
we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,

362
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:04,487
when we made Agloe real,
we were just getting started.

363
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,218
Thank you.

364
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,823
(Applause)
