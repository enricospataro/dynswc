1
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:14,901
So my name is Amy Webb,

2
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,598
and a few years ago
I found myself at the end

3
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:20,234
of yet another fantastic relationship

4
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:23,346
that came burning down
in a spectacular fashion.

5
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:26,598
And I thought, what's wrong with me?

6
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,680
I don't understand
why this keeps happening.

7
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,750
So I asked everybody in my life
what they thought.

8
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:36,179
I turned to my grandmother,
who always had plenty of advice,

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,171
and she said, "Stop being so picky.

10
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,549
You've got to date around.

11
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,927
And most importantly,

12
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:45,550
true love will find you
when you least expect it."

13
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,851
Now as it turns out,

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,408
I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,707
as you'll soon find.

16
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,897
I am constantly swimming
in numbers, formulas and charts.

17
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,297
I also have a very tight-knit family,

18
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,308
and I'm very, very close with my sister,

19
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:04,784
and as a result, I wanted to have
the same type of family when I grew up.

20
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,681
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,

21
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:07,908
I'm 30 years old,

22
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:11,635
I figure I'm probably going to have
to date somebody for about six months

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,477
before I'm ready to get monogamous

24
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,280
and before we can sort of cohabitate,

25
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:18,229
and we have to do that
for a while before we can get engaged.

26
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,222
And if I want to start having children
by the time I'm 35,

27
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:24,423
that meant that I would have
had to have been on my way to marriage

28
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:25,609
five years ago.

29
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:27,403
So that wasn't going to work.

30
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:31,150
If my strategy was to least-expect
my way into true love,

31
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,069
then the variable that I had
to deal with was serendipity.

32
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,837
In short, I was trying to figure out

33
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:39,749
what's the probability
of my finding Mr. Right?

34
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,002
Well, at the time I was living
in the city of Philadelphia,

35
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,121
and it's a big city, and I figured,

36
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:48,112
in this entire place,
there are lots of possibilities.

37
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,456
So again, I started doing some math.

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,190
Population of Philadelphia:
it has 1.5 million people.

39
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,929
I figure about half of that are men,

40
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,523
so that takes the number down to 750,000.

41
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:01,732
I'm looking for a guy
between the ages of 30 and 36,

42
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,287
which was only four percent
of the population,

43
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:06,888
so now I'm dealing
with the possibility of 30,000 men.

44
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,913
I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,

45
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:11,161
because I am and that was important to me.

46
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:13,700
That's only 2.3 percent of the population.

47
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:17,849
I figure I'm attracted to maybe
one out of 10 of those men,

48
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:22,686
and there was no way I was going to deal
with somebody who was an avid golfer.

49
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,746
So that basically meant
there were 35 men for me

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,974
that I could possibly date

51
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,666
in the entire city of Philadelphia.

52
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:35,357
In the meantime,
my very large Jewish family

53
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,159
was already all married
and well on their way

54
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,070
to having lots and lots of children,

55
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,571
and I felt like I was
under tremendous peer pressure

56
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,047
to get my life going already.

57
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:46,766
So I have two possible
strategies at this point

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,024
I'm sort of figuring out.

59
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:50,324
One, I can take my grandmother's advice

60
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,580
and sort of least-expect my way

61
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:56,795
into maybe bumping into the one
out of 35 possible men

62
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,992
in the entire 1.5-million-person
city of Philadelphia,

63
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:03,605
or I could try online dating.

64
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,162
Now, I like the idea of online dating,

65
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,163
because it's predicated on an algorithm,

66
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,312
and that's really just
a simple way of saying

67
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,628
I've got a problem,
I'm going to use some data,

68
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:15,033
run it through a system
and get to a solution.

69
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,405
So online dating is the second
most popular way

70
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,063
that people now meet each other,

71
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,373
but as it turns out,
algorithms have been around

72
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:25,658
for thousands of years
in almost every culture.

73
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:29,155
In fact, in Judaism,
there were matchmakers a long time ago,

74
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,866
and though they didn't have
an explicit algorithm per Se,

75
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,905
they definitely were running
through formulas in their heads,

76
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,872
like, is the girl going to like the boy?

77
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,612
Are the families going to get along?

78
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,065
What's the rabbi going to say?

79
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,476
Are they going to start
having children right away?

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,126
The matchmaker would sort
of think through all of this,

81
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,848
put two people together,
and that would be the end of it.

82
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,614
So in my case, I thought,

83
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:53,951
well, will data and an algorithm
lead me to my Prince Charming?

84
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,815
So I decided to sign on.

85
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,665
Now, there was one small catch.

86
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,296
As I'm signing on to the various
dating websites,

87
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,591
as it happens, I was really, really busy.

88
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,329
But that actually
wasn't the biggest problem.

89
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:09,373
The biggest problem is that I hate
filling out questionnaires of any kind,

90
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:13,776
and I certainly don't like questionnaires
that are like Cosmo quizzes.

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,274
So I just copied
and pasted from my résumé.

92
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,731
(Laughter)

93
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,379
So in the descriptive part up top,

94
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:26,705
I said that I was
an award-winning journalist

95
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,335
and a future thinker.

96
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,697
When I was asked about fun activities
and my ideal date,

97
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,907
I said monetization
and fluency in Japanese.

98
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,624
I talked a lot about JavaScript.

99
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,871
(Laughter)

100
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:45,022
So obviously this was not the best way
to put my most sexy foot forward.

101
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:50,047
But the real failure was that
there were plenty of men for me to date.

102
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,508
These algorithms had a sea full of men

103
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:55,214
that wanted to take me out
on lots of dates --

104
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:58,166
what turned out to be truly awful dates.

105
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,301
There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.

106
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,948
The algorithm matched us up
because we share a love of gadgets,

107
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:09,017
we share a love of math
and data and '80s music,

108
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,990
and so I agreed to go out with him.

109
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:13,647
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out

110
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,741
to one of Philadelphia's
white-table-cloth,

111
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,448
extremely expensive restaurants.

112
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,511
And we went in, and right off the bat,

113
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,771
our conversation really
wasn't taking flight,

114
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,600
but he was ordering a lot of food.

115
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,053
In fact, he didn't even bother
looking at the menu.

116
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,952
He was ordering multiple appetizers,
multiple entrées, for me as well,

117
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,834
and suddenly there are piles
and piles of food on our table,

118
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,912
also lots and lots of bottles of wine.

119
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,093
So we're nearing the end
of our conversation

120
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:40,014
and the end of dinner, and I've decided

121
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,148
Steve the I.T. guy and I are really
just not meant for each other,

122
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,735
but we'll part ways as friends,

123
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,184
when he gets up to go to the bathroom,

124
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,335
and in the meantime,
the bill comes to our table.

125
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,384
And listen, I'm a modern woman.

126
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:55,749
I am totally down with splitting the bill.

127
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,901
But then Steve the I.T. guy
didn't come back.

128
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,011
(Gasping)

129
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,416
And that was my entire month's rent.

130
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,774
(Audience gasps)

131
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,047
So needless to say,
I was not having a good night.

132
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,748
So I run home, I call
my mother, I call my sister,

133
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,946
and as I do, at the end of each one
of these terrible, terrible dates,

134
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,642
I regale them with the details.

135
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,198
And they say to me,

136
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:21,817
"Stop complaining."

137
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,776
(Laughter)

138
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,593
"You're just being too picky."

139
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:29,306
So I said, fine, from here on out
I'm only going on dates

140
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,033
where I know there's Wi-Fi,
and I'm bringing my laptop.

141
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,692
I'm going to shove it into my bag,

142
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:35,549
I'm going to have this email template,

143
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,002
and I'm going to fill it out
and collect information

144
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,442
on all these different
data points during the date

145
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,324
to prove to everybody that empirically,

146
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,925
these dates really are terrible.

147
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:44,972
(Laughter)

148
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:49,090
So I started tracking things like
really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;

149
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,269
bad vocabulary;

150
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,324
the number of times a man
forced me to high-five him.

151
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,498
(Laughter)

152
00:06:56,522 --> 00:07:00,888
So I started to crunch some numbers,

153
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,563
and that allowed me
to make some correlations.

154
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,187
So as it turns out,

155
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:11,285
for some reason, men who drink Scotch
reference kinky sex immediately.

156
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:13,422
(Laughter)

157
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:17,686
Well, it turns out
that these probably weren't bad guys.

158
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,596
There were just bad for me.

159
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,271
And as it happens, the algorithms
that were setting us up,

160
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,676
they weren't bad either.

161
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,969
These algorithms were doing exactly
what they were designed to do,

162
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,584
which was to take
our user-generated information,

163
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,088
in my case, my résumé,

164
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:35,115
and match it up
with other people's information.

165
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,806
See, the real problem here is that,

166
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,774
while the algorithms work just fine,

167
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,029
you and I don't,

168
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:42,166
when confronted with blank windows

169
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,691
where we're supposed to input
our information online.

170
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,366
Very few of us have the ability

171
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,842
to be totally and brutally
honest with ourselves.

172
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:52,438
The other problem
is that these websites are asking us

173
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,316
questions like, are you
a dog person or a cat person?

174
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,301
Do you like horror films or romance films?

175
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,055
I'm not looking for a pen pal.

176
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,965
I'm looking for a husband. Right?

177
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:05,380
So there's a certain amount
of superficiality in that data.

178
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,950
So I said fine, I've got a new plan.

179
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:10,355
I'm going to keep using
these online dating sites,

180
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,840
but I'm going to treat them as databases,

181
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,529
and rather than waiting
for an algorithm to set me up,

182
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:18,807
I think I'm going to try
reverse-engineering this entire system.

183
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,221
So knowing that there was superficial data

184
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,769
that was being used
to match me up with other people,

185
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:27,220
I decided instead to ask my own questions.

186
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,974
What was every single possible thing

187
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,635
that I could think of
that I was looking for in a mate?

188
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,562
So I started writing

189
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,278
and writing and writing,

190
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:41,097
and at the end, I had amassed
72 different data points.

191
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,375
I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,

192
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,972
so I was looking for somebody

193
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,726
who had the same background
and thoughts on our culture,

194
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,090
but wasn't going to force me to go to shul
every Friday and Saturday.

195
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,183
I wanted somebody who worked hard,

196
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:55,255
because work for me
is extremely important,

197
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,831
but not too hard.

198
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,363
For me, the hobbies that I have

199
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,228
are really just new work projects
that I've launched.

200
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:04,312
I also wanted somebody
who not only wanted two children,

201
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,498
but was going to have the same
attitude toward parenting that I do,

202
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:09,585
so somebody who was going
to be totally okay

203
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:12,963
with forcing our child to start
taking piano lessons at age three,

204
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:17,732
and also maybe computer science classes
if we could wrangle it.

205
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:20,439
So things like that,
but I also wanted somebody

206
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:23,380
who would go to far-flung,
exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.

207
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,506
I also wanted somebody who would weigh
20 pounds more than me at all times,

208
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,912
regardless of what I weighed.

209
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,023
(Laughter)

210
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,935
So I now have
these 72 different data points,

211
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,170
which, to be fair, is a lot.

212
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,321
So what I did was, I went through
and I prioritized that list.

213
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,138
I broke it into a top tier
and a second tier of points,

214
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,363
and I ranked everything starting at 100

215
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,613
and going all the way down to 91,

216
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:52,043
and listing things like I was looking
for somebody who was really smart,

217
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,830
who would challenge and stimulate me,

218
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,576
and balancing that with a second tier
and a second set of points.

219
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,831
These things were also important to me
but not necessarily deal-breakers.

220
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,402
(Laughter)

221
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:07,027
So once I had all this done,
I then built a scoring system,

222
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,532
because what I wanted to do
was to sort of mathematically calculate

223
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:14,038
whether or not I thought
the guy that I found online

224
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:15,453
would be a match with me.

225
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:17,984
I figured there would be
a minimum of 700 points

226
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,608
before I would agree to email somebody
or respond to an email message.

227
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,823
For 900 points,
I'd agree to go out on a date,

228
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,504
and I wouldn't even consider
any kind of relationship

229
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,567
before somebody had crossed
the 1,500 point threshold.

230
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:33,351
Well, as it turns out,
this worked pretty well.

231
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,289
So I go back online now.

232
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,915
I found Jewishdoc57

233
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:40,852
who's incredibly good-looking,
incredibly well-spoken,

234
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,570
he had hiked Mt. Fuji,

235
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:44,500
he had walked along the Great Wall.

236
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:45,675
He likes to travel

237
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,825
as long as it doesn't involve
a cruise ship.

238
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,362
And I thought,

239
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:50,537
I've done it!

240
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,096
I've cracked the code.

241
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,183
I have just found
the Jewish Prince Charming

242
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:57,779
of my family's dreams.

243
00:10:58,556 --> 00:10:59,925
There was only one problem:

244
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,806
He didn't like me back.

245
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:06,769
And I guess the one variable
that I haven't considered

246
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:08,203
is the competition.

247
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:11,563
Who are all of the other women
on these dating sites?

248
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:15,848
I found SmileyGirl1978.

249
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:19,128
She said she was a "Fun girl
who is Happy and Outgoing."

250
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:20,758
She listed her job as "teacher."

251
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:23,176
She said she is
"silly, nice and friendly."

252
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,234
She likes to make people laugh "alot."

253
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,196
At this moment I knew,

254
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,305
clicking profile after profile
that looked like this,

255
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,823
that I needed to do some market research.

256
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:35,574
So I created 10 fake male profiles.

257
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:38,518
Now, before I lose all of you --

258
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,750
(Laughter) --

259
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:45,996
understand that I did this
strictly to gather data

260
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,744
about everybody else in the system.

261
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:52,055
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style
relationships with anybody.

262
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,952
I really was just scraping their data.

263
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:55,920
But I didn't want everybody's data.

264
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:59,367
I only wanted data on the women
who were going to be attracted

265
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:02,089
to the type of man that I really,
really wanted to marry.

266
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:06,196
When I released these men into the wild,

267
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,498
I did follow some rules.

268
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,638
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.

269
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,615
I just waited to see
who these profiles were going to attract,

270
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,930
and mainly what I was looking at
was two different data sets.

271
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,716
So I was looking at qualitative data,

272
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,417
so what was the humor, the tone,

273
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,061
the voice, the communication style

274
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,829
that these women shared in common?

275
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,139
And also quantitative data,

276
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:26,450
so what was the average length
of their profile,

277
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,843
how much time was spent between messages?

278
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:32,291
What I was trying to get at here was
that I figured, in person,

279
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:35,766
I would be just as competitive
as a SmileyGirl1978.

280
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,187
I wanted to figure out how to maximize
my own profile online.

281
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,333
Well, one month later,

282
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:46,086
I had a lot of data,
and I was able to do another analysis.

283
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,966
And as it turns out,
content matters a lot.

284
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,941
So smart people tend to write a lot --

285
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:55,290
3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words
about themselves,

286
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,617
which may all be very, very interesting.

287
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:00,521
The challenge here, though,
is that the popular men and women

288
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:03,742
are sticking to 97 words on average

289
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,686
that are written very, very well,

290
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,354
even though it may not seem
like it all the time.

291
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,717
The other hallmark
of the people who do this well

292
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,844
is that they're using
non-specific language.

293
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:14,170
So in my case,

294
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,780
"The English Patient"
is my most favorite movie ever,

295
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:20,953
but it doesn't work
to use that in a profile,

296
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,931
because that's a superficial data point,

297
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,147
and somebody may disagree

298
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,914
and decide they don't want to go out

299
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,902
because they didn't like
sitting through the three-hour movie.

300
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,906
Also, optimistic language matters a lot.

301
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,142
So this is a word cloud

302
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,602
highlighting the most popular
words that were used

303
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,934
by the most popular women,

304
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,331
words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."

305
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:42,188
And what I realized was not
that I had to dumb down my own profile.

306
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,720
Remember, I'm somebody who said

307
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:46,763
that I speak fluent Japanese
and I know JavaScript

308
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:48,508
and I was okay with that.

309
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,290
The difference is that it's about being
more approachable

310
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:54,841
and helping people understand
the best way to reach out to you.

311
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,885
And as it turns out, timing
is also really, really important.

312
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,157
Just because you have access
to somebody's mobile phone number

313
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,913
or their instant message account

314
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,852
and it's 2 o'clock in the morning
and you happen to be awake,

315
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:09,191
doesn't mean that that's a good time
to communicate with those people.

316
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,158
The popular women on these online sites

317
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,649
spend an average of 23 hours
in between each communication.

318
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:19,367
And that's what we would normally do
in the usual process of courtship.

319
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,577
And finally --

320
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,967
there were the photos.

321
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:26,016
All of the women who were popular
showed some skin.

322
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,242
They all looked really great,

323
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:31,144
which turned out to be in sharp contrast

324
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,668
to what I had uploaded.

325
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:34,430
(Laughter)

326
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,160
Once I had all of this information,

327
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:38,297
I was able to create a super profile,

328
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,322
so it was still me,

329
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,314
but it was me optimized now
for this ecosystem.

330
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,211
And as it turns out,
I did a really good job.

331
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,986
I was the most popular person online.

332
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,505
(Laughter)

333
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,719
(Applause)

334
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:02,206
And as it turns out, lots and lots
of men wanted to date me.

335
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,031
So I call my mom, I call my sister,
I call my grandmother.

336
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:07,184
I'm telling them about this fabulous news,

337
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,437
and they say, "This is wonderful!
How soon are you going out?"

338
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:13,143
I said, "Actually, I'm not going
to go out with anybody."

339
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,041
Because remember, in my scoring system,

340
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:17,561
they have to reach a minimum
threshold of 700 points,

341
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,124
and none of them have done that.

342
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,227
They said, "What?
You're still being too damn picky."

343
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:25,785
Well, not too long after that,
I found this guy, Thevenin,

344
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,800
and he said that he was culturally Jewish,

345
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:32,340
he said that his job
was an arctic baby seal hunter,

346
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,140
which I thought was very clever.

347
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:37,017
He talked in detail about travel.

348
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,708
He made a lot of really
interesting cultural references.

349
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,474
He looked and talked exactly
like what I wanted,

350
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:45,632
and immediately, he scored 850 points.

351
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,320
It was enough for a date.

352
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,436
Three weeks later, we met up in person

353
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,940
for what turned out to be
a 14-hour-long conversation

354
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:55,011
that went from coffee shop to restaurant

355
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,192
to another coffee shop
to another restaurant,

356
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:59,740
and when he dropped me back off
at my house that night

357
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:00,915
I re-scored him --

358
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,105
[1,050 points!]

359
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,402
Thought, you know what,

360
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,986
this entire time,
I haven't been picky enough.

361
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,375
Well, a year and a half after that,

362
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,922
we were non-cruise ship traveling

363
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,007
through Petra, Jordan,

364
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,516
when he got down on his knee and proposed.

365
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,979
A year after that, we were married,

366
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,882
and about a year and a half after that,

367
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:23,126
our daughter, Petra, was born.

368
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,562
Audience: Oh!

369
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,460
(Applause)

370
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:28,816
[What it means...]

371
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,886
Obviously, I'm having
a fabulous life, so --

372
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,446
(Laughter)

373
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,942
The question is, what does
all of this mean for you?

374
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:40,790
Well, as it turns out,
there is an algorithm for love.

375
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:44,115
It's just not the ones
that we're being presented with online.

376
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,796
In fact, it's something
that you write yourself.

377
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,154
So whether you're looking
for a husband or a wife

378
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,035
or you're trying to find your passion

379
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,821
or you're trying to start a business,

380
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,699
all you have to really do
is figure out your own framework

381
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,483
and play by your own rules,

382
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,768
and feel free to be as picky as you want.

383
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,583
Well, on my wedding day,

384
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,846
I had a conversation again
with my grandmother,

385
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,286
and she said, "All right,
maybe I was wrong.

386
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,725
It looks like you did come up
with a really, really great system.

387
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:11,479
Now, your matzah balls ...

388
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:14,773
They should be fluffy, not hard."

389
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:15,955
(Laughter)

390
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,563
And I'll take her advice on that.

391
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:21,391
(Applause)
