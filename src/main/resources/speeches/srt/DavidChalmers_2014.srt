1
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,335
Right now

2
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,809
you have a movie playing inside your head.

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,336
It's an amazing multi-track movie.

4
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:23,660
It has 3D vision and surround sound

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,296
for what you're seeing and hearing right now,

6
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,615
but that's just the start of it.

7
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:33,798
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.

8
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:36,350
It has a sense of your body,

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,669
pain, hunger, orgasms.

10
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,710
It has emotions,

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,246
anger and happiness.

12
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,040
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,740
playing before you.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,195
And it has this constant voiceover narrative

15
00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:01,571
in your stream of conscious thinking.

16
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:06,644
At the heart of this movie is you

17
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:11,009
experiencing all this directly.

18
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,701
This movie is your stream of consciousness,

19
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,008
the subject of experience

20
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:23,146
of the mind and the world.

21
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,451
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts

22
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,468
of human existence.

23
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:30,400
Each of us is conscious.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,129
We all have our own inner movie,

25
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,860
you and you and you.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,580
There's nothing we know about more directly.

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,052
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.

28
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:47,050
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.

29
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,478
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.

30
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,178
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives

31
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:57,543
would have meaning or value.

32
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:58,709
But at the same time, it's the most

33
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,879
mysterious phenomenon in the universe.

34
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,252
Why are we conscious?

35
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,793
Why do we have these inner movies?

36
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,046
Why aren't we just robots

37
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,289
who process all this input,

38
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,306
produce all that output,

39
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:18,161
without experiencing the inner movie at all?

40
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,670
Right now, nobody knows the answers

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,416
to those questions.

42
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,125
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness

43
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,820
into science, some radical ideas may be needed.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,786
Some people say a science of consciousness

45
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,738
is impossible.

46
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,506
Science, by its nature, is objective.

47
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:42,931
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.

48
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:47,380
So there can never be a science of consciousness.

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,600
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,418
Psychologists studied behavior objectively,

51
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:58,480
neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,030
and nobody even mentioned consciousness.

53
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,786
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,

54
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,168
there was very little scientific work

55
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,720
on consciousness.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,425
Now, about 20 years ago,

57
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,398
all that began to change.

58
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:17,175
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick

59
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,931
and physicists like Roger Penrose

60
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,171
said now is the time for science

61
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,947
to attack consciousness.

62
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,267
And since then, there's been a real explosion,

63
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,604
a flowering of scientific work

64
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,868
on consciousness.

65
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,907
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.

66
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,995
But it also has some fundamental

67
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:38,820
limitations so far.

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,478
The centerpiece

69
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:43,298
of the science of consciousness in recent years

70
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,793
has been the search for correlations,

71
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,922
correlations between certain areas of the brain

72
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:52,940
and certain states of consciousness.

73
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,030
We saw some of this kind of work

74
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,790
from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work

75
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,066
she presented just a few minutes ago.

76
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,629
Now we understand much better, for example,

77
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,946
the kinds of brain areas that go along with

78
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,317
the conscious experience of seeing faces

79
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,437
or of feeling pain

80
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:13,926
or of feeling happy.

81
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:16,742
But this is still a science of correlations.

82
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:20,098
It's not a science of explanations.

83
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,721
We know that these brain areas

84
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,645
go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,

85
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:30,281
but we don't know why they do.

86
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,606
I like to put this by saying

87
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,003
that this kind of work from neuroscience

88
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:37,749
is answering some of the questions

89
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,554
we want answered about consciousness,

90
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:43,327
the questions about what certain brain areas do

91
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,436
and what they correlate with.

92
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:48,592
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.

93
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,033
No knock on the neuroscientists.

94
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,654
There are no truly easy
problems with consciousness.

95
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:58,245
But it doesn't address the real mystery

96
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,175
at the core of this subject:

97
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,395
why is it that all that physical processing in a brain

98
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:07,320
should be accompanied by consciousness at all?

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,526
Why is there this inner subjective movie?

100
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,780
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.

101
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,813
And you might say,

102
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:19,368
let's just give neuroscience a few years.

103
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:23,148
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon

104
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:28,030
like traffic jams, like hurricanes,

105
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,651
like life, and we'll figure it out.

106
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,722
The classical cases of emergence

107
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:36,100
are all cases of emergent behavior,

108
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,447
how a traffic jam behaves,

109
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,943
how a hurricane functions,

110
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:42,136
how a living organism reproduces

111
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:45,725
and adapts and metabolizes,

112
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,008
all questions about objective functioning.

113
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:50,830
You could apply that to the human brain

114
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,339
in explaining some of the behaviors

115
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,612
and the functions of the human brain

116
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:55,771
as emergent phenomena:

117
00:05:55,771 --> 00:06:00,169
how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,

118
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,059
all these questions about behavior.

119
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,186
But when it comes to consciousness,

120
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,075
questions about behavior

121
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:09,000
are among the easy problems.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,597
When it comes to the hard problem,

123
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,974
that's the question of why is it

124
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,785
that all this behavior

125
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:17,630
is accompanied by subjective experience?

126
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,385
And here, the standard paradigm

127
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,231
of emergence,

128
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,178
even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,

129
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:28,621
don't really, so far, have that much to say.

130
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,266
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.

131
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:36,293
I want a scientific theory of consciousness

132
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,622
that works,

133
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:41,029
and for a long time, I banged my head

134
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,470
against the wall

135
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,607
looking for a theory of consciousness

136
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,363
in purely physical terms

137
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,690
that would work.

138
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,433
But I eventually came to the conclusion

139
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:53,618
that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.

140
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,553
It's a long story,

141
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:58,270
but the core idea is just that what you get

142
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,610
from purely reductionist explanations

143
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,254
in physical terms, in brain-based terms,

144
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,369
is stories about the functioning of a system,

145
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,495
its structure, its dynamics,

146
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,487
the behavior it produces,

147
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,567
great for solving the easy problems —

148
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,065
how we behave, how we function —

149
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:17,518
but when it comes to subjective experience —

150
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:21,079
why does all this feel like
something from the inside? —

151
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,154
that's something fundamentally new,

152
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:27,047
and it's always a further question.

153
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:32,460
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.

154
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,675
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,

155
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:39,275
we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,

156
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,515
chemistry explains biology,

157
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:46,362
biology explains parts of psychology.

158
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:47,820
But consciousness

159
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,591
doesn't seem to fit into this picture.

160
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,481
On the one hand, it's a datum

161
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,450
that we're conscious.

162
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,736
On the other hand, we don't know how

163
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,714
to accommodate it into our
scientific view of the world.

164
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,661
So I think consciousness right now

165
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,124
is a kind of anomaly,

166
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,160
one that we need to integrate

167
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,060
into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.

168
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,988
Faced with an anomaly like this,

169
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:15,227
radical ideas may be needed,

170
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,232
and I think that we may need one or two ideas

171
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,672
that initially seem crazy

172
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,608
before we can come to grips with consciousness

173
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,700
scientifically.

174
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,299
Now, there are a few candidates

175
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,795
for what those crazy ideas might be.

176
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:34,137
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.

177
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,534
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem

178
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,277
of consciousness.

179
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:41,640
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie

180
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,252
involves a kind of illusion or confusion.

181
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,150
Actually, all we've got to do is explain

182
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,157
the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,

183
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,182
and then we've explained everything

184
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,657
that needs to be explained.

185
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:58,266
Well I say, more power to him.

186
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,280
That's the kind of radical idea

187
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,204
that we need to explore

188
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:04,543
if you want to have a purely reductionist

189
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:08,093
brain-based theory of consciousness.

190
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,164
At the same time, for me and for many other people,

191
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,991
that view is a bit too close to simply

192
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:14,012
denying the datum of consciousness

193
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,515
to be satisfactory.

194
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,583
So I go in a different direction.

195
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,769
In the time remaining,

196
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,768
I want to explore two crazy ideas

197
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:26,485
that I think may have some promise.

198
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:28,105
The first crazy idea

199
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:32,730
is that consciousness is fundamental.

200
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,571
Physicists sometimes take
some aspects of the universe

201
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:37,731
as fundamental building blocks:

202
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:41,480
space and time and mass.

203
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,090
They postulate fundamental laws governing them,

204
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,980
like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.

205
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,290
These fundamental properties and laws

206
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,507
aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.

207
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,247
Rather, they're taken as primitive,

208
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,626
and you build up the world from there.

209
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:05,725
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.

210
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,182
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out

211
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:11,350
that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena

212
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,701
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

213
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,770
space, time, mass, Newton's laws —

214
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,341
so he postulated fundamental laws

215
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,155
of electromagnetism

216
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,566
and postulated electric charge

217
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,334
as a fundamental element

218
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,293
that those laws govern.

219
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,576
I think that's the situation we're in

220
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,186
with consciousness.

221
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,671
If you can't explain consciousness

222
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,089
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

223
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:40,760
space, time, mass, charge —

224
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,190
then as a matter of logic,
you need to expand the list.

225
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,666
The natural thing to do is to postulate

226
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,922
consciousness itself as something fundamental,

227
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,954
a fundamental building block of nature.

228
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:55,922
This doesn't mean you suddenly
can't do science with it.

229
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,520
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.

230
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,424
What we then need is to study

231
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,377
the fundamental laws governing consciousness,

232
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,757
the laws that connect consciousness

233
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,558
to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,

234
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,494
physical processes.

235
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:14,676
Physicists sometimes say

236
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,556
that we want fundamental laws so simple

237
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:21,358
that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

238
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,079
Well I think something like that is the situation

239
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,947
we're in with consciousness.

240
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,697
We want to find fundamental laws so simple

241
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,784
we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

242
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,359
We don't know what those laws are yet,

243
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:35,386
but that's what we're after.

244
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,803
The second crazy idea

245
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:41,281
is that consciousness might be universal.

246
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,342
Every system might have some degree

247
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:48,067
of consciousness.

248
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:51,028
This view is sometimes called panpsychism:

249
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,030
pan for all, psych for mind,

250
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,801
every system is conscious,

251
00:11:55,801 --> 00:12:00,048
not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,

252
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,625
but even Rob Knight's microbes,

253
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,812
elementary particles.

254
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:07,525
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.

255
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:11,304
The idea is not that photons are intelligent

256
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,381
or thinking.

257
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,811
It's not that a photon

258
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,256
is wracked with angst

259
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:18,548
because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always
buzzing around near the speed of light.

260
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:21,540
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,684
No, not like that.

262
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:26,732
But the thought is maybe photons might have

263
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,355
some element of raw, subjective feeling,

264
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:33,507
some primitive precursor to consciousness.

265
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,361
This may sound a bit kooky to you.

266
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:39,144
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?

267
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,704
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,

268
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,850
that consciousness is fundamental.

269
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,225
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,

270
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,890
it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,

271
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,790
the way they are.

272
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,739
It's also worth noting that although the idea

273
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,763
seems counterintuitive to us,

274
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,507
it's much less counterintuitive to people

275
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:02,238
from different cultures,

276
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,758
where the human mind is seen as much more

277
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,830
continuous with nature.

278
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,564
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that

279
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,573
perhaps the most simple and powerful way

280
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,807
to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness

281
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,787
to physical processing

282
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,882
is to link consciousness to information.

283
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,893
Wherever there's information processing,

284
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:22,958
there's consciousness.

285
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,498
Complex information processing, like in a human,

286
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,040
complex consciousness.

287
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,169
Simple information processing,

288
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:31,127
simple consciousness.

289
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,458
A really exciting thing is in recent years

290
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,723
a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,

291
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:37,966
has taken this kind of theory

292
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,041
and developed it rigorously

293
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,890
with a mathematical theory.

294
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,407
He has a mathematical measure

295
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,137
of information integration

296
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:47,056
which he calls phi,

297
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,663
measuring the amount of information

298
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,283
integrated in a system.

299
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,652
And he supposes that phi goes along

300
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:54,090
with consciousness.

301
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,411
So in a human brain,

302
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,930
incredibly large amount of information integration,

303
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,964
high degree of phi,

304
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,513
a whole lot of consciousness.

305
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:05,206
In a mouse, medium degree
of information integration,

306
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,225
still pretty significant,

307
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,250
pretty serious amount of consciousness.

308
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,515
But as you go down to worms,

309
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,992
microbes, particles,

310
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:15,526
the amount of phi falls off.

311
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,959
The amount of information integration falls off,

312
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,407
but it's still non-zero.

313
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,346
On Tononi's theory,

314
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:23,553
there's still going to be a non-zero degree

315
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,382
of consciousness.

316
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,921
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law

317
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:31,305
of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.

318
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,927
Now, I don't know if this theory is right,

319
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:37,138
but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now

320
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:38,524
in the science of consciousness,

321
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:40,755
and it's been used to integrate a whole range

322
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,142
of scientific data,

323
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:45,385
and it does have a nice property
that it is in fact simple enough

324
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,880
you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.

325
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,505
Another final motivation is that

326
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:53,556
panpsychism might help us to integrate

327
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,770
consciousness into the physical world.

328
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,947
Physicists and philosophers have often observed

329
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,388
that physics is curiously abstract.

330
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,536
It describes the structure of reality

331
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,620
using a bunch of equations,

332
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,644
but it doesn't tell us about the reality

333
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,212
that underlies it.

334
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,109
As Stephen Hawking puts it,

335
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:17,163
what puts the fire into the equations?

336
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,781
Well, on the panpsychist view,

337
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,420
you can leave the equations of physics as they are,

338
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,984
but you can take them to be describing

339
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:25,658
the flux of consciousness.

340
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,696
That's what physics really is ultimately doing,

341
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:30,025
describing the flux of consciousness.

342
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,678
On this view, it's consciousness

343
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:35,924
that puts the fire into the equations.

344
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,584
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle

345
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,260
outside the physical world

346
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,678
as some kind of extra.

347
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:44,134
It's there right at its heart.

348
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:47,008
This view, I think, the panpsychist view,

349
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:50,309
has the potential to transfigure our relationship

350
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:51,804
to nature,

351
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:54,039
and it may have some pretty serious social

352
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,732
and ethical consequences.

353
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,891
Some of these may be counterintuitive.

354
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,962
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything

355
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,424
which is conscious,

356
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,028
so therefore I should be vegetarian.

357
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,595
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,

358
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,325
you're going to go very hungry.

359
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,613
So I think when you think about it,

360
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,780
this tends to transfigure your views,

361
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,023
whereas what matters for ethical purposes

362
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,297
and moral considerations,

363
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:23,374
not so much the fact of consciousness,

364
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:27,330
but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.

365
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,268
It's also natural to ask about consciousness

366
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:32,318
in other systems, like computers.

367
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,107
What about the artificially intelligent system

368
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:37,549
in the movie "Her," Samantha?

369
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,949
Is she conscious?

370
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,380
Well, if you take the informational,

371
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,560
panpsychist view,

372
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,031
she certainly has complicated information processing

373
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,452
and integration,

374
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:49,119
so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.

375
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:52,057
If that's right, it raises pretty serious

376
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,422
ethical issues about both the ethics

377
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:57,943
of developing intelligent computer systems

378
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:00,679
and the ethics of turning them off.

379
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,179
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness

380
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,061
of whole groups,

381
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,898
the planet.

382
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:09,821
Does Canada have its own consciousness?

383
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,920
Or at a more local level,

384
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,128
does an integrated group

385
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:15,391
like the audience at a TED conference,

386
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,840
are we right now having a
collective TED consciousness,

387
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,333
an inner movie

388
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,139
for this collective TED group

389
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,819
which is distinct from the inner movies

390
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,908
of each of our parts?

391
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:28,063
I don't know the answer to that question,

392
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,444
but I think it's at least one

393
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,918
worth taking seriously.

394
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,255
Okay, so this panpsychist vision,

395
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,068
it is a radical one,

396
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:38,282
and I don't know that it's correct.

397
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,135
I'm actually more confident about

398
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:41,768
the first crazy idea,

399
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,937
that consciousness is fundamental,

400
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,740
than about the second one,

401
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,961
that it's universal.

402
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,039
I mean, the view raises any number of questions,

403
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,580
has any number of challenges,

404
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,940
like how do those little bits

405
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,680
of consciousness add up

406
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,977
to the kind of complex consciousness

407
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,300
we know and love.

408
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,760
If we can answer those questions,

409
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,265
then I think we're going to be well on our way

410
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:05,352
to a serious theory of consciousness.

411
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,740
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps

412
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,584
in science and philosophy.

413
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:14,029
We can't expect to solve it overnight.

414
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,569
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.

415
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,556
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,

416
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:23,008
both to understanding the universe

417
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:25,538
and to understanding ourselves.

418
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,441
It may just take the right crazy idea.

419
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,432
Thank you.

420
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,120
