1
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:14,796
I think I was supposed
to talk about my new book,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,699
which is called "Blink,"

3
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:19,467
and it's about snap judgments
and first impressions.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,611
And it comes out in January,
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

5
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,109
(Laughter)

6
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,796
But I was thinking about this,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,030
and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy,

8
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,690
and I think would make my mother happy,

9
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,172
it's not really about happiness.

10
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:39,796
So I decided instead,
I would talk about someone

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,499
who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy

12
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:46,796
as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,796
a man who is a great
personal hero of mine:

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,796
someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,920
who is most famous
for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

16
00:00:57,143 --> 00:01:01,796
Howard's about this high, and he's round,

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,909
and he's in his 60s,
and he has big huge glasses

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,726
and thinning gray hair,

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,574
and he has a kind of wonderful
exuberance and vitality,

20
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,606
and he has a parrot,
and he loves the opera,

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,721
and he's a great aficionado
of medieval history.

22
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:22,627
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.

23
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:27,288
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea
what psychophysics is,

24
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:29,002
although at some point in my life,

25
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,472
I dated a girl for two years

26
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,736
who was getting
her doctorate in psychophysics.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,304
Which should tell you something
about that relationship.

28
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,625
(Laughter)

29
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,796
As far as I know, psychophysics
is about measuring things.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,451
And Howard is very interested
in measuring things.

31
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,848
And he graduated
with his doctorate from Harvard,

32
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:50,120
and he set up a little consulting shop
in White Plains, New York.

33
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,233
And one of his first clients was Pepsi.

34
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,335
This is many years ago,
back in the early 70s.

35
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,176
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,598
"You know, there's this new
thing called aspartame,

37
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,506
and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.

38
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,507
We'd like you to figure out

39
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:09,037
how much aspartame we should put
in each can of Diet Pepsi

40
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,818
in order to have the perfect drink."

41
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,796
Now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer,

42
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,297
and that's what Howard thought.

43
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,622
Because Pepsi told him,

44
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:21,329
"We're working with a band
between eight and 12 percent.

45
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:24,272
Anything below eight percent
sweetness is not sweet enough;

46
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:27,535
anything above 12 percent
sweetness is too sweet.

47
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,642
We want to know: what's the sweet
spot between 8 and 12?"

48
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:35,153
Now, if I gave you this problem to do,
you would all say, it's very simple.

49
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:38,796
What we do is you make up
a big experimental batch of Pepsi,

50
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,306
at every degree of sweetness --
eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,611
all the way up to 12 --

52
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:47,124
and we try this out
with thousands of people,

53
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:49,354
and we plot the results on a curve,

54
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,359
and we take the most popular
concentration, right?

55
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,638
Really simple.

56
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:56,202
Howard does the experiment,
and he gets the data back,

57
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,567
and he plots it on a curve,

58
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,455
and all of a sudden he realizes
it's not a nice bell curve.

59
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,433
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.

60
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,239
It's a mess. It's all over the place.

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,433
Now, most people in that business,
in the world of testing food and such,

62
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,274
are not dismayed
when the data comes back a mess.

63
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:13,790
They think, "Well, you know,

64
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:16,648
figuring out what people think
about cola's not that easy."

65
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:19,497
"You know, maybe we made an error
somewhere along the way."

66
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:21,718
"You know, let's just
make an educated guess,"

67
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:24,127
and they simply point
and they go for 10 percent,

68
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,226
right in the middle.

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,796
Howard is not so easily placated.

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,732
Howard is a man of a certain degree
of intellectual standards.

71
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,796
And this was not good enough for him,

72
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,102
and this question bedeviled him for years.

73
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:37,796
And he would think it through
and say, "What was wrong?

74
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,505
Why could we not make sense
of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,796
And one day, he was sitting
in a diner in White Plains,

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,796
about to go trying to dream up
some work for Nescafé.

77
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:51,640
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,
the answer came to him.

78
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,647
And that is, that when they analyzed
the Diet Pepsi data,

79
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,393
they were asking the wrong question.

80
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,547
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,

81
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,534
and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsis.

82
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:03,645
Trust me.

83
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,796
This was an enormous revelation.

84
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,495
This was one of the most brilliant
breakthroughs in all of food science.

85
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,237
Howard immediately went on the road,

86
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,619
and he would go to conferences
around the country,

87
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,201
and he would stand up and say,

88
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,288
"You had been looking
for the perfect Pepsi.

89
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,542
You're wrong.

90
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:21,074
You should be looking
for the perfect Pepsis."

91
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,113
And people would look at him
blankly and say,

92
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,200
"What are you talking about? Craziness."

93
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,796
And they would say, "Move! Next!"

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,034
Tried to get business,
nobody would hire him --

95
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:31,442
he was obsessed, though,

96
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,473
and he talked about it
and talked about it.

97
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,290
Howard loves the Yiddish expression

98
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,796
"To a worm in horseradish,
the world is horseradish."

99
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,961
This was his horseradish.

100
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,647
(Laughter)

101
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,110
He was obsessed with it!

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,631
And finally, he had a breakthrough.

103
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,796
Vlasic Pickles came to him,

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,469
and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz,
we want to make the perfect pickle."

105
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,517
And he said,

106
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,470
"There is no perfect pickle;
there are only perfect pickles."

107
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,921
And he came back to them and he said,

108
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,155
"You don't just need
to improve your regular;

109
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,672
you need to create zesty."

110
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,521
And that's where we got zesty pickles.

111
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,796
Then the next person came to him:
Campbell's Soup.

112
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
And this was even more important.

113
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,890
In fact, Campbell's Soup
is where Howard made his reputation.

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,633
Campbell's made Prego,

115
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:19,525
and Prego, in the early 80s,
was struggling next to Ragù,

116
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:22,914
which was the dominant
spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.

117
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,209
In the industry -- I don't
know whether you care about this,

118
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,233
or how much time I have to go into this.

119
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:30,887
But it was, technically speaking
-- this is an aside --

120
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,971
Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.

121
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,276
The quality of the tomato paste
is much better;

122
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,120
the spice mix is far superior;

123
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,630
it adheres to the pasta
in a much more pleasing way.

124
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:41,731
In fact, they would do
the famous bowl test

125
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,400
back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.

126
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:47,916
You'd have a plate of spaghetti,
and you would pour it on, right?

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,925
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,
and the Prego would sit on top.

128
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,480
That's called "adherence."

129
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:59,044
And, anyway, despite the fact
that they were far superior in adherence,

130
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,839
and the quality of their tomato paste,

131
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,232
Prego was struggling.

132
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:06,258
So they came to Howard,
and they said, fix us.

133
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:09,130
And Howard looked
at their product line, and he said,

134
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:12,257
what you have is a dead tomato society.

135
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:15,185
So he said, this is what I want to do.

136
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,765
And he got together
with the Campbell's soup kitchen,

137
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,250
and he made 45 varieties
of spaghetti sauce.

138
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,127
And he varied them according
to every conceivable way

139
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,796
that you can vary tomato sauce:

140
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,678
by sweetness, by level of garlic,

141
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:30,917
by tomatoey-ness,
by tartness, by sourness,

142
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,281
by visible solids --

143
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:35,566
my favorite term
in the spaghetti sauce business.

144
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,591
(Laughter)

145
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:40,153
Every conceivable way
you can vary spaghetti sauce,

146
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,956
he varied spaghetti sauce.

147
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,713
And then he took this whole raft
of 45 spaghetti sauces,

148
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:46,894
and he went on the road.

149
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,797
He went to New York, to Chicago,

150
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:50,750
he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.

151
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:54,536
And he brought in people
by the truckload into big halls.

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,285
And he sat them down for two hours,

153
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:59,636
and over the course of that two hours,
he gave them ten bowls.

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,918
Ten small bowls of pasta,

155
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,400
with a different spaghetti
sauce on each one.

156
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:08,151
And after they ate each bowl,
they had to rate, from 0 to 100,

157
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,796
how good they thought
the spaghetti sauce was.

158
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,381
At the end of that process,
after doing it for months and months,

159
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,948
he had a mountain of data

160
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:19,796
about how the American people
feel about spaghetti sauce.

161
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,287
And then he analyzed the data.

162
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:25,288
Did he look for the most popular
variety of spaghetti sauce?

163
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,066
No! Howard doesn't believe
that there is such a thing.

164
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,153
Instead, he looked
at the data, and he said,

165
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:35,796
let's see if we can group all these
different data points into clusters.

166
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,272
Let's see if they congregate
around certain ideas.

167
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,025
And sure enough, if you sit down,

168
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:44,614
and you analyze all this data
on spaghetti sauce,

169
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,748
you realize that all Americans
fall into one of three groups.

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,073
There are people
who like their spaghetti sauce plain;

171
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,796
there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;

172
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,064
and there are people
who like it extra chunky.

173
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:00,796
And of those three facts,
the third one was the most significant,

174
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,474
because at the time, in the early 1980s,

175
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,998
if you went to a supermarket,

176
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:08,337
you would not find
extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.

177
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:10,820
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,

178
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:13,541
"You're telling me
that one third of Americans

179
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,796
crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce

180
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,319
and yet no one is servicing their needs?"

181
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:20,367
And he said "Yes!"

182
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,683
(Laughter)

183
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:23,049
And Prego then went back,

184
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,445
and completely reformulated
their spaghetti sauce,

185
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,123
and came out with a line of extra chunky
that immediately and completely

186
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:32,131
took over the spaghetti sauce
business in this country.

187
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:36,558
And over the next 10 years,
they made 600 million dollars

188
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,979
off their line of extra-chunky sauces.

189
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,310
Everyone else in the industry looked
at Howard had done, and they said,

190
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,741
"Oh my god! We've been
thinking all wrong!"

191
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:49,035
And that's when you started to get
seven different kinds of vinegar,

192
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:54,525
and 14 different kinds of mustard,
and 71 different kinds of olive oil.

193
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,796
And then eventually
even Ragù hired Howard,

194
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,011
and Howard did the exact same thing
for Ragù that he did for Prego.

195
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,386
And today, if you go
to a really good supermarket,

196
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,553
do you know how many Ragùs there are?

197
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:06,577
36!

198
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,357
In six varieties:

199
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,431
Cheese, Light,

200
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,557
Robusto, Rich & Hearty,

201
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,891
Old World Traditional --

202
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,020
Extra-Chunky Garden.

203
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,796
(Laughter)

204
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,564
That's Howard's doing.

205
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,796
That is Howard's gift
to the American people.

206
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,501
Now why is that important?

207
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,796
(Laughter)

208
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,901
It is, in fact, enormously important.

209
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,295
I'll explain to you why.

210
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:38,440
What Howard did is he fundamentally
changed the way the food industry thinks

211
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,885
about making you happy.

212
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,796
Assumption number one
in the food industry used to be

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,520
that the way to find out
what people want to eat,

214
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,881
what will make people happy,
is to ask them.

215
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,106
And for years and years and years,

216
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,368
Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,

217
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,852
and they would sit you down,
and they would say,

218
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,749
"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?

219
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,848
Tell us what you want
in a spaghetti sauce."

220
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,796
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --

221
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,796
through all those focus group sessions,

222
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,841
no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.

223
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,025
Even though at least a third of them,
deep in their hearts, actually did.

224
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,842
(Laughter)

225
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,528
People don't know what they want!

226
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,998
As Howard loves to say,

227
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,774
"The mind knows not
what the tongue wants."

228
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:21,950
It's a mystery!

229
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:22,978
(Laughter)

230
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:25,408
And a critically important step

231
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:28,763
in understanding
our own desires and tastes

232
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:32,419
is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want, deep down.

233
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:37,098
If I asked all of you, for example,
in this room, what you want in a coffee,

234
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,450
you know what you'd say?

235
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:42,713
Every one of you would say,
"I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."

236
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,533
It's what people always say
when you ask them.

237
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,089
"What do you like?"
"Dark, rich, hearty roast!"

238
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,626
What percentage of you actually
like a dark, rich, hearty roast?

239
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,698
According to Howard, somewhere
between 25 and 27 percent of you.

240
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:57,582
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.

241
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:58,607
(Laughter)

242
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:01,963
But you will never, ever say
to someone who asks you what you want

243
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:04,178
that "I want a milky, weak coffee."

244
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,101
So that's number one thing
that Howard did.

245
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:11,796
Number two thing that Howard did
is he made us realize --

246
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,796
it's another very critical point --

247
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,994
he made us realize the importance

248
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:19,017
of what he likes to call
"horizontal segmentation."

249
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,835
Why is this critical?

250
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:24,557
Because this is the way the food industry
thought before Howard.

251
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:26,891
What were they obsessed with
in the early 80s?

252
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,455
They were obsessed with mustard.

253
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,796
In particular, they were obsessed
with the story of Grey Poupon.

254
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,021
Used to be, there were two mustards:
French's and Gulden's.

255
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,538
What were they? Yellow mustard.

256
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,577
What's in it?

257
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,655
Yellow mustard seeds,
turmeric, and paprika.

258
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,753
That was mustard.

259
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,302
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.

260
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,514
Right?

261
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:50,201
Much more volatile brown mustard seed,
some white wine, a nose hit,

262
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,163
much more delicate aromatics.

263
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,202
And what do they do?

264
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:58,025
They put it in a little tiny glass jar,
with a wonderful enameled label on it,

265
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,123
made it look French,

266
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:01,248
even though it's made
in Oxnard, California.

267
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,273
(Laughter)

268
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:06,796
And instead of charging a dollar fifty
for the eight-ounce bottle,

269
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,793
the way that French's and Gulden's did,

270
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:10,544
they decided to charge four dollars.

271
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:11,780
And they had those ads.

272
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,439
With the guy in the Rolls Royce,
eating the Grey Poupon.

273
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,249
Another pulls up, and says,
"Do you have any Grey Poupon?"

274
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:20,457
And the whole thing, after they did that,
Grey Poupon takes off!

275
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,005
Takes over the mustard business!

276
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,037
And everyone's take-home lesson from that

277
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:28,796
was that the way to make people happy

278
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,214
is to give them something
that is more expensive,

279
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:34,305
something to aspire to.

280
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,472
It's to make them turn their back
on what they think they like now,

281
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,915
and reach out for something
higher up the mustard hierarchy.

282
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,940
(Laughter)

283
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:45,176
A better mustard!
A more expensive mustard!

284
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,363
A mustard of more sophistication
and culture and meaning.

285
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,796
And Howard looked to that
and said, "That's wrong!"

286
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,577
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.

287
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:58,139
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,
on a horizontal plane.

288
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,338
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.

289
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,888
There is no perfect mustard
or imperfect mustard.

290
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:07,657
There are only different kinds of mustards
that suit different kinds of people.

291
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:13,013
He fundamentally democratized
the way we think about taste.

292
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:17,256
And for that, as well, we owe
Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.

293
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:21,514
Third thing that Howard did,
and perhaps the most important,

294
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:24,377
is Howard confronted the notion
of the Platonic dish.

295
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,402
(Laughter)

296
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:26,568
What do I mean by that?

297
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,148
(Laughter)

298
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,272
For the longest time in the food industry,

299
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,876
there was a sense that there was one way,

300
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,628
a perfect way, to make a dish.

301
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,105
You go to Chez Panisse,

302
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,412
they give you the red-tail sashimi
with roasted pumpkin seeds

303
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,289
in a something something reduction.

304
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,796
They don't give you five options
on the reduction.

305
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,414
They don't say, "Do you want
the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"

306
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:52,446
No!

307
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,017
You just get the reduction. Why?

308
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,603
Because the chef at Chez Panisse

309
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,215
has a Platonic notion
about red-tail sashimi.

310
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,121
"This is the way it ought to be."

311
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,796
And she serves it that way
time and time again,

312
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,082
and if you quarrel with her, she will say,

313
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:08,708
"You know what? You're wrong!

314
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,008
This is the best way it ought to be
in this restaurant."

315
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:15,471
Now that same idea fueled
the commercial food industry as well.

316
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:19,331
They had a Platonic notion
of what tomato sauce was.

317
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,796
And where did that come from?
It came from Italy.

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,839
Italian tomato sauce is what?

319
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:25,795
It's blended; it's thin.

320
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,660
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.

321
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,661
When we talked about "authentic
tomato sauce" in the 1970s,

322
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,494
we talked about Italian tomato sauce,

323
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,297
we talked about the earliest Ragùs,

324
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,473
which had no visible solids, right?

325
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,937
Which were thin, you just put a little bit

326
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,009
and it sunk down to the bottom
of the pasta.

327
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,225
That's what it was.

328
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,910
And why were we attached to that?

329
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,672
Because we thought
that what it took to make people happy

330
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:52,290
was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.

331
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:57,398
And B, we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce,

332
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:58,850
then they would embrace it.

333
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:01,608
And that's what would please
the maximum number of people.

334
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,394
In other words,

335
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,817
people in the cooking world
were looking for cooking universals.

336
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,594
They were looking for one way
to treat all of us.

337
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,198
And it's good reason for them
to be obsessed

338
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,604
with the idea of universals,

339
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,025
because all of science,

340
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,298
through the 19th century
and much of the 20th,

341
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:19,991
was obsessed with universals.

342
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:24,003
Psychologists, medical scientists,
economists

343
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:26,115
were all interested
in finding out the rules

344
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,329
that govern the way all of us behave.

345
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,477
But that changed, right?

346
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:34,112
What is the great revolution
in science of the last 10, 15 years?

347
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,651
It is the movement
from the search for universals

348
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,524
to the understanding of variability.

349
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,796
Now in medical science,
we don't want to know, necessarily,

350
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,521
just how cancer works,

351
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,796
we want to know how your cancer
is different from my cancer.

352
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,567
I guess my cancer different
from your cancer.

353
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:55,679
Genetics has opened the door
to the study of human variability.

354
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,798
What Howard Moskowitz
was doing was saying,

355
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:01,933
"This same revolution needs to happen
in the world of tomato sauce."

356
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,392
And for that, we owe him
a great vote of thanks.

357
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,863
I'll give you one last
illustration of variability,

358
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,728
and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:15,240
Howard not only believed that,
but he took it a second step,

360
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:20,416
which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food,

361
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,060
we aren't just making an error;

362
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,432
we are actually doing ourselves
a massive disservice.

363
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,630
And the example he used was coffee.

364
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:32,088
And coffee is something he did
a lot of work with, with Nescafé.

365
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:36,064
If I were to ask all of you to try
and come up with a brand of coffee --

366
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:39,110
a type of coffee, a brew --
that made all of you happy,

367
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:41,087
and then I asked you to rate that coffee,

368
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:45,168
the average score in this room for coffee
would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.

369
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:49,268
If, however, you allowed me
to break you into coffee clusters,

370
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,077
maybe three or four coffee clusters,

371
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:55,796
and I could make coffee just
for each of those individual clusters,

372
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,375
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.

373
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,057
The difference between coffee
at 60 and coffee at 78

374
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,796
is a difference between coffee
that makes you wince,

375
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,824
and coffee that makes you
deliriously happy.

376
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,704
That is the final, and I think
most beautiful lesson,

377
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:16,063
of Howard Moskowitz:

378
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:19,796
that in embracing the diversity
of human beings,

379
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,185
we will find a surer way
to true happiness.

380
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,606
Thank you.

381
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,796
(Applause)
