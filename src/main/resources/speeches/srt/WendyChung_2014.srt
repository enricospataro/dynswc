1
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,051
"Why?"

2
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:15,509
"Why?" is a question

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,145
that parents ask me all the time.

4
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:20,992
"Why did my child develop autism?"

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,446
As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,

6
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,889
we try and address that question.

7
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,838
But autism is not a single condition.

8
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:32,553
It's actually a spectrum of disorders,

9
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:35,087
a spectrum that ranges, for instance,

10
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,760
from Justin, a 13-year-old boy

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,983
who's not verbal, who can't speak,

12
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,945
who communicates by using an iPad

13
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:44,843
to touch pictures to communicate

14
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,994
his thoughts and his concerns,

15
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:49,405
a little boy who, when he gets upset,

16
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:51,053
will start rocking,

17
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:52,650
and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,253
will bang his head to the point

19
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:58,095
that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.

20
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:00,710
That same diagnosis of autism, though,

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,632
also applies to Gabriel,

22
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:04,599
another 13-year-old boy

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,294
who has quite a different set of challenges.

24
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,408
He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.

25
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:12,429
He can multiple three numbers by three numbers

26
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,216
in his head with ease,

27
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,974
yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,

28
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,035
he has great difficulty.

29
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:22,094
He doesn't make eye contact.

30
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:24,217
He has difficulty starting a conversation,

31
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,952
feels awkward,

32
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,770
and when he gets nervous,

33
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,495
he actually shuts down.

34
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:30,977
Yet both of these boys

35
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:35,161
have the same diagnosis of
autism spectrum disorder.

36
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,589
One of the things that concerns us

37
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,186
is whether or not there really is

38
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,159
an epidemic of autism.

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,639
These days, one in 88 children

40
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,681
will be diagnosed with autism,

41
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,154
and the question is,

42
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,157
why does this graph look this way?

43
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:51,124
Has that number been increasing

44
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,058
dramatically over time?

45
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:57,589
Or is it because we have now started labeling

46
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:59,151
individuals with autism,

47
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,399
simply giving them a diagnosis

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,952
when they were still present there before

49
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:06,345
yet simply didn't have that label?

50
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:10,336
And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,

51
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:11,746
legislation was passed

52
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:14,385
that actually provided individuals with autism

53
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,111
with resources, with access to educational materials

54
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:19,883
that would help them.

55
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:23,371
With that increased awareness, more parents,

56
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,117
more pediatricians, more educators

57
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:29,372
learned to recognize the features of autism.

58
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:33,382
As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed

59
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:36,570
and got access to the resources they needed.

60
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,002
In addition, we've changed our definition over time,

61
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:43,140
so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,

62
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,260
and that accounts for some of

63
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,275
the increased prevalence that we see.

64
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,935
The next question everyone wonders is,

65
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,711
what caused autism?

66
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,606
And a common misconception

67
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:57,390
is that vaccines cause autism.

68
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,441
But let me be very clear:

69
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:04,928
Vaccines do not cause autism.

70
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:11,632
(Applause)

71
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,755
In fact, the original research study

72
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,754
that suggested that was the case

73
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:18,629
was completely fraudulent.

74
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,805
It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,

75
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,397
in which it was published,

76
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,287
and that author, a physician,

77
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,541
had his medical license taken away from him.

78
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,495
(Applause)

79
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,077
The Institute of Medicine,

80
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,640
The Centers for Disease Control,

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,984
have repeatedly investigated this

82
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,591
and there is no credible evidence

83
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:44,276
that vaccines cause autism.

84
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:45,913
Furthermore,

85
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,382
one of the ingredients in vaccines,

86
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:50,434
something called thimerosal,

87
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,750
was thought to be what the cause of autism was.

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,013
That was actually removed from vaccines

89
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,738
in the year 1992,

90
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,782
and you can see that it really did not have an effect

91
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,421
in what happened with the prevalence of autism.

92
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:05,154
So again, there is no evidence

93
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,236
that this is the answer.

94
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:11,379
So the question remains, what does cause autism?

95
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,210
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.

96
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,967
Just as autism is a spectrum,

97
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,157
there's a spectrum of etiologies,

98
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,809
a spectrum of causes.

99
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,800
Based on epidemiological data,

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,593
we know that one of the causes,

101
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,750
or one of the associations, I should say,

102
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,034
is advanced paternal age,

103
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,971
that is, increasing age of the father

104
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,150
at the time of conception.

105
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,294
In addition, another vulnerable

106
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,924
and critical period in terms of development

107
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,830
is when the mother is pregnant.

108
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,820
During that period, while
the fetal brain is developing,

109
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,762
we know that exposure to certain agents

110
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,847
can actually increase the risk of autism.

111
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,782
In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,

112
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,368
which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,

113
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:56,040
we know can increase that risk of autism.

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,339
In addition, there can be some infectious agents

115
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,239
that can also cause autism.

116
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,819
And one of the things I'm going to spend

117
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,880
a lot of time focusing on

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,441
are the genes that can cause autism.

119
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,897
I'm focusing on this not because genes

120
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,041
are the only cause of autism,

121
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,610
but it's a cause of autism

122
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,487
that we can readily define

123
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:18,280
and be able to better understand the biology

124
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,549
and understand better how the brain works

125
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,534
so that we can come up with strategies

126
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,864
to be able to intervene.

127
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:27,810
One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,

128
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,958
however, is the difference that we see

129
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,864
in terms of males and females.

130
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,869
Males are affected four to one compared to females

131
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,971
with autism,

132
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,962
and we really don't understand what that cause is.

133
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,680
One of the ways that we can understand

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,543
that genetics is a factor

135
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,880
is by looking at something called

136
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,770
the concordance rate.

137
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,958
In other words, if one sibling has autism,

138
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,445
what's the probability

139
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:55,449
that another sibling in that family will have autism?

140
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,014
And we can look in particular

141
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,182
at three types of siblings:

142
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:01,053
identical twins,

143
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,272
twins that actually share 100 percent

144
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,874
of their genetic information

145
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:08,050
and shared the same intrauterine environment,

146
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,295
versus fraternal twins,

147
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,284
twins that actually share 50 percent

148
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:14,311
of their genetic information,

149
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,527
versus regular siblings,

150
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,396
brother-sister, sister-sister,

151
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,264
also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,

152
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:23,343
yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.

153
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,643
And when you look at those concordance ratios,

154
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,700
one of the striking things that you will see

155
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,820
is that in identical twins,

156
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,173
that concordance rate is 77 percent.

157
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:34,277
Remarkably, though,

158
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,425
it's not 100 percent.

159
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:40,428
It is not that genes account
for all of the risk for autism,

160
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,669
but yet they account for a lot of that risk,

161
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,982
because when you look at fraternal twins,

162
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:48,058
that concordance rate is only 31 percent.

163
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,969
On the other hand, there is a difference

164
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:52,912
between those fraternal twins and the siblings,

165
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,576
suggesting that there are common exposures

166
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:56,999
for those fraternal twins

167
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,116
that may not be shared as commonly

168
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,290
with siblings alone.

169
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,976
So this provides some of the data

170
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:04,598
that autism is genetic.

171
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,562
Well, how genetic is it?

172
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:08,405
When we compare it to other conditions

173
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,017
that we're familiar with,

174
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,897
things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

175
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:17,850
in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism

176
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,290
than it does in any of these other conditions.

177
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,632
But with this, that doesn't
tell us what the genes are.

178
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,299
It doesn't even tell us in any one child,

179
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,960
is it one gene

180
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,216
or potentially a combination of genes?

181
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,770
And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,

182
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,284
it is genetic!

183
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:38,514
That is, that it is one single,

184
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,686
powerful, deterministic gene

185
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,533
that causes the autism.

186
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,327
However, in other individuals,

187
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,033
it's genetic, that is,

188
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,153
that it's actually a combination of genes

189
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,948
in part with the developmental process

190
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:55,328
that ultimately determines that risk for autism.

191
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:58,198
We don't know in any one person, necessarily,

192
00:07:58,198 --> 00:08:00,291
which of those two answers it is

193
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,332
until we start digging deeper.

194
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:03,619
So the question becomes,

195
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,860
how can we start to identify

196
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,732
what exactly those genes are.

197
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:08,841
And let me pose something

198
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,031
that might not be intuitive.

199
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,390
In certain individuals,

200
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,114
they can have autism

201
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,567
for a reason that is genetic

202
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:21,131
but yet not because of autism running in the family.

203
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,510
And the reason is because in certain individuals,

204
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,571
they can actually have genetic changes or mutations

205
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:29,614
that are not passed down from the mother

206
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,101
or from the father,

207
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,834
but actually start brand new in them,

208
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,421
mutations that are present

209
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,824
in the egg or the sperm

210
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,437
at the time of conception

211
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,179
but have not been passed down

212
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,185
generation through generation within the family.

213
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,366
And we can actually use that strategy

214
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,700
to now understand and to identify

215
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,800
those genes causing autism in those individuals.

216
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,810
So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,

217
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,536
we took 2,600 individuals

218
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,247
that had no family history of autism,

219
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,417
and we took that child and their mother and father

220
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,888
and used them to try and understand

221
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,507
what were those genes

222
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,825
causing autism in those cases?

223
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:10,892
To do that, we actually had to comprehensively

224
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:13,622
be able to look at all that genetic information

225
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,804
and determine what those differences were

226
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:19,505
between the mother, the father and the child.

227
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,459
In doing so, I apologize,

228
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,343
I'm going to use an outdated analogy

229
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:26,001
of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,

230
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,000
but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,358
that as we did this inventory,

232
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:32,951
we needed to be able to look at

233
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:35,124
massive amounts of information.

234
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,411
Our genetic information is organized

235
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,298
into a set of 46 volumes,

236
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,207
and when we did that, we had to be able to account

237
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,191
for each of those 46 volumes,

238
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,044
because in some cases with autism,

239
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,500
there's actually a single volume that's missing.

240
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,810
We had to get more granular than that, though,

241
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,130
and so we had to start opening those books,

242
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,010
and in some cases, the genetic change

243
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,398
was more subtle.

244
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:59,584
It might have been a single
paragraph that was missing,

245
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:02,862
or yet, even more subtle than that,

246
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,554
a single letter,

247
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,356
one out of three billion letters

248
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,630
that was changed, that was altered,

249
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,227
yet had profound effects

250
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,140
in terms of how the brain functions

251
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,957
and affects behavior.

252
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,334
In doing this within these families,

253
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,652
we were able to account for approximately

254
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,977
25 percent of the individuals

255
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:24,524
and determine that there was a single

256
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,720
powerful genetic factor

257
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,844
that caused autism within those families.

258
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:32,096
On the other hand, there's 75 percent

259
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,547
that we still haven't figured out.

260
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,017
As we did this, though,

261
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,111
it was really quite humbling,

262
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,476
because we realized that there was not simply

263
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,417
one gene for autism.

264
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,166
In fact, the current estimates are

265
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,918
that there are 200 to 400 different genes

266
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,810
that can cause autism.

267
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,179
And that explains, in part,

268
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,296
why we see such a broad spectrum

269
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:54,339
in terms of its effects.

270
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,564
Although there are that many genes,

271
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,912
there is some method to the madness.

272
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,860
It's not simply random

273
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,090
200, 400 different genes,

274
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,884
but in fact they fit together.

275
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,750
They fit together in a pathway.

276
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,222
They fit together in a network

277
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,054
that's starting to make sense now

278
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:12,752
in terms of how the brain functions.

279
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,898
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach

280
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,607
where we're identifying those genes,

281
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,085
those proteins, those molecules,

282
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,995
understanding how they interact together

283
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,392
to make that neuron work,

284
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:25,129
understanding how those neurons interact together

285
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,348
to make circuits work,

286
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:28,364
and understand how those circuits work

287
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,190
to now control behavior,

288
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,990
and understand that both in individuals with autism

289
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,891
as well as individuals who have normal cognition.

290
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,349
But early diagnosis is a key for us.

291
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,308
Being able to make that diagnosis

292
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:42,815
of someone who's susceptible

293
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,870
at a time in a window

294
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,217
where we have the ability to transform,

295
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,820
to be able to impact

296
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,560
that growing, developing brain is critical.

297
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,369
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods

298
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,937
to be able to take infants, small babies,

299
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:00,470
and be able to use biomarkers,

300
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,808
in this case eye contact and eye tracking,

301
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,894
to identify an infant at risk.

302
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,059
This particular infant, you can see,

303
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,260
making very good eye contact with this woman

304
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,620
as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"

305
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,660
in fact is not going to develop autism.

306
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,540
This baby we know is going to be in the clear.

307
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,900
On the other hand, this other baby

308
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,235
is going to go on to develop autism.

309
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:25,462
In this particular child, you can see,

310
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:27,663
it's not making good eye contact.

311
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,630
Instead of the eyes focusing in

312
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,908
and having that social connection,

313
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,546
looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,

314
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,329
looking off in another direction,

315
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,242
but not again socially connecting,

316
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,955
and being able to do this on a very large scale,

317
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,955
screen infants, screen children for autism,

318
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,879
through something very robust, very reliable,

319
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,595
is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being

320
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,689
able to intervene at an early stage

321
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,121
when we can have the greatest impact.

322
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,367
How are we going to intervene?

323
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,197
It's probably going to be a combination of factors.

324
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,236
In part, in some individuals,

325
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,115
we're going to try and use medications.

326
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:07,837
And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism

327
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,363
is important for us

328
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,229
to identify drug targets,

329
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,852
to identify things that we might be able to impact

330
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,550
and can be certain that that's really

331
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,245
what we need to do in autism.

332
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,986
But that's not going to be the only answer.

333
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,496
Beyond just drugs, we're going
to use educational strategies.

334
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:24,771
Individuals with autism,

335
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,068
some of them are wired a little bit differently.

336
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,927
They learn in a different way.

337
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,261
They absorb their surroundings in a different way,

338
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,480
and we need to be able to educate them

339
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,573
in a way that serves them best.

340
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,491
Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals

341
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,637
in this room who have great ideas

342
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:43,181
in terms of new technologies we can use,

343
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,300
everything from devices we can use to train the brain

344
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,849
to be able to make it more efficient

345
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:49,522
and to compensate for areas in which

346
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:51,116
it has a little bit of trouble,

347
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:53,395
to even things like Google Glass.

348
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,179
You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,

349
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,000
with his social awkwardness,

350
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,458
might be able to wear Google Glass

351
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,989
with an earpiece in his ear,

352
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,916
and have a coach be able to help him,

353
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,574
be able to help think about conversations,

354
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:05,890
conversation-starters,

355
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,001
being able to even perhaps one day

356
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,369
invite a girl out on a date.

357
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,581
All of these new technologies

358
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,587
just offer tremendous opportunities

359
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,492
for us to be able to impact

360
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,177
the individuals with autism,

361
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,713
but yet we have a long way to go.

362
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,023
As much as we know,

363
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:25,980
there is so much more that we don't know,

364
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,113
and so I invite all of you

365
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,355
to be able to help us think about

366
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:31,766
how to do this better,

367
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,645
to use as a community our collective wisdom

368
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,451
to be able to make a difference,

369
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,708
and in particular,

370
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,412
for the individuals in families with autism,

371
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,667
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,

372
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,861
to be part of the solution to this,

373
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:48,740
because it's going to take really a lot of us

374
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,010
to think about what's important,

375
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,935
what's going to be a meaningful difference.

376
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,440
As we think about something

377
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,272
that's potentially a solution,

378
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:57,931
how well does it work?

379
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,879
Is it something that's really
going to make a difference

380
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,248
in your lives, as an individual,

381
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:03,901
as a family with autism?

382
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,321
We're going to need individuals of all ages,

383
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,048
from the young to the old,

384
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:10,207
and with all different shapes and sizes

385
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,044
of the autism spectrum disorder

386
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,220
to make sure that we can have an impact.

387
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,425
So I invite all of you to join the mission

388
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:19,399
and to help to be able to make the lives

389
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,085
of individuals with autism

390
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,016
so much better and so much richer.

391
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:25,741
Thank you.

392
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:29,741
(Applause)
