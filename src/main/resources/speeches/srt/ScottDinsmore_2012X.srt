1
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,076
Wow, what an honor. I always wondered
what this would feel like.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,875
So eight years ago,
I got the worst career advice of my life.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,356
I had a friend tell me,

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,316
"Don't worry about how much
you like the work you're doing now.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,356
It's all about just building your resume."

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,036
And I'd just come back
from living in Spain for a while,

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,394
and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company.
I thought, "This is fantastic.

8
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,434
I'm going to have
big impact on the world".

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,156
I had all these ideas.
And within about two months,

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
I noticed at about 10 a.m. every morning
I had this strange urge

11
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:43,756
to want to slam my head
through the monitor of my computer.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,685
I don't know if anyone's ever felt that.

13
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:49,236
And I noticed pretty soon after that
that all the competitors in our space

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,156
had already automated my job role.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,396
And this is right about when I got
this sage advice to build up my resume.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,436
Well, as I'm trying to figure out

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,956
what two-story window I'm going
to jump out of and change things up,

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,716
I read some altogether different advice
from Warren Buffett, and he said,

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,356
"Taking jobs to build up your resume
is the same as saving up sex for old age."

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,116
(Laughter)

21
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,436
And I heard that,
and that was all I needed.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,676
Within two weeks, I was out of there,
and I left with one intention:

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,756
to find something that I could screw up.
That's how tough it was.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,796
I wanted to have some type of an impact.
It didn't matter what it was.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,535
And I found pretty quickly
that I wasn't alone:

26
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,396
it turns out that over 80 percent
of the people around

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,916
don't enjoy their work.

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,476
I'm guessing this room is different,

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,356
but that's the average
that Deloitte has done with their studies.

30
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,428
So I wanted to find out,
what is it that sets these people apart,

31
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,788
the people who do the passionate,
world-changing work,

32
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,436
that wake up inspired every day,

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,236
and then these people,
the other 80 percent

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,316
who lead these lives of quiet desperation.

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,596
So I started to interview all these people
doing this inspiring work,

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,436
and I read books and did case studies,

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,156
300 books altogether
on purpose and career and all this,

38
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,500
totally just self-immersion,
really for the selfish reason of --

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,556
I wanted to find the work
that I couldn't not do,

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,116
what that was for me.

41
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,782
But as I was doing this,
more and more people started to ask me,

42
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:12,276
"You're into this career thing.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,516
I don't like my job.
Can we sit down for lunch?"

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,716
I'd say, "Sure,"
but I would have to warn them,

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,036
because at this point,
my quit rate was also 80 percent.

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,286
Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch,
80 percent would quit their job

47
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,476
within two months.

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,716
I was proud of this, and it wasn't
that I had any special magic.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,788
It was that I would ask
one simple question.

50
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:32,428
It was, "Why are you doing
the work that you're doing?"

51
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,556
And so often their answer would be,

52
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,876
"Well, because somebody
told me I'm supposed to."

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,036
And I realized that so many
people around us

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,676
are climbing their way up this ladder
that someone tells them to climb,

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,236
and it ends up being leaned up
against the wrong wall,

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,916
or no wall at all.

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,636
The more time I spent around
these people and saw this problem,

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,876
I thought, what if we could
create a community,

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,276
a place where people
could feel like they belonged

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,443
and that it was OK
to do things differently,

61
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,182
to take the road less traveled,
where that was encouraged,

62
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,756
and inspire people to change?

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,476
And that later became
what I now call Live Your Legend,

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,167
which I'll explain in a little bit.

65
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:09,876
But as I've made these discoveries,
I noticed a framework

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,281
of really three simple things

67
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,436
that all these different passionate
world-changers have in common,

68
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,116
whether you're a Steve Jobs
or if you're just, you know,

69
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,196
the person that has
the bakery down the street,

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,236
but you're doing work
that embodies who you are.

71
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,156
I want to share those three with you,
so we can use them as a lens

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,847
for the rest of today
and hopefully the rest of our life.

73
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,647
The first part of this three-step
passionate work framework

74
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:32,596
is becoming a self-expert
and understanding yourself,

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,276
because if you don't know
what you're looking for,

76
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,916
you're never going to find it.

77
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,560
And the thing is that no one
is going to do this for us.

78
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:43,276
There's no major in university
on passion and purpose and career.

79
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,556
I don't know how that's not
a required double major,

80
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,396
but don't even get me started on that.

81
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,396
I mean, you spend more time
picking out a dorm room TV set

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,356
than you do you picking your major
and your area of study.

83
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,996
But the point is,
it's on us to figure that out,

84
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,236
and we need a framework,
we need a way to navigate through this.

85
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,118
And so the first step of our compass is
finding out what our unique strengths are.

86
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,156
What are the things that we wake up
loving to do no matter what,

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,676
whether we're paid or we're not paid,
the things that people thank us for?

88
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,676
And the Strengths Finder 2.0
is a book and also an online tool.

89
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,436
I highly recommend it for sorting out
what it is that you're naturally good at.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,876
And next, what's our framework
or our hierarchy for making decisions?

91
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,116
Do we care about the people,
our family, health,

92
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,276
or is it achievement, success,
all this stuff?

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,967
We have to figure out what it is
to make these decisions,

94
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,716
so we know what our soul is made of,

95
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,436
so that we don't go selling it
to some cause we don't give a shit about.

96
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,156
And then the next step is our experiences.

97
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,636
All of us have these experiences.
We learn things every day, every minute

98
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,356
about what we love, what we hate,

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
what we're good at,
what we're terrible at,

100
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,796
and if we don't spend time
paying attention to that

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,356
and assimilating that learning

102
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,356
and applying it to the rest of our lives,
it's all for nothing.

103
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,036
Every day, every week,
every month of every year

104
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,516
I spend some time
just reflecting on what went right,

105
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,683
what went wrong,
and what do I want to repeat,

106
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,283
what can I apply more to my life?

107
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:06,396
And even more so than that,
as you see people, especially today,

108
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,801
who inspire you, who are doing
things where you say

109
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,756
"Oh God, what Jeff is doing,
I want to be like him."

110
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,501
Why are you saying that?
Open up a journal.

111
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,596
Write down what it is about them
that inspires you.

112
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,676
It's not going to be
everything about their life,

113
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,516
but whatever it is, take note on that,

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,836
so over time we'll have
this repository of things

115
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,076
that we can use to apply to our life
and have a more passionate existence

116
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,596
and make a better impact.

117
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,001
Because when we start
to put these things together,

118
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,316
we can then define
what success actually means to us,

119
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,476
and without these different parts
of the compass, it's impossible.

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,120
We end up in the situation --
we have that scripted life

121
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:42,276
that everybody seems to be living
going up this ladder to nowhere.

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,956
It's kind of like in Wall Street 2,
if anybody saw that,

123
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,796
the peon employee asks
the big Wall Street banker CEO,

124
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,956
"What's your number?
Everyone's got a number,

125
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,516
where if they make this money,
they'll leave it all."

126
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,060
He says, "Oh, it's simple. More."

127
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,236
And he just smiles.

128
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,036
And it's the sad state
of most of the people

129
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,596
that haven't spent time
understanding what matters for them,

130
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,356
who keep reaching for something
that doesn't mean anything to us,

131
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,876
but we're doing it because everyone
said we're supposed to.

132
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,636
But once we have this framework together,

133
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,276
we can start to identify
the things that make us come alive.

134
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,516
You know, before this, a passion
could come and hit you in the face,

135
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,236
or maybe in your possible line of work,
you might throw it away

136
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,451
because you don't have
a way of identifying it.

137
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:24,011
But once you do, you can see something
that's congruent with my strengths,

138
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,836
my values, who I am as a person,

139
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,146
so I'm going to grab ahold of this,
I'm going to do something with it,

140
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,028
and I'm going to pursue it
and try to make an impact with it.

141
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:34,596
And Live Your Legend
and the movement we've built

142
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,287
wouldn't exist if I didn't have
this compass to identify,

143
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,556
"Wow, this is something I want to pursue
and make a difference with."

144
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,636
If we don't know what we're looking for,
we're never going to find it,

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,196
but once we have
this framework, this compass,

146
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,676
then we can move on to what's next --
and that's not me up there --

147
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,916
doing the impossible
and pushing our limits.

148
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,956
There's two reasons
why people don't do things.

149
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,956
One is they tell themselves
they can't do them,

150
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,116
or people around them
tell them they can't do them.

151
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,676
Either way, we start to believe it.

152
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,076
Either we give up,
or we never start in the first place.

153
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,996
The things is, everyone was impossible
until somebody did it.

154
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,556
Every invention,
every new thing in the world,

155
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,247
people thought were crazy at first.

156
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:13,700
Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile,
it was a physical impossibility

157
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,116
to break the four-minute mile
in a foot race

158
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,156
until Roger Bannister stood up and did it.

159
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,396
And then what happened?

160
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,036
Two months later,
16 people broke the four-minute mile.

161
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,796
The things that we have in our head
that we think are impossible

162
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,956
are often just milestones
waiting to be accomplished

163
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,600
if we can push those limits a bit,

164
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:31,996
and I think this starts with probably
your physical body and fitness

165
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,556
more than anything,
because we can control that.

166
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,196
If you don't think you can run a mile,

167
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,276
you show yourself
you can run a mile or two,

168
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,836
or a marathon, or lose five pounds,
or whatever it is,

169
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,356
you realize that confidence compounds

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,876
and can be transferred
into the rest of your world.

171
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,556
And I've actually gotten into the habit
of this a little bit with my friends.

172
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,316
We have this little group.
We go on physical adventures,

173
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,436
and recently, I found myself
in a kind of precarious spot.

174
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,476
I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.

175
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,516
I don't know if anyone's ever had
that same fear

176
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,139
ever since they watched
Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times

177
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,316
when I was a kid.

178
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,876
But anything above here, if it's murky,
I can already feel it right now.

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,676
I swear there's something in there.

180
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,836
Even if it's Lake Tahoe,
it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,

181
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,516
ridiculous, but it's there.

182
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,036
Anyway, three years ago
I find myself on this tugboat

183
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,036
right down here in the San Francisco Bay.

184
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,516
It's a rainy, stormy, windy day,
and people are getting sick on the boat,

185
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,874
and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit,
and I'm looking out the window

186
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,876
in pure terror thinking
I'm about to swim to my death.

187
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,156
I'm going to try to swim
across the Golden Gate,

188
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,996
and my guess is some people in this room
might have done that before.

189
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,236
I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan,
who had talked me into it,

190
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,516
he comes up to me
and he could see the state I was in,

191
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,276
and he says, "Scott, hey man,
what's the worst that could happen?

192
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,436
You're wearing a wetsuit.
You're not going to sink.

193
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,276
And If you can't make it,
just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.

194
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,116
Plus, if there's a shark attack,
why are they going to pick you

195
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,760
over the 80 people in the water?"
So thanks, that helps.

196
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,640
He's like, "But really,
just have fun with this. Good luck."

197
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,156
And he dives in, swims off. OK.

198
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,556
Turns out, the pep talk totally worked,
and I felt this total feeling of calm,

199
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,516
and I think it was because
Jonathan was 13 years old.

200
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,476
(Laughter)

201
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,196
And of the 80 people swimming that day,

202
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,036
65 of them were between
the ages of nine and 13.

203
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,796
Think how you would have approached
your world differently

204
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,996
if at nine years old you found out
you could swim a mile and a half

205
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,716
in 56-degree water
from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

206
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,156
What would you have said yes to?

207
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,036
What would you have not given up on?
What would you have tried?

208
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,156
As I'm finishing this swim,
I get to Aquatic Park,

209
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,556
and I'm getting out of the water

210
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,676
and of course half the kids
are already finished,

211
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,034
so they're cheering me on
and they're all excited,

212
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:39,074
and I got total popsicle head,
if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,

213
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,596
and I'm trying to just thaw my face out,
and I'm watching people finish,

214
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,636
and I see this one kid,
something didn't look right,

215
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,676
and he's just flailing like this,

216
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,116
and he's barely able to sip some air
before he slams his head back down,

217
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,356
and I notice other parents
were watching too,

218
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,836
and I swear they were thinking
the same thing I was:

219
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,796
this is why you don't let nine-year-olds
swim from Alcatraz.

220
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,036
This was not fatigue.

221
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,356
All of a sudden, two parents
run up and grab him,

222
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,156
and they put him on their shoulders,
and they're dragging him like this,

223
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,036
totally limp,

224
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,396
and then all of a sudden
they walk a few more feet

225
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,396
and they plop him down in his wheelchair.

226
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,956
And he puts his fists up in the most
insane show of victory I've ever seen.

227
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,636
I can still feel the warmth
and the energy on this guy

228
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,236
when he made this accomplishment.

229
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,236
I had seen him earlier that day
in his wheelchair.

230
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,236
I just had no idea he was going to swim.

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,356
I mean, where is he
going to be in 20 years?

232
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,796
How many people told him he couldn't
do that, that he would die if tried that?

233
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,956
You prove people wrong,
you prove yourself wrong,

234
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,796
that you can make
little incremental pushes

235
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,356
of what you believe is possible.

236
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,796
You don't have to be
the fastest marathoner in the world,

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,201
just your own impossibilities,
to accomplish those,

238
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,201
and it starts with little bitty steps,

239
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,556
and the best way to do this

240
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,796
is to surround yourself
with passionate people.

241
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,582
The fastest things to do things
you don't think can be done

242
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:55,178
is to surround yourself
with people already doing them.

243
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:57,636
There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says

244
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,036
"You are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with."

245
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,356
And there is no bigger lifehack
in the history of the world

246
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,436
from getting where you are today
to where you want to be

247
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,356
than the people you choose
to put in your corner.

248
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,676
They change everything,
and it's a proven fact.

249
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,996
In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study
with a bunch of cyclists,

250
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,820
and he would measure their times
around the track in a group,

251
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,996
and also individually,

252
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,716
and he found that every time the cyclists
in the group would cycle faster.

253
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,556
And it's been repeated
in all kinds of walks of life since then,

254
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,476
and it proves the same thing over again,

255
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,356
that the people around you matter,
and environment is everything,

256
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,956
but it's on you to control it,
because it can go both ways.

257
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,556
With 80 percent of people
who don't like the work they do,

258
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,756
that means most people around us,
not in this room, but everywhere else,

259
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,436
are encouraging complacency and keeping us
from pursuing the things that matter to us

260
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,516
so we have to manage those surroundings.

261
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
I found myself in this situation --

262
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,396
personal example, a couple years ago.

263
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,596
Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion
they poured their heart and soul into,

264
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,116
unbelievable amount of time, and they
so badly want to call it a business,

265
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,276
but no one's paying attention
and it doesn't make a dime?

266
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,396
OK, I was there for four years trying
to build this Live Your Legend movement

267
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,756
to help people do work that they genuinely
cared about and that inspired them,

268
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,116
and I was doing all I could,

269
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,316
and there were only
three people paying attention,

270
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,579
and they're all right there:
my mother, father, and my wife, Chelsea.

271
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:21,099
Thank you guys for the support.

272
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,596
(Applause)

273
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,316
And this is how badly I wanted it,
it grew at zero percent for four years,

274
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,316
and I was about to shut it down,

275
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,036
and right about then,

276
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,596
I moved to San Francisco and started
to meet some pretty interesting people

277
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,836
who had these crazy
lifestyles of adventure,

278
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,876
of businesses and websites and blogs

279
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,156
that surrounded their passions
and helped people in a meaningful way.

280
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,836
And one of my friends,
now, he has a family of eight,

281
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,196
and he supports his whole family

282
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,076
with a blog that he
writes for twice a week.

283
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,148
They just came back from a month
in Europe, all of them together.

284
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,236
This blew my mind.
How does this even exist?

285
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,756
And I got unbelievably inspired
by seeing this,

286
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,756
and instead of shutting it down,
I decided, let's take it seriously.

287
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,756
And I did everything I could
to spend my time,

288
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,276
every waking hour possible
trying to hound these guys,

289
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,076
hanging out and having beers
and workouts, whatever it was,

290
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,836
and after four years of zero growth,

291
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,196
within six months
of hanging around these people,

292
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,916
the community at Live Your Legend
grew by 10 times.

293
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,796
In another 12 months,
it grew by 160 times,

294
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,876
and today over 30,000 people
from 158 countries

295
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,996
use our career and connection tools
on a monthly basis.

296
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,396
And those people have made up
that community of passionate folks

297
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,636
who inspired that possibility
that I dreamed of

298
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,836
for Live Your Legend so many years back.

299
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,116
The people change everything,
and this is why --

300
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,356
You know, you ask what was going on.

301
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,836
Well, for four years,
I knew nobody in this space,

302
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,356
and I didn't even know it existed,
that people could do this stuff,

303
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,356
that you could have movements like this,

304
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,036
and then I'm over here in San Francisco,
and everyone around me was doing it.

305
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,156
It became normal, so my thinking went
from how could I possibly do this

306
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,996
to how could I possibly not,

307
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,236
and right then, when that happens,
that switch goes on in your head,

308
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,927
it ripples across your whole world.

309
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:05,876
And without even trying,
your standards go from here to here.

310
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,615
You don't need to change your goals.
You just need to change your surroundings.

311
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,996
That's it, and that's why I love
being around this whole group of people,

312
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,640
why I go to every TED event I can,

313
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,596
and watch them on my iPad
on the way to work, whatever it is,

314
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,036
because this is the group of people
that inspires possibility.

315
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,076
We have a whole day
to spend together and plenty more.

316
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,556
To sum things up,
in terms of these three pillars,

317
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,516
they all have one thing in common
more than anything else.

318
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,996
They are 100 percent in our control.

319
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,076
No one can tell you
you can't learn about yourself.

320
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,243
No one can tell you
you can't push your limits

321
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,556
and learn your own impossible
and push that.

322
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,516
No one can tell you you can't
surround yourself with inspiring people

323
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,731
or get away from the people
who bring you down.

324
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,184
You can't control a recession.

325
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,396
You can't control getting fired
or getting in a car accident.

326
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,516
Most things are totally out of our hands.

327
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,900
These three things are totally on us,

328
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,740
and they can change our whole world
if we decide to do something about it.

329
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
And the thing is, it's starting to happen
on a widespread level.

330
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:10,115
I just read in Forbes, the US Government
reported for the first time

331
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,836
in a month where more people
had quit their jobs

332
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,196
than had been laid off.

333
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,436
They thought this was an anomaly,
but it's happened three months straight.

334
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,156
In a time where people claim
it's kind of a tough environment,

335
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,516
people are giving a middle finger
to this scripted life,

336
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,596
the things that people
say you're supposed to do,

337
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,356
in exchange for things that matter to them
and do the things that inspire them.

338
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,156
And the thing is, people
are waking up to this possibility,

339
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,156
that really the only thing that limits
possibility now is imagination.

340
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,156
That's not a cliche anymore.

341
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,356
I don't care what it is that you're into,
what passion, what hobby.

342
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,836
If you're into knitting, you can find
someone who is killing it knitting,

343
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,196
and you can learn from them. It's wild.

344
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,716
And that's what this whole day is about,
to learn from the folks speaking,

345
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,156
and we profile these people
on Live Your Legend every day,

346
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,876
because when ordinary people
are doing the extraordinary,

347
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,676
and we can be around that,

348
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,436
it becomes normal.

349
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,556
And this isn't about being Gandhi
or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.

350
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,009
It's just about doing something
that matters to you,

351
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,073
and makes an impact
that only you can make.

352
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,076
Speaking of Gandhi,
he was a recovering lawyer,

353
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,436
as I've heard the term,

354
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,716
and he was called to a greater cause,
something that mattered to him,

355
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,956
he couldn't not do,

356
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,219
and he has this quote
that I absolutely live by.

357
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,556
"First they ignore you,
then they laugh at you,

358
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,700
then they fight you, then you win."

359
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,436
Everything was impossible
until somebody did it.

360
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,636
You can either hang around the people
who tell you it can't be done

361
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,476
and tell you you're stupid for trying,

362
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,796
or surround yourself with the people
who inspire possibility,

363
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,420
the people who are in this room.

364
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,316
Because I see it as our responsibility
to show the world

365
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,756
that what's seen as impossible
can become the new normal.

366
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,956
And that's already starting to happen.

367
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,676
First, do the things that inspire us,

368
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,396
so we can inspire other people
to do the things that inspire them.

369
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,060
But we can't find that

370
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,076
unless we know what we're looking for.

371
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,196
We have to do our work on ourself,

372
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,796
be intentional about that,
and make those discoveries.

373
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,344
Because I imagine a world where 80 percent
of people love the work they do.

374
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,676
What would that look like?

375
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,716
What would the innovation be like?
How would you treat the people around you?

376
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,120
Things would start to change.

377
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,836
And as we finish up,
I have just one question to ask you guys,

378
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,596
and I think it's the only
question that matters,

379
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,220
and it's, what is the work
you can't not do?

380
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,556
Discover that, live it,

381
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,260
not just for you,
but for everybody around you,

382
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,076
because that is what starts
to change the world.

383
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,420
What is the work you can't not do?

384
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,436
Thank you guys.

385
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,980
(Applause)
