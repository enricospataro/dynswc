1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,864
I grew up to study the brain

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,302
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed

3
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:19,272
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

4
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:23,237
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

5
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:27,554
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,

6
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,813
I can connect them to my reality,

7
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,503
and I can make my dreams come true?

8
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:36,304
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia

9
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:41,796
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
so they instead become delusion?

11
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:49,169
So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses.

12
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:52,796
And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston,

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,347
where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes,

14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,638
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.

15
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:01,796
And in the lab,
we were asking the question,

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,670
"What are the biological differences

17
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:08,796
between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control,

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,490
as compared with the brains of individuals

19
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:16,430
diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

20
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:20,945
So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:

21
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,071
which cells are communicating
with which cells,

22
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:25,629
with which chemicals,

23
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:29,002
and then in what quantities
of those chemicals?

24
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:31,255
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

25
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:34,787
because I was performing
this type of research during the day,

26
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,913
but then in the evenings
and on the weekends,

27
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:43,500
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

28
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,796
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,796
I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own.

30
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,720
A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain.

31
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,914
And in the course of four hours,

32
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:01,140
I watched my brain completely deteriorate

33
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,748
in its ability to process all information.

34
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,527
On the morning of the hemorrhage,

35
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:11,796
I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,796
If you've ever seen a human brain,

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,665
it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another.

39
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:26,209
And I have brought for you
a real human brain.

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,765
(Groaning, laughter)

41
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:39,265
So this is a real human brain.

42
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,796
This is the front of the brain,

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,265
the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down,

44
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:48,716
and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head.

45
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,276
And when you look at the brain,

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,309
it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices

47
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,023
are completely separate from one another.

48
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,796
For those of you who understand computers,

49
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,745
our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor,

50
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,499
while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.

51
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,867
The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another

52
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,446
through the corpus callosum,

53
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,664
which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers.

54
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:17,796
But other than that,

55
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,080
the two hemispheres
are completely separate.

56
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:24,796
Because they process
information differently,

57
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,796
each of our hemispheres
think about different things,

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,384
they care about different things,
and, dare I say,

59
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:33,823
they have very different personalities.

60
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,582
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.

61
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:41,906
Assistant: It has been.

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,486
(Laughter)

63
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:49,851
Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment.

64
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,796
It's all about "right here, right now."

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,796
Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,796
and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies.

67
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,796
Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously

68
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,796
through all of our sensory systems

69
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,796
and then it explodes
into this enormous collage

70
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,796
of what this present moment looks like,

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,796
what this present moment
smells like and tastes like,

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,796
what it feels like
and what it sounds like.

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,796
I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me

74
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,343
through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere.

75
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:35,676
We are energy-beings
connected to one another

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,471
through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres

77
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,820
as one human family.

78
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:45,344
And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet,

79
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,796
here to make the world a better place.

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,820
And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,796
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place.

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,958
Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically.

83
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:10,796
Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future.

84
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,796
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,412
that enormous collage
of the present moment

86
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:21,486
and start picking out details,
and more details about those details.

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,903
It then categorizes and organizes
all that information,

88
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,438
associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned,

89
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,220
and projects into the future
all of our possibilities.

90
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,796
And our left hemisphere
thinks in language.

91
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,748
It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world

92
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,796
to my external world.

93
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,586
It's that little voice that says to me,

94
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,398
"Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home.

95
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:52,796
I need them in the morning."

96
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,718
It's that calculating intelligence

97
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:58,561
that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry.

98
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:03,414
But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me,

99
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:07,269
"I am. I am."

100
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:11,288
And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am,"

101
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:12,926
I become separate.

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,205
I become a single solid individual,

103
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,524
separate from the energy flow around me

104
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:19,380
and separate from you.

105
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:24,213
And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke.

106
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:27,292
On the morning of the stroke,

107
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:31,615
I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye.

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,450
And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream.

109
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,319
And it just gripped me --

110
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,554
and then it released me.

111
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,689
And then it just gripped me --

112
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,440
and then it released me.

113
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:48,796
And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain,

114
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,392
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine."

115
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,796
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,

116
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,796
which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine.

117
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,245
And I'm jamming away on this thing,

118
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:05,038
and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws

119
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,530
grasping onto the bar.

120
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,545
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

121
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,025
And I looked down at my body

122
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:14,796
and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."

123
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,486
And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away

124
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,983
from my normal perception of reality,

125
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,984
where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience,

126
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:24,906
to some esoteric space

127
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,019
where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience.

128
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:32,040
And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse.

129
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,363
So I get off the machine,

130
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,796
and I'm walking
across my living room floor,

131
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,462
and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down.

132
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,922
And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate.

133
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,795
There's no fluidity to my pace,

134
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,747
and there's this constriction
in my area of perception,

135
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,796
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

136
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,351
And I'm standing in my bathroom

137
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,222
getting ready to step into the shower,

138
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,995
and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body.

139
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,796
I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract.

140
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,208
You muscles, you relax."

141
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:08,366
And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall.

142
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,335
And I look down at my arm

143
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:15,792
and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body.

144
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,604
I can't define where I begin
and where I end,

145
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:21,796
because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm

146
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,796
blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall.

147
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,796
And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy.

148
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,963
And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me?

149
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,766
What is going on?"

150
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:39,207
And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent.

151
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:43,503
Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button.

152
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,796
Total silence.

153
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,153
And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind.

154
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,416
But then I was immediately captivated

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
by the magnificence
of the energy around me.

156
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:01,098
And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body,

157
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:04,660
I felt enormous and expansive.

158
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:08,009
I felt at one with
all the energy that was,

159
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,199
and it was beautiful there.

160
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:13,065
Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online

161
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,296
and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem!

162
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,820
We've got to get some help."

163
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,872
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"

164
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,423
(Laughter)

165
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,438
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."

166
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:26,961
But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness --

167
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:30,820
and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land.

168
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,202
But it was beautiful there.

169
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:36,224
Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected

170
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:39,796
from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world.

171
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,662
So here I am in this space,

172
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:45,796
and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone.

173
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,137
And I felt lighter in my body.

174
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:52,796
And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world

175
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,796
and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone.

176
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,994
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

177
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,455
And imagine
what it would feel like to lose

178
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:06,217
37 years of emotional baggage!

179
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:11,796
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

180
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,671
euphoria.

181
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:14,796
It was beautiful.

182
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,446
And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says,

183
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,096
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,518
We've got to get help."

185
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,397
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus."

186
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,889
So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress

187
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,720
and I'm walking around my apartment,

188
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:31,796
and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"

189
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,089
And in that moment,

190
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,455
my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side.

191
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:39,796
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!"

192
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,439
And the next thing my brain says to me is,

193
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:44,829
Wow! This is so cool!

194
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,797
(Laughter)

195
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,384
This is so cool!

196
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,963
How many brain scientists
have the opportunity

197
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,796
to study their own brain
from the inside out?"

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,796
(Laughter)

199
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,796
And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!"

200
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,970
(Laughter)

201
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,161
"I don't have time for a stroke!"

202
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:05,887
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening,

203
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:09,796
so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

204
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,272
So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work."

205
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,196
I couldn't remember the number at work,

206
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,989
so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number.

207
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:22,322
So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards.

208
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,003
And I'm looking at the card on top

209
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:27,361
and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye

210
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,096
what my business card looked like,

211
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,708
I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not,

212
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,598
because all I could see were pixels.

213
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,702
And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background

214
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:41,034
and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell.

215
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:44,198
And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity.

216
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:48,510
And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality

217
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:52,684
and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card.

218
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:58,716
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards.

219
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,614
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,

220
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,296
the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere.

221
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone,

222
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,896
but it's the only plan I have.

223
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,605
So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here.

224
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,011
I take the business card,
I put it right here,

225
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:16,796
and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card

226
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,137
to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad.

227
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,796
But then I would drift back out
into La La Land,

228
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,796
and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers.

229
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,796
So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump

230
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,796
and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them,

231
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,510
so that as I would come back
to normal reality,

232
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:41,542
I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number."

233
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:45,906
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone,

234
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,567
and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me,

235
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,160
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)

236
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:54,619
(Laughter)

237
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,493
And I think to myself,

238
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:59,556
"Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!"

239
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,207
(Laughter)

240
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:04,392
And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him:

241
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,058
"This is Jill! I need help!"

242
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,796
And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo."

243
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,630
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever."

244
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:14,575
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know

245
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:18,225
that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried.

246
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:21,629
So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help.

247
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:25,541
And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance

248
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:29,120
from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

249
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,310
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

250
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:39,699
And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air,

251
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:41,873
just right out of the balloon,

252
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:47,135
I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender.

253
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:53,796
And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life.

254
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,213
And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life,

255
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,899
or this was perhaps
my moment of transition.

256
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,746
When I woke later that afternoon,

257
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,420
I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive.

258
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:18,796
When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life.

259
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,145
And my mind was now suspended

260
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,367
between two very opposite
planes of reality.

261
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,678
Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems

262
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,415
felt like pure pain.

263
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:34,192
Light burned my brain like wildfire,

264
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:37,811
and sounds were so loud and chaotic

265
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,017
that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise,

266
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,009
and I just wanted to escape.

267
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:49,782
Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space,

268
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,623
I felt enormous and expansive,

269
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:57,218
like a genie just liberated
from her bottle.

270
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:01,146
And my spirit soared free,

271
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,820
like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria.

272
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,059
Nirvana.

273
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,503
I found Nirvana.

274
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,201
And I remember thinking,

275
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:20,655
there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself

276
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,193
back inside this tiny little body.

277
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:29,145
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!

278
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:32,272
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.

279
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:36,002
And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive,

280
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:39,978
then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana."

281
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:43,519
And I pictured a world

282
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:49,503
filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people

283
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:53,273
who knew that they could come
to this space at any time.

284
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:57,470
And that they could purposely choose

285
00:15:57,494 --> 00:16:00,287
to step to the right
of their left hemispheres --

286
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,796
and find this peace.

287
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,043
And then I realized

288
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,624
what a tremendous gift
this experience could be,

289
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:14,543
what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives.

290
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,447
And it motivated me to recover.

291
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:25,899
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in,

292
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,471
and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball

293
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,486
that was pushing on my language centers.

294
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,136
Here I am with my mama,

295
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,065
who is a true angel in my life.

296
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:39,239
It took me eight years
to completely recover.

297
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,523
So who are we?

298
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:47,549
We are the life-force power
of the universe,

299
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,870
with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds.

300
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,747
And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment,

301
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,759
who and how we want to be in the world.

302
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,028
Right here, right now,

303
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:06,278
I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are.

304
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,359
I am the life-force power of the universe.

305
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,923
I am the life-force power

306
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,781
of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form,

307
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,081
at one with all that is.

308
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,164
Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere,

309
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:27,469
where I become
a single individual, a solid.

310
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:31,052
Separate from the flow, separate from you.

311
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,186
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

312
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,039
intellectual, neuroanatomist.

313
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,709
These are the "we" inside of me.

314
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:44,804
Which would you choose?

315
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,029
Which do you choose?

316
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:51,957
And when?

317
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,796
I believe that the more time we spend

318
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,797
choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry

319
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,041
of our right hemispheres,

320
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:05,371
the more peace we will project
into the world,

321
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,927
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

322
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:12,085
And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading.

323
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,896
Thank you.

324
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
(Applause)
