1
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:15,876
Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future.

2
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:17,718
It might be between two careers --

3
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,834
artist and accountant --

4
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:22,727
or places to live -- the city or the country --

5
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,670
or even between two people to marry --

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,392
you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita.

7
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:31,107
Or it might be a choice about
whether to have children,

8
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:33,579
to have an ailing parent move in with you,

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,621
to raise your child in a religion

10
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,720
that your partner lives by

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,740
but leaves you cold.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,917
Or whether to donate your life savings to charity.

13
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,380
Chances are, the hard choice you thought of

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,440
was something big, something momentous,

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,307
something that matters to you.

16
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,632
Hard choices seem to be occasions

17
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:53,034
for agonizing, hand-wringing,

18
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,495
the gnashing of teeth.

19
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,704
But I think we've misunderstood hard choices

20
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,954
and the role they play in our lives.

21
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:01,721
Understanding hard choices

22
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,691
uncovers a hidden power

23
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,371
each of us possesses.

24
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,535
What makes a choice hard is the way

25
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,384
the alternatives relate.

26
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,067
In any easy choice,

27
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,636
one alternative is better than the other.

28
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:16,107
In a hard choice,

29
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,204
one alternative is better in some ways,

30
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,000
the other alternative is better in other ways,

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,067
and neither is better than the other overall.

32
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,821
You agonize over whether to stay

33
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,335
in your current job in the city

34
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,725
or uproot your life for

35
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,758
more challenging work in the country

36
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,524
because staying is better in some ways,

37
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:36,910
moving is better in others,

38
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,878
and neither is better than the other overall.

39
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:44,680
We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,093
Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.

41
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:49,690
You could have high fiber bran cereal

42
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,730
or a chocolate donut.

43
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,101
Suppose what matters in the choice

44
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,148
is tastiness and healthfulness.

45
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,444
The cereal is better for you,

46
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,438
the donut tastes way better,

47
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,885
but neither is better than the other overall,

48
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,053
a hard choice.

49
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,099
Realizing that small choices

50
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,192
can also be hard

51
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:13,219
may make big hard choices seem less intractable.

52
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,020
After all, we manage to figure 
out what to have for breakfast,

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,500
so maybe we can figure out

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,119
whether to stay in the city

55
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:23,179
or uproot for the new job in the country.

56
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:27,980
We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,512
because we are stupid.

58
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,306
When I graduated from college,

59
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,177
I couldn't decide between two careers,

60
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:35,747
philosophy and law.

61
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,225
I really loved philosophy.

62
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,854
There are amazing things you can learn

63
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,109
as a philosopher,

64
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:45,397
and all from the comfort of an armchair.

65
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:48,828
But I came from a modest immigrant family

66
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:49,966
where my idea of luxury

67
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:52,810
was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich

68
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,920
in my school lunchbox,

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,159
so the thought of spending my whole life

70
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,549
sitting around in armchairs just thinking,

71
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,697
well, that struck me as the height 
of extravagance and frivolity.

72
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,947
So I got out my yellow pad,

73
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:08,854
I drew a line down the middle,

74
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,847
and I tried my best to think of the reasons

75
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,811
for and against each alternative.

76
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,055
I remember thinking to myself,

77
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:20,142
if only I knew what my life

78
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:21,952
in each career would be like.

79
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,697
If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD

80
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,952
of my two possible future careers, I'd be set.

81
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:31,166
I'd compare them side by side,

82
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,961
I'd see that one was better,

83
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,523
and the choice would be easy.

84
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,546
But I got no DVD,

85
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,223
and because I couldn't figure out which was better,

86
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,040
I did what many of us do in hard choices:

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,918
I took the safest option.

88
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,935
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher

89
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,502
led me to become a lawyer,

90
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,407
and as I discovered,

91
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,096
lawyering didn't quite fit.

92
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,360
It wasn't who I was.

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,165
So now I'm a philosopher,

94
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:00,874
and I study hard choices,

95
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,336
and I can tell you that fear of the unknown,

96
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:07,226
while a common motivational default

97
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:09,710
in dealing with hard choices,

98
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,023
rests on a misconception of them.

99
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,820
It's a mistake to think that in hard choices,

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,045
one alternative really is better than the other,

101
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,873
but we're too stupid to know which,

102
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,580
and since we don't know which, we might as well

103
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,284
take the least risky option.

104
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:27,027
Even taking two alternatives side by side

105
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:31,712
with full information, a choice can still be hard.

106
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,863
Hard choices are hard

107
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,999
not because of us or our ignorance;

108
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:40,322
they're hard because there is no best option.

109
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,476
Now, if there's no best option,

110
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:46,395
if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative

111
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:47,640
over another,

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,617
then surely the alternatives must be equally good.

113
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,471
So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices

114
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,590
is that they're between equally good options.

115
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,775
But that can't be right.

116
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,383
If alternatives are equally good,

117
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,718
you should just flip a coin between them,

118
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,444
and it seems a mistake to think,

119
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,367
here's how you should decide between careers,

120
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:10,327
places to live, people to marry: Flip a coin.

121
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,127
There's another reason for thinking

122
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,427
that hard choices aren't choices

123
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,760
between equally good options.

124
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,040
Suppose you have a choice between two jobs:

125
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,247
you could be an investment banker

126
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,765
or a graphic artist.

127
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:29,711
There are a variety of things
that matter in such a choice,

128
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,910
like the excitement of the work,

129
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,196
achieving financial security,

130
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,570
having time to raise a family, and so on.

131
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,365
Maybe the artist's career puts you

132
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:41,803
on the cutting edge of new forms

133
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,543
of pictorial expression.

134
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,292
Maybe the banking career

135
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,690
puts you on the cutting edge

136
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,057
of new forms of financial manipulation.

137
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:54,136
Imagine the two jobs however you like

138
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,109
so that neither is better than the other.

139
00:05:57,109 --> 00:06:00,201
Now suppose we improve one of them a bit.

140
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,695
Suppose the bank, wooing you,

141
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,084
adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.

142
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:09,856
Does the extra money now make the banking job

143
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:12,448
better than the artist one?

144
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:14,650
Not necessarily.

145
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,818
A higher salary makes the banking job

146
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,783
better than it was before,

147
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:20,960
but it might not be enough to make

148
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,931
being a banker better than being an artist.

149
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,585
But if an improvement in one of the jobs

150
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:29,394
doesn't make it better than the other,

151
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:30,566
then the two original jobs

152
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:33,365
could not have been equally good.

153
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,347
If you start with two things that are equally good,

154
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,205
and you improve one of them,

155
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:40,100
it now must be better than the other.

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,722
That's not the case with options in hard choices.

157
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,440
So now we've got a puzzle.

158
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,116
We've got two jobs.

159
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,076
Neither is better than the other,

160
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,098
nor are they equally good.

161
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,404
So how are we supposed to choose?

162
00:06:55,404 --> 00:07:00,039
Something seems to have gone wrong here.

163
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,510
Maybe the choice itself is problematic

164
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,780
and comparison is impossible.

165
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,340
But that can't be right.

166
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,148
It's not like we're trying to choose between

167
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,527
two things that can't be compared.

168
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:14,658
We're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all,

169
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,438
not the merits of the number nine

170
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:19,619
and a plate of fried eggs.

171
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,910
A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs

172
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,914
is something we can make,

173
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:28,876
and one we often do make.

174
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,081
I think the puzzle arises

175
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,400
because of an unreflective assumption

176
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,720
we make about value.

177
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,776
We unwittingly assume that values

178
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,331
like justice, beauty, kindness,

179
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:44,445
are akin to scientific quantities,

180
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:48,825
like length, mass and weight.

181
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,745
Take any comparative question not involving value,

182
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:55,409
such as which of two suitcases is heavier.

183
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,094
There are only three possibilities.

184
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:01,218
The weight of one is greater, lesser

185
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:04,114
or equal to the weight of the other.

186
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,406
Properties like weight can be represented

187
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,281
by real numbers -- one, two, three and so on --

188
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,348
and there are only three possible comparisons

189
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:14,891
between any two real numbers.

190
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:17,284
One number is greater, lesser,

191
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:20,019
or equal to the other.

192
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,806
Not so with values.

193
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,111
As post-Enlightenment creatures,

194
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,954
we tend to assume

195
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,408
that scientific thinking holds the key

196
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,660
to everything of importance in our world,

197
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,117
but the world of value

198
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,194
is different from the world of science.

199
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:37,908
The stuff of the one world

200
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,760
can be quantified by real numbers.

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,193
The stuff of the other world can't.

202
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,644
We shouldn't assume

203
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,277
that the world of is, of lengths and weights,

204
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,305
has the same structure as the world of ought,

205
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,356
of what we should do.

206
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,670
So if what matters to us --

207
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,078
a child's delight, the love
you have for your partner —

208
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,819
can't be represented by real numbers,

209
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,824
then there's no reason to believe

210
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:06,322
that in choice, there are only three possibilities --

211
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:09,947
that one alternative is better, worse or equal

212
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,927
to the other.

213
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:16,000
We need to introduce a new, fourth relation

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,651
beyond being better, worse or equal,

215
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:23,364
that describes what's going on in hard choices.

216
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:25,522
I like to say that the alternatives are

217
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,971
"on a par."

218
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,571
When alternatives are on a par,

219
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:31,746
it may matter very much which you choose,

220
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:35,039
but one alternative isn't better than the other.

221
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,201
Rather, the alternatives are in

222
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,479
the same neighborhood of value,

223
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,478
in the same league of value,

224
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:44,003
while at the same time being very different

225
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:45,781
in kind of value.

226
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:49,259
That's why the choice is hard.

227
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,621
Understanding hard choices in this way

228
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,671
uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know.

229
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,025
Each of us has the power

230
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,563
to create reasons.

231
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:04,770
Imagine a world in which every choice you face

232
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,460
is an easy choice,

233
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,852
that is, there's always a best alternative.

234
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,600
If there's a best alternative,

235
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,042
then that's the one you should choose,

236
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,052
because part of being rational

237
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,642
is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing,

238
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:19,858
choosing what you have most reason to choose.

239
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,920
In such a world,

240
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,286
we'd have most reason

241
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,766
to wear black socks instead of pink socks,

242
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,681
to eat cereal instead of donuts,

243
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,286
to live in the city rather than the country,

244
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,488
to marry Betty instead of Lolita.

245
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,606
A world full of only easy choices

246
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:39,500
would enslave us to reasons.

247
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,067
When you think about it,

248
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,667
it's nuts to believe

249
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,764
that the reasons given to you

250
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:52,753
dictated that you had most reason to pursue

251
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,511
the exact hobbies you do,

252
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,790
to live in the exact house you do,

253
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,026
to work at the exact job you do.

254
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,554
Instead, you faced alternatives

255
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:06,969
that were on a par — hard choices —

256
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,740
and you made reasons for yourself

257
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,362
to choose that hobby, that house and that job.

258
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:16,903
When alternatives are on a par,

259
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:18,633
the reasons given to us, the ones

260
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,401
that determine whether we're making a mistake,

261
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:24,461
are silent as to what to do.

262
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:27,824
It's here, in the space of hard choices,

263
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:30,305
that we get to exercise

264
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:32,984
our normative power,

265
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,435
the power to create reasons for yourself,

266
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,204
to make yourself

267
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:39,850
into the kind of person

268
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,083
for whom country living

269
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,816
is preferable to the urban life.

270
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,554
When we choose between

271
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,253
options that are on a par,

272
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:52,026
we can do something really rather remarkable.

273
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:55,749
We can put our very selves behind an option.

274
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,566
Here's where I stand.

275
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,952
Here's who I am. I am for banking.

276
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:05,588
I am for chocolate donuts.

277
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,131
This response in hard choices

278
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:10,219
is a rational response,

279
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:13,137
but it's not dictated by reasons given to us.

280
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:19,585
Rather, it's supported by reasons created by us.

281
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,990
When we create reasons for ourselves

282
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,304
to become this kind of person rather than that,

283
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:29,037
we wholeheartedly become the people that we are.

284
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,493
You might say that we become the authors

285
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:34,579
of our own lives.

286
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,031
So when we face hard choices,

287
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,253
we shouldn't beat our head against a wall

288
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,750
trying to figure out which alternative is better.

289
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,189
There is no best alternative.

290
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,708
Instead of looking for reasons out there,

291
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,294
we should be looking for reasons in here:

292
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:51,973
Who am I to be?

293
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:55,129
You might decide to be a pink sock-wearing,

294
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,817
cereal-loving, country-living banker,

295
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:02,393
and I might decide to be a black sock-wearing,

296
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:05,850
urban, donut-loving artist.

297
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,657
What we do in hard choices is very much

298
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:12,640
up to each of us.

299
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,291
Now, people who don't exercise their
normative powers in hard choices

300
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,906
are drifters.

301
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:20,988
We all know people like that.

302
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,138
I drifted into being a lawyer.

303
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,229
I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.

304
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,909
I wasn't for lawyering.

305
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:30,840
Drifters allow the world

306
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,064
to write the story of their lives.

307
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:36,967
They let mechanisms of reward and punishment --

308
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:40,807
pats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option —

309
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,478
to determine what they do.

310
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,954
So the lesson of hard choices:

311
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:50,429
reflect on what you can put your agency behind,

312
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,819
on what you can be for,

313
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,589
and through hard choices,

314
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,366
become that person.

315
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,544
Far from being sources of agony and dread,

316
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:05,114
hard choices are precious opportunities

317
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,045
for us to celebrate what is special

318
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,878
about the human condition,

319
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:11,508
that the reasons that govern our choices

320
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,491
as correct or incorrect

321
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,153
sometimes run out,

322
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,376
and it is here, in the space of hard choices,

323
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,065
that we have the power

324
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,577
to create reasons for ourselves

325
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:26,155
to become the distinctive people that we are.

326
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,775
And that's why hard choices are not a curse

327
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,425
but a godsend.

328
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:33,096
Thank you.

329
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:36,391
(Applause)
