1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Just a few minutes ago, I took this picture

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
about 10 blocks from here.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I took this picture because this turns out to be

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
the first coffeehouse to open

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
in England in 1650.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
That's its great claim to fame,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
and I wanted to show it to you,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
of historic England,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
but rather because

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
the English coffeehouse was crucial

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
to the development and spread

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
what we now call the Enlightenment.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
And the coffeehouse played such a big role

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
in the birth of the Enlightenment,

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
in part, because of what people were drinking there.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Because, before the spread

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
of coffee and tea through British culture,

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
day-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
was alcohol.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
a little gin -- particularly around 1650 --

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
That was the healthy choice -- right --

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
because the water wasn't safe to drink.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
And so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
you had an entire population

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
that was effectively drunk all day.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
And you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life --

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and I know this is true of some of you --

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
if you were drinking all day,

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
you would have better ideas.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
You would be sharper and more alert.

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
as England switched to tea and coffee.

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
is the architecture of the space.

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
It was a space where people would get together

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
from different backgrounds,

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
different fields of expertise, and share.

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense --

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
ideas would get together there.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
for the last five years,

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
because I've been kind of on this quest

54
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
to investigate this question

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
of where good ideas come from.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
What are the environments

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
that lead to unusual levels of innovation,

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
unusual levels of creativity?

59
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
What's the kind of environmental --

60
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
what is the space of creativity?

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
And what I've done is

62
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;

63
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,

64
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I've gone back to the history of the first cities;

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
I've even gone to biological environments,

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
like coral reefs and rainforests,

68
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
that involve unusual levels of biological innovation;

69
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
and what I've been looking for is shared patterns,

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
kind of signature behavior that shows up

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
again and again in all of these environments.

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from,

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,

74
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
or our own organizations,

75
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?

76
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
And I think I've found a few.

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
But what you have to do to make sense of this

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and to really understand these principles

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
is you have to do away

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language

81
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
steers us towards

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
certain concepts of idea-creation.

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
We have this very rich vocabulary

84
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
to describe moments of inspiration.

85
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
We have the kind of the flash of insight,

86
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
the stroke of insight,

87
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
we have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
we have the lightbulb moments, right?

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
All of these concepts,

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
as kind of rhetorically florid as they are,

91
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
share this basic assumption,

92
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
which is that an idea is a single thing,

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
it's something that happens often

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
in a wonderful illuminating moment.

95
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
But in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with

96
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
is this idea that an idea is a network

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
on the most elemental level.

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.

99
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
An idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
firing in sync with each other inside your brain.

101
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
It's a new configuration that has never formed before.

102
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And the question is: how do you get your brain into environments

103
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?

104
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world

105
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
mimic a lot of the network patterns

106
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
of the internal world of the human brain.

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
So the metaphor I'd like the use

108
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
I can take

109
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
from a story of a great idea that's quite recent --

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
of, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates

115
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
in the developing world.

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
by getting modern neonatal incubators

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
into any context,

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple --

120
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
So, the technology is there.

122
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.

123
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,

124
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
and you send it off

125
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
to a mid-sized village in Africa,

126
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
it will work great for a year or two years,

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and then something will go wrong and it will break,

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
and it will remain broken forever,

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
because you don't have a whole system of spare parts,

130
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise

131
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

132
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money

133
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,

134
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
and then it ends up being useless.

135
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
So what Prestero and his team decided to do

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
is to look around and see: what are the abundant resources

137
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
in these developing world contexts?

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs,

139
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
they don't have a lot of microwaves,

140
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.

141
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
There's a Toyota Forerunner

142
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
on the street in all these places.

143
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.

144
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
So they started to think,

145
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

146
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
that's built entirely out of automobile parts?"

147
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And this is what they ended up coming with.

148
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
It's called a "neonurture device."

149
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
From the outside, it looks like a normal little thing

150
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
you'd find in a modern, Western hospital.

151
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
In the inside, it's all car parts.

152
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,

153
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
it's got door chimes for alarm --

154
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
it runs off a car battery.

155
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota

156
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
and the ability to fix a headlight,

157
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
and you can repair this thing.

158
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Now, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact,

159
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.

160
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,

161
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
are like that $40,000, brand new incubator,

162
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
state-of-the-art technology,

163
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
but more often than not, they're cobbled together

164
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.

165
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We take ideas from other people,

166
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
from people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,

167
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.

168
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
That's really where innovation happens.

169
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And that means that we have to change some of our models

170
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.

171
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
I mean, this is one vision of it.

172
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.

173
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
This is a statue from Oxford.

174
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,

175
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.

176
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
In fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation

177
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
tend to look like this, right.

178
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

179
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.

180
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
This is the kind of chaotic environment

181
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
where ideas were likely to come together,

182
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
where people were likely to have

183
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
new, interesting, unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds.

184
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
So, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,

185
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this.

186
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
This is what your office should look like,

187
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
is part of my message here.

188
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
And one of the problems with this is that

189
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,820
people are actually -- when you research this field --

190
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
people are notoriously unreliable,

191
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
when they actually kind of self-report

192
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
on where they have their own good ideas,

193
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
or their history of their best ideas.

194
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
And a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar

195
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
decided to go around

196
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
and basically do the Big Brother approach

197
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
to figuring out where good ideas come from.

198
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
He went to a bunch of science labs around the world

199
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
and videotaped everyone

200
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
as they were doing every little bit of their job.

201
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope,

202
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.

203
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
And he recorded all of these conversations

204
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
and tried to figure out where the most important ideas,

205
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
where they happened.

206
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,

207
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope,

208
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
and they see something in the tissue sample.

209
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
And "oh, eureka," they've got the idea.

210
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape

211
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas

212
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.

213
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
They happened at the conference table

214
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
at the weekly lab meeting,

215
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,

216
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,

217
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
the error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.

218
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
And something about that environment --

219
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
and I've started calling it the "liquid network,"

220
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
where you have lots of different ideas that are together,

221
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
different backgrounds, different interests,

222
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
jostling with each other, bouncing off each other --

223
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
that environment is, in fact,

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
the environment that leads to innovation.

225
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
The other problem that people have

226
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
is they like to condense their stories of innovation down

227
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
to kind of shorter time frames.

228
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
So they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.

229
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there

230
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and I had it all suddenly clear in my head."

231
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
But in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,

232
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
it turns out that a lot of important ideas

233
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
have very long incubation periods --

234
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I call this the "slow hunch."

235
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
We've heard a lot recently

236
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
about hunch and instinct

237
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
but in fact, a lot of great ideas

239
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
linger on, sometimes for decades,

240
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
in the back of people's minds.

241
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,

242
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.

243
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
They spend all this time working on certain problems,

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
but there's another thing lingering there

245
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
that they're interested in, but they can't quite solve.

246
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Darwin is a great example of this.

247
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,

248
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
tells the story of coming up with the idea

249
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
for natural selection

250
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
as a classic "eureka!" moment.

251
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
He's in his study,

252
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
it's October of 1838,

253
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.

254
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
And all of a sudden,

255
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head

256
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."

257
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
That's in his autobiography.

258
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
About a decade or two ago,

259
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back

260
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.

261
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
And Darwin kept these copious notebooks

262
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.

263
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
And what Gruber found was

264
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection

265
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
for months and months and months

266
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
before he had his alleged epiphany,

267
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
reading Malthus in October of 1838.

268
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
There are passages where you can read it,

269
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,

270
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
from the period before he has this epiphany.

271
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,

272
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
had the idea, he had the concept,

273
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
but was unable of fully thinking it yet.

274
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And that is actually how great ideas often happen;

275
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
they fade into view over long periods of time.

276
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Now the challenge for all of us is:

277
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
how do you create environments

278
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?

279
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

280
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
"I have an excellent idea for our organization.

281
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
It will be useful in 2020.

282
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Could you just give me some time to do that?"

283
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Now a couple of companies -- like Google --

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
they have innovation time off, 20 percent time,

285
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
where, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.

286
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
But that's a key thing.

287
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
And the other thing is to allow those hunches

288
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.

289
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,

290
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
and if you're in the right environment,

291
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.

292
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
So, in a sense,

293
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
we often talk about the value

294
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
of protecting intellectual property,

295
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
you know, building barricades,

296
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
having secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have,

297
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

298
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,

299
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
and the culture will be more innovative.

300
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
But I think there's a case to be made

301
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
that we should spend at least as much time, if not more,

302
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

303
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
and not just protecting them.

304
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
And I'll leave you with this story,

305
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
which I think captures a lot of these values,

306
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation

307
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
and how it happens in unlikely ways.

308
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
It's October of 1957,

309
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
and Sputnik has just launched,

310
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
and we're in Laurel Maryland,

311
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
at the applied physics lab

312
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
associated with Johns Hopkins University.

313
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
And it's Monday morning,

314
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
and the news has just broken about this satellite

315
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
that's now orbiting the planet.

316
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
And of course, this is nerd heaven, right?

317
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,

318
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened."

319
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
And two of them,

320
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
two 20-something researchers at the APL

321
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
are there at the cafeteria table

322
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.

323
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

324
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
And they start talking, and one of them says,

325
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?

326
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space

327
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.

328
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

329
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,

330
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

331
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
That's an interesting idea."

332
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert

333
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
in microwave reception,

334
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
and he's got a little antennae set up

335
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
with an amplifier in his office.

336
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,

337
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.

338
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,

339
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
because the Soviets made Sputnik

340
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
very easy to track.

341
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,

342
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
So they made it really easy to find it.

344
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,

345
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
and people start kind of coming into the office and saying,

346
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
"Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great."

347
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
And before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.

348
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.

349
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
We should record it."

350
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder

351
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
and they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.

352
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
And they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps

353
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
for each little bleep that they record.

354
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
And they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing

355
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
small little frequency variations here.

356
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
We could probably calculate the speed

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
that the satellite is traveling,

358
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
if we do a little basic math here

359
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
using the Doppler effect."

360
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
And then they played around with it a little bit more,

361
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
and they talked to a couple of their colleagues

362
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
who had other kind of specialties.

363
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
And they said, "Jeez, you know,

364
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect

365
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
to figure out the points at which

366
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
the satellite is closest to our antennae

367
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
and the points at which it's farthest away.

368
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
That's pretty cool."

369
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
And eventually, they get permission --

370
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.

371
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer

372
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.

373
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
They run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,

374
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory

375
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
of this satellite around the Earth,

376
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
just from listening to this one little signal,

377
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do

378
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
over lunch one morning.

379
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
A couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,

380
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
pulls them into the room and says,

381
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something

382
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
about that project you were working on.

383
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
You've figured out an unknown location

384
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
of a satellite orbiting the planet

385
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
from a known location on the ground.

386
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Could you go the other way?

387
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground,

388
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
if you knew the location of the satellite?"

389
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
And they thought about it and they said,

390
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here."

391
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
So they went back, and they thought about it.

392
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
And they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."

393
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
And he said, "Oh, that's great.

394
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Because see, I have these new nuclear submarines

395
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
that I'm building.

396
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile

397
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
so that it will land right on top of Moscow,

398
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

399
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
So we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites

400
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and use it to track our submarines

401
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.

402
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Could you work on that problem?"

403
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
And that's how GPS was born.

404
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
30 years later,

405
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform

406
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
that anybody could kind of build upon

407
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
and anybody could come along and build new technology

408
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
that would create and innovate

409
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
on top of this open platform,

410
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
left it open for anyone to do

411
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
pretty much anything they wanted with it.

412
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
And now, I guarantee you

413
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
certainly half of this room, if not more,

414
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
has a device sitting in their pocket right now

415
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space.

416
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
And I bet you one of you, if not more,

417
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
has used said device and said satellite system

418
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --

419
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
(Laughter)

420
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
in the last day or last week, right?

421
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
(Applause)

422
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
And that, I think,

423
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
is a great case study, a great lesson

424
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
in the power, the marvelous, kind of unplanned

425
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
emergent, unpredictable power

426
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
of open innovative systems.

427
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
When you build them right, they will be led to completely new directions

428
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
that the creators never even dreamed of.

429
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
I mean, here you have these guys

430
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
who basically thought they were just following this hunch,

431
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
this little passion that had developed,

432
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
then they thought they were fighting the Cold War,

433
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
and then it turns out they're just helping somebody

434
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
find a soy latte.

435
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
(Laughter)

436
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
That is how innovation happens.

437
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Chance favors the connected mind.

438
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Thank you very much.

439
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
(Applause)
