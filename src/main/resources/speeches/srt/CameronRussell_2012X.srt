1
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:14,746
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,

2
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,799
and for the last little while,
I've been a model.

3
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:23,164
Actually, for 10 years.

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,966
And I feel like

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,790
there's an uncomfortable tension
in the room right now

6
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,837
because I should not have worn this dress.

7
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,619
(Laughter)

8
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:36,117
So luckily, I brought an outfit change.

9
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:39,766
This is the first outfit change
on the TED stage,

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,812
so you guys are pretty lucky
to witness it, I think.

11
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,753
If some of the women were
really horrified when I came out,

12
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:48,920
you don't have to tell me now,
but I'll find out later on Twitter.

13
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:52,164
(Laughter)

14
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,993
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged

15
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:59,071
to be able to transform
what you think of me

16
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,734
in a very brief 10 seconds.

17
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,503
Not everybody gets to do that.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,054
These heels are very uncomfortable,
so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.

19
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,580
The worst part is putting
this sweater over my head,

20
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,653
because that's when
you'll all laugh at me,

21
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,785
so don't do anything
while it's over my head.

22
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,582
All right.

23
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:25,510
So, why did I do that?

24
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,740
That was awkward.

25
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:28,692
(Laughter)

26
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:29,827
Well --

27
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,217
(Laughter)

28
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:35,932
Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.

29
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:39,884
Image is powerful,

30
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:43,309
but also, image is superficial.

31
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:49,275
I just totally transformed
what you thought of me, in six seconds.

32
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,114
And in this picture,

33
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:53,685
I had actually never had
a boyfriend in real life.

34
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:56,256
I was totally uncomfortable,

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,758
and the photographer
was telling me to arch my back

36
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,477
and put my hand in that guy's hair.

37
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,809
And of course, barring surgery,

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,250
or the fake tan that I got
two days ago for work,

39
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:12,011
there's very little that we can do
to transform how we look,

40
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:15,467
and how we look, though it is
superficial and immutable,

41
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:17,801
has a huge impact on our lives.

42
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:24,458
So today, for me, being
fearless means being honest.

43
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:27,343
And I am on this stage
because I am a model.

44
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:31,070
I am on this stage because
I am a pretty, white woman,

45
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:33,835
and in my industry,
we call that a sexy girl.

46
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:36,706
I'm going to answer the questions
that people always ask me,

47
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,028
but with an honest twist.

48
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:40,930
So the first question is,
how do you become a model?

49
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,963
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"

50
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:44,145
but that means nothing.

51
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,250
The real way that I became a model

52
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,737
is I won a genetic lottery,
and I am the recipient of a legacy,

53
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,857
and maybe you're wondering
what is a legacy.

54
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,603
Well, for the past few centuries

55
00:02:55,627 --> 00:03:01,121
we have defined beauty
not just as health and youth

56
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:04,907
and symmetry that we're biologically
programmed to admire,

57
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,443
but also as tall, slender figures,

58
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:11,690
and femininity and white skin.

59
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:13,762
And this is a legacy
that was built for me,

60
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:16,236
and it's a legacy
that I've been cashing out on.

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,290
And I know there are
people in the audience

62
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,006
who are skeptical at this point,

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,507
and maybe there are
some fashionistas who are like,

64
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,050
"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."

65
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:28,217
And first, I commend you on your model
knowledge. Very impressive.

66
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,873
(Laughter)

67
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:33,426
But unfortunately,
I have to inform you that in 2007,

68
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,936
a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,562
counted all the models on the runway,
every single one that was hired,

70
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,690
and of the 677 models that were hired,

71
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:46,207
only 27, or less than four percent,
were non-white.

72
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:49,390
The next question people always ask is,

73
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,039
"Can I be a model when I grow up?"

74
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,697
And the first answer is, "I don't know,
they don't put me in charge of that."

75
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,114
But the second answer,

76
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,892
and what I really want to say
to these little girls is,

77
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,906
"Why? You know? You can be anything.

78
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,176
You could be the President
of the United States,

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,977
or the inventor of the next Internet,

80
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,959
or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,

81
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,650
which would be awesome,
because you'd be the first one."

82
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,836
(Laughter)

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,194
If, after this amazing list,
they still are like,

84
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,123
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"

85
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,761
well, then I say, "Be my boss."

86
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,651
Because I'm not in charge of anything,

87
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,202
and you could be the editor in chief
of American Vogue

88
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,362
or the CEO of H&M,
or the next Steven Meisel.

89
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,232
Saying that you want to be
a model when you grow up

90
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,590
is akin to saying that you want to win
the Powerball when you grow up.

91
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:34,034
It's out of your control,
and it's awesome,

92
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:35,460
and it's not a career path.

93
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:40,103
I will demonstrate for you now
10 years of accumulated model knowledge,

94
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,032
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,

95
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,758
it can just be distilled right now.

96
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:47,842
So, if the photographer is right there,

97
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,923
the light is right there, like a nice HMI,

98
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,094
and the client says,
"We want a walking shot,"

99
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:55,802
this leg goes first, nice and long,
this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,

100
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:58,744
the head is at three quarters,
and you just go back and forth,

101
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,768
just do that, and then you look back
at your imaginary friends,

102
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,511
300, 400, 500 times.

103
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,215
(Laughter)

104
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,026
It will look something like this.

105
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,237
(Laughter)

106
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,189
Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.

107
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,764
That was -- I don't know
what happened there.

108
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,895
Unfortunately,
after you've gone to school,

109
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,249
and you have a résumé
and you've done a few jobs,

110
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,765
you can't say anything anymore,

111
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,836
so if you say you want to be
the President of the United States,

112
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,266
but your résumé reads,
"Underwear Model: 10 years,"

113
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,696
people give you a funny look.

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,308
The next question is,
"Do they retouch all the photos?"

115
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:32,713
And yeah, they pretty much
retouch all the photos,

116
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:35,346
but that is only a small component
of what's happening.

117
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:38,544
This picture is the very first
picture that I ever took,

118
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:41,377
and it's also the very first time
that I had worn a bikini,

119
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,181
and I didn't even have my period yet.

120
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,332
I know we're getting personal,
but I was a young girl.

121
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:49,606
This is what I looked like with my grandma
just a few months earlier.

122
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,012
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.

123
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,380
My friend got to come.

124
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,652
Here's me at a slumber party
a few days before I shot French Vogue.

125
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,113
Here's me on the soccer team
and in V Magazine.

126
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,043
And here's me today.

127
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,103
And I hope what you're seeing

128
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,301
is that these pictures
are not pictures of me.

129
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,739
They are constructions,

130
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:12,667
and they are constructions
by a group of professionals,

131
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:15,787
by hairstylists and makeup artists
and photographers and stylists

132
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:19,003
and all of their assistants
and pre-production and post-production,

133
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,035
and they build this.

134
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:21,129
That's not me.

135
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,550
Okay, so the next question
people always ask me is,

136
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:24,900
"Do you get free stuff?"

137
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:25,970
(Laughter)

138
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,241
I do have too many 8-inch heels
which I never get to wear,

139
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,860
except for earlier,

140
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,345
but the free stuff that I get
is the free stuff that I get in real life,

141
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,599
and that's what we don't like
to talk about.

142
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:37,890
I grew up in Cambridge,

143
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,486
and one time I went into a store
and I forgot my money

144
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,618
and they gave me the dress for free.

145
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,138
When I was a teenager,
I was driving with my friend

146
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:47,829
who was an awful driver
and she ran a red and of course,

147
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,042
we got pulled over,

148
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,873
and all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"
and we were on our way.

149
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:57,365
And I got these free things
because of how I look,

150
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,184
not who I am, and there are
people paying a cost

151
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,426
for how they look and not who they are.

152
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,070
I live in New York, and last year,

153
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:07,873
of the 140,000 teenagers
that were stopped and frisked,

154
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,912
86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.

155
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:16,398
And there are only 177,000
young black and Latino men in New York,

156
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:19,137
so for them, it's not a question
of, "Will I get stopped?"

157
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,219
but "How many times will I get stopped?
When will I get stopped?"

158
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,815
When I was researching this talk,

159
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,994
I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
in the United States,

160
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,681
53% don't like their bodies,

161
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,674
and that number goes to 78%
by the time that they're 17.

162
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,699
So, the last question people ask me is,

163
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,323
"What is it like to be a model?"

164
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,730
And I think the answer
that they're looking for is,

165
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,674
"If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,

166
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,471
you will be so happy and fabulous."

167
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,030
And when we're backstage,

168
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,577
we give an answer
that maybe makes it seem like that.

169
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,081
We say, "It's really amazing to travel,
and it's amazing to get to work

170
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,705
with creative, inspired,
passionate people."

171
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,872
And those things are true,
but they're only one half of the story,

172
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,474
because the thing
that we never say on camera,

173
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,570
that I have never said on camera, is,

174
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:05,966
"I am insecure."

175
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:11,126
And I'm insecure because I have to think
about what I look like every day.

176
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,392
And if you ever are wondering,

177
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,346
"If I have thinner thighs
and shinier hair, will I be happier?"

178
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,275
you just need to meet a group of models,

179
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,225
because they have the thinnest thighs,
the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,

180
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,692
and they're the most physically
insecure women probably on the planet.

181
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,098
When I was writing this talk,

182
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:33,091
I found it very difficult
to strike an honest balance,

183
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,549
because on the one hand,

184
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,985
I felt very uncomfortable
to come out here and say,

185
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,604
"Look I've received all these benefits
from a deck stacked in my favor,"

186
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:43,819
and it also felt really uncomfortable
to follow that up with,

187
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:46,207
"and it doesn't always make me happy."

188
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:52,106
But mostly it was difficult to unpack
a legacy of gender and racial oppression

189
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,238
when I am one
of the biggest beneficiaries.

190
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,099
But I'm also happy
and honored to be up here

191
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,335
and I think that it's great
that I got to come

192
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:05,032
before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
and I'd had more agency in my career,

193
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,530
because maybe then I wouldn't tell
the story of how I got my first job,

194
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,427
or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
of how I paid for college,

195
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,124
which seems so important right now.

196
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,792
If there's a takeaway to this talk,

197
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:19,419
I hope it's that we all feel
more comfortable acknowledging

198
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:23,386
the power of image
in our perceived successes

199
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,286
and our perceived failures.

200
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,662
Thank you.

201
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,790
