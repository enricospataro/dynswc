1
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,865
I've been thinking a lot about the world recently

2
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:19,552
and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.

3
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,971
Twenty or 30 years ago,

4
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,501
if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died

5
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,470
in a remote village in East Asia,

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,840
it would have been a tragedy for the chicken

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,037
and its closest relatives,

8
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:32,245
but I don't think there was much possibility

9
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,920
of us fearing a global pandemic

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,913
and the deaths of millions.

11
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,641
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,786
lent too much money to some people

13
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:43,807
who couldn't afford to pay it back

14
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,539
and the bank went bust,

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,556
that was bad for the lender

16
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,188
and bad for the borrower,

17
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,051
but we didn't imagine it would bring

18
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,266
the global economic system to its knees

19
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,068
for nearly a decade.

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,654
This is globalization.

21
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:59,140
This is the miracle that has enabled us

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,234
to transship our bodies and our minds

23
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,596
and our words and our pictures and our ideas

24
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,781
and our teaching and our learning around the planet

25
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:10,789
ever faster and ever cheaper.

26
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,277
It's brought a lot of bad stuff,

27
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:13,921
like the stuff that I just described,

28
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,523
but it's also brought a lot of good stuff.

29
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,113
A lot of us are not aware

30
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:22,090
of the extraordinary successes of
the Millennium Development Goals,

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,820
several of which have achieved their targets

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,507
long before the due date.

33
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,522
That proves that this species of humanity

34
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,526
is capable of achieving extraordinary progress

35
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:35,976
if it really acts together and it really tries hard.

36
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:38,293
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,

37
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:41,191
I sort of feel that globalization

38
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,034
has taken us by surprise,

39
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,814
and we've been slow to respond to it.

40
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,045
If you look at the downside of globalization,

41
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:50,997
it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.

42
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:53,106
All of the grand challenges that we face today,

43
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:56,263
like climate change and human rights

44
00:01:56,263 --> 00:02:00,561
and demographics and terrorism and pandemics

45
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:03,204
and narco-trafficking and human slavery

46
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,924
and species loss, I could go on,

47
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,880
we're not making an awful lot of progress

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,262
against an awful lot of those challenges.

49
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:12,125
So in a nutshell, that's the challenge

50
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,564
that we all face today

51
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:16,062
at this interesting point in history.

52
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:17,964
That's clearly what we've got to do next.

53
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:21,010
We've somehow got to get our act together

54
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,888
and we've got to figure out how to globalize

55
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:24,823
the solutions better

56
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,367
so that we don't simply become a species

57
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:32,283
which is the victim of the globalization of problems.

58
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:35,930
Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,087
What's the reason for it?

60
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,031
Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,

61
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,542
but perhaps the primary reason

62
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,996
is because we're still organized as a species

63
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:47,598
in the same way that we were organized

64
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,270
200 or 300 years ago.

65
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,958
There's one superpower left on the planet

66
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,030
and that is the seven billion people,

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,420
the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,303
the same seven billion, by the way,

69
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,143
who will resolve them all.

70
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,582
But how are those seven billion organized?

71
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,272
They're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,

72
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,769
and the nations have governments

73
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,584
that make rules

74
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,516
and cause us to behave in certain ways.

75
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,406
And that's a pretty efficient system,

76
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,387
but the problem is that the
way that those laws are made

77
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,952
and the way those governments think

78
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:23,438
is absolutely wrong for the
solution of global problems,

79
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,049
because it all looks inwards.

80
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:27,638
The politicians that we elect

81
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:30,030
and the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,

82
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,529
have minds that microscope.

83
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:34,229
They don't have minds that telescope.

84
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,696
They look in. They pretend, they behave,

85
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:42,090
as if they believed that every country was an island

86
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,071
that existed quite happily, independently

87
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,546
of all the others

88
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,363
on its own little planet

89
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,315
in its own little solar system.

90
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:51,118
This is the problem:

91
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,236
countries competing against each other,

92
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,038
countries fighting against each other.

93
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:56,769
This week, as any week you care to look at,

94
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,202
you'll find people actually trying to kill
each other from country to country,

95
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,023
but even when that's not going on,

96
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,958
there's competition between countries,

97
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,570
each one trying to shaft the next.

98
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,649
This is clearly not a good arrangement.

99
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,610
We clearly need to change it.

100
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,588
We clearly need to find ways

101
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:15,233
of encouraging countries to start working together

102
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,844
a little bit better.

103
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,114
And why won't they do that?

104
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:23,242
Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?

105
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,958
Well, the first and most obvious reason

106
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,871
is because that's what we ask them to do.

107
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:28,555
That's what we tell them to do.

108
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:29,975
When we elect governments

109
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,506
or when we tolerate unelected governments,

110
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,982
we're effectively telling them that what we want

111
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,665
is for them to deliver us in our country

112
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,398
a certain number of things.

113
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:42,353
We want them to deliver prosperity,

114
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:47,119
growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice

115
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,794
and all of those things.

116
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:51,064
So unless we start asking our governments

117
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:53,345
to think outside a little bit,

118
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,797
to consider the global problems that will finish us all

119
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,756
if we don't start considering them,

120
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,074
then we can hardly blame them

121
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,789
if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,

122
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,601
if they still have minds that microscope

123
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,527
rather than minds that telescope.

124
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:09,465
That's the first reason why
things tend not to change.

125
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:12,719
The second reason is that these governments,

126
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,545
just like all the rest of us,

127
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,170
are cultural psychopaths.

128
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,477
I don't mean to be rude,

129
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,884
but you know what a psychopath is.

130
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,612
A psychopath is a person who,

131
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,149
unfortunately for him or her,

132
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,188
lacks the ability to really empathize

133
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,001
with other human beings.

134
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,140
When they look around,

135
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,802
they don't see other human beings

136
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,916
with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives

137
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,044
and aims and ambitions.

138
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:37,041
What they see is cardboard cutouts,

139
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,614
and it's very sad and it's very lonely,

140
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:42,352
and it's very rare, fortunately.

141
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,507
But actually, aren't most of us

142
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:47,746
not really so very good at empathy?

143
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:48,967
Oh sure, we're very good at empathy

144
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,720
when it's a question of dealing with people

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,147
who kind of look like us

146
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,629
and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray

147
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,311
and wear like us,

148
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:58,332
but when it comes to people who don't do that,

149
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,749
who don't quite dress like us

150
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,596
and don't quite pray like us

151
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,001
and don't quite talk like us,

152
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,880
do we not also have a tendency to see them

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,306
ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?

154
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,014
And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.

155
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,500
I think constantly we have to monitor it.

156
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,594
Are we and our politicians to a degree

157
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:18,980
cultural psychopaths?

158
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,628
The third reason is hardly worth mentioning

159
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,079
because it's so silly,

160
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,019
but there's a belief amongst governments

161
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,533
that the domestic agenda

162
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,040
and the international agenda

163
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,740
are incompatible and always will be.

164
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,650
This is just nonsense.

165
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,128
In my day job, I'm a policy adviser.

166
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,587
I've spent the last 15 years or so

167
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,397
advising governments around the world,

168
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,451
and in all of that time I have never once seen

169
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,815
a single domestic policy issue

170
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,564
that could not be more imaginatively,

171
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,948
effectively and rapidly resolved

172
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:50,552
than by treating it as an international problem,

173
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,343
looking at the international context,

174
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,138
comparing what others have done,

175
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:57,097
bringing in others, working externally

176
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:00,464
instead of working internally.

177
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,686
And so you may say, well, given all of that,

178
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,355
why then doesn't it work?

179
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,736
Why can we not make our politicians change?

180
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,058
Why can't we demand them?

181
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,936
Well I, like a lot of us, spend
a lot of time complaining

182
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:15,289
about how hard it is to make people change,

183
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,068
and I don't think we should fuss about it.

184
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,664
I think we should just accept

185
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,435
that we are an inherently conservative species.

186
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,228
We don't like to change.

187
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:26,172
It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.

188
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,939
We probably wouldn't still be here today

189
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,009
if we weren't so resistant to change.

190
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,562
It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,

191
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,508
we discovered that if we carried on

192
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,938
doing the same things, we wouldn't die,

193
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,780
because the things that we've done before

194
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,358
by definition didn't kill us,

195
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,435
and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,

196
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:44,842
we'll be okay,

197
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,510
and it's very sensible not to do anything new,

198
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,970
because it might kill you.

199
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,252
But of course, there are exceptions to that.

200
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,754
Otherwise, we'd never get anywhere.

201
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,520
And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,

202
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,234
is when you can show to people

203
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:59,582
that there might be some self-interest

204
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:01,269
in them making that leap of faith

205
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,536
and changing a little bit.

206
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:05,938
So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years

207
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:09,076
trying to find out what could be that self-interest

208
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,225
that would encourage not just politicians

209
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,778
but also businesses and general populations,

210
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,793
all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,

211
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:19,032
to think in a bigger picture,

212
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,374
not always to look inwards,
sometimes to look outwards.

213
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:24,465
And this is where I discovered

214
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,940
something quite important.

215
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,500
In 2005, I launched a study

216
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,090
called the Nation Brands Index.

217
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,598
What it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls

218
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,685
a very large sample of the world's population,

219
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,182
a sample that represents about 70 percent

220
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,411
of the planet's population,

221
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,447
and I started asking them a series of questions

222
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:48,331
about how they perceive other countries.

223
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,975
And the Nation Brands Index over the years

224
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,478
has grown to be a very, very large database.

225
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,910
It's about 200 billion data points

226
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,486
tracking what ordinary people
think about other countries

227
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,469
and why.

228
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,231
Why did I do this? Well, because
the governments that I advise

229
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,536
are very, very keen on knowing

230
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,151
how they are regarded.

231
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,596
They've known, partly because

232
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,474
I've encouraged them to realize it,

233
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:10,072
that countries depend

234
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,628
enormously on their reputations

235
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:14,575
in order to survive and prosper in the world.

236
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,824
If a country has a great, positive image,

237
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,341
like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,

238
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,436
everything is easy and everything is cheap.

239
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,672
You get more tourists. You get more investors.

240
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:25,719
You sell your products more expensively.

241
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,677
If, on the other hand, you have a country

242
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,690
with a very weak or a very negative image,

243
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,120
everything is difficult and everything is expensive.

244
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,021
So governments care desperately

245
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,286
about the image of their country,

246
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:37,420
because it makes a direct difference

247
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,061
to how much money they can make,

248
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,770
and that's what they've promised their populations

249
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,127
they're going to deliver.

250
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,090
So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take

251
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,319
some time out and speak to that gigantic database

252
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,526
and ask it,

253
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,418
why do some people prefer one country

254
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:54,181
more than another?

255
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,720
And the answer that the database gave me

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,416
completely staggered me.

257
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,605
It was 6.8.

258
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,694
I haven't got time to explain in detail.

259
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:04,050
Basically what it told me was —

260
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,272
(Laughter) (Applause) —

261
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:12,504
the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.

262
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:15,325
We don't admire countries
primarily because they're rich,

263
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,349
because they're powerful,
because they're successful,

264
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,713
because they're modern, because
they're technologically advanced.

265
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,566
We primarily admire countries that are good.

266
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,929
What do we mean by good?

267
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,600
We mean countries that seem to contribute

268
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,169
something to the world in which we live,

269
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,728
countries that actually make the world safer

270
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:34,305
or better or richer or fairer.

271
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,770
Those are the countries we like.

272
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,291
This is a discovery of significant importance —

273
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,644
you see where I'm going —

274
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:41,511
because it squares the circle.

275
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:44,383
I can now say, and often do, to any government,

276
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:47,241
in order to do well, you need to do good.

277
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,736
If you want to sell more products,

278
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,272
if you want to get more investment,

279
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:53,270
if you want to become more competitive,

280
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,935
then you need to start behaving,

281
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,578
because that's why people will respect you

282
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,647
and do business with you,

283
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,730
and therefore, the more you collaborate,

284
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,575
the more competitive you become.

285
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,353
This is quite an important discovery,

286
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:07,433
and as soon as I discovered this,

287
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,678
I felt another index coming on.

288
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:12,024
I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler

289
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:13,320
and more and more childish.

290
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,288
This one is called the Good Country Index,

291
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:21,341
and it does exactly what it says on the tin.

292
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,695
It measures, or at least it tries to measure,

293
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,458
exactly how much each country on Earth contributes

294
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,613
not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.

295
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:30,880
Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,569
of measuring this before.

297
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,616
So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent

298
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,359
the best part of the last two years,

299
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:40,013
with the help of a large number
of very serious and clever people,

300
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,699
cramming together all the reliable data in the world

301
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,342
we could find about what countries give

302
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:46,935
to the world.

303
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:49,313
And you're waiting for me to
tell you which one comes top.

304
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:51,041
And I'm going to tell you,

305
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,571
but first of all I want to tell you

306
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:55,276
precisely what I mean

307
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:57,335
when I say a good country.

308
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,559
I do not mean morally good.

309
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,521
When I say that Country X

310
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,534
is the goodest country on Earth,

311
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,843
and I mean goodest, I don't mean best.

312
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:06,296
Best is something different.

313
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,590
When you're talking about a good country,

314
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,724
you can be good, gooder and goodest.

315
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,196
It's not the same thing as good, better and best.

316
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,697
This is a country which simply gives more

317
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,023
to humanity than any other country.

318
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:19,765
I don't talk about how they behave at home

319
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:22,165
because that's measured elsewhere.

320
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,225
And the winner is

321
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,036
Ireland.

322
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:31,710
(Applause)

323
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,615
According to the data here,

324
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:36,505
no country on Earth, per head of population,

325
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,430
per dollar of GDP, contributes more

326
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,066
to the world that we live in than Ireland.

327
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,161
What does this mean?

328
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,383
This means that as we go to sleep at night,

329
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:47,451
all of us in the last 15 seconds
before we drift off to sleep,

330
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,446
our final thought should be,

331
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:51,763
godammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.

332
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,961
(Laughter)

333
00:12:53,961 --> 00:13:01,058
And that — (Applause) —

334
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:04,058
In the depths of a very severe economic recession,

335
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,576
I think that there's a really important lesson there,

336
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,692
that if you can remember
your international obligations

337
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,662
whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,

338
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:11,700
that's really something.

339
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,355
Finland ranks pretty much the same.

340
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,620
The only reason why it's below Ireland

341
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,703
is because its lowest score is
lower than Ireland's lowest score.

342
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,500
Now the other thing you'll
notice about the top 10 there

343
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,360
is, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,

344
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,070
Western European nations.

345
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,750
They're also all rich.

346
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,490
This depressed me,

347
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,002
because one of the things that I did not want

348
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,580
to discover with this index

349
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,936
is that it's purely the province of rich countries

350
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:33,961
to help poor countries.

351
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,017
This is not what it's all about.

352
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,593
And indeed, if you look further down the list,

353
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:39,919
I don't have the slide here, you will see

354
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,208
something that made me very happy indeed,

355
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,739
that Kenya is in the top 30,

356
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,624
and that demonstrates one
very, very important thing.

357
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:49,487
This is not about money.

358
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,884
This is about attitude.

359
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:52,350
This is about culture.

360
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,797
This is about a government and a people that care

361
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:56,991
about the rest of the world

362
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,983
and have the imagination and the courage

363
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:02,220
to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.

364
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going to whip through the other slides

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,948
just so you can see some
of the lower-lying countries.

366
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:10,230
There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,

367
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,971
Mexico comes 66th,

368
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:14,089
and then we have some of
the big developing countries,

369
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,229
like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.

370
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,233
Countries like China and Russia and India,

371
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,786
which is down in the same part of the index,

372
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,139
well, in some ways, it's not surprising.

373
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,678
They've spent a great deal of time

374
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,841
over the last decades building their own economy,

375
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,527
building their own society and their own polity,

376
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,193
but it is to be hoped

377
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:34,560
that the second phase of their growth

378
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,545
will be somewhat more outward-looking

379
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:39,072
than the first phase has been so far.

380
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,180
And then you can break down each country

381
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,536
in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.

382
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:45,385
I'll allow you to do that.

383
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,047
From midnight tonight it's going
to be on goodcountry.org,

384
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,230
and you can look at the country.

385
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,098
You can look right down to the
level of the individual datasets.

386
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,316
Now that's the Good Country Index.

387
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:56,685
What's it there for?

388
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,970
Well, it's there really because I want to try

389
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,421
to introduce this word,

390
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:05,744
or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.

391
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:07,933
I've had enough hearing about competitive countries.

392
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,728
I've had enough hearing about

393
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:13,514
prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.

394
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,762
I've even had enough hearing about happy countries

395
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,803
because in the end that's still selfish.

396
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:20,307
That's still about us,

397
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,175
and if we carry on thinking about us,

398
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,717
we are in deep, deep trouble.

399
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,348
I think we all know what it is

400
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,471
that we want to hear about.

401
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,516
We want to hear about good countries,

402
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:34,146
and so I want to ask you all a favor.

403
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,742
I'm not asking a lot.

404
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,695
It's something that you might find easy to do

405
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:38,720
and you might even find enjoyable

406
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,323
and even helpful to do,

407
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:43,605
and that's simply to start using the word "good"

408
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,287
in this context.

409
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,474
When you think about your own country,

410
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,603
when you think about other people's countries,

411
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:51,386
when you think about companies,

412
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:53,597
when you talk about the world that we live in today,

413
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,495
start using that word

414
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:58,263
in the way that I've talked about this evening.

415
00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:00,167
Not good, the opposite of bad,

416
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,443
because that's an argument that never finishes.

417
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,787
Good, the opposite of selfish,

418
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,970
good being a country that thinks about all of us.

419
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,380
That's what I would like you to do,

420
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,765
and I'd like you to use it as a stick

421
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:13,408
with which to beat your politicians.

422
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,715
When you elect them, when you reelect them,

423
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,127
when you vote for them, when you listen

424
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,662
to what they're offering you,

425
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,374
use that word, "good,"

426
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:22,858
and ask yourself,

427
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,931
"Is that what a good country would do?"

428
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:28,224
And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.

429
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,649
Ask yourself, is that the behavior

430
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:32,085
of my country?

431
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:34,217
Do I want to come from a country

432
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,784
where the government, in my name,

433
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:37,646
is doing things like that?

434
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,402
Or do I, on the other hand,

435
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,030
prefer the idea of walking around the world

436
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,184
with my head held high thinking, "Yeah,

437
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,675
I'm proud to come from a good country"?

438
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:47,663
And everybody will welcome you.

439
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:49,287
And everybody in the last 15 seconds

440
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,957
before they drift off to sleep at night will say,

441
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,838
"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."

442
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:57,025
Ultimately, that, I think,

443
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,779
is what will make the change.

444
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,496
That word, "good,"

445
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,143
and the number 6.8

446
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:04,401
and the discovery that's behind it

447
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,069
have changed my life.

448
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,956
I think they can change your life,

449
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,815
and I think we can use it to change

450
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:12,235
the way that our politicians
and our companies behave,

451
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:16,100
and in doing so, we can change the world.

452
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,650
I've started thinking very differently about

453
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,343
my own country since I've been
thinking about these things.

454
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,430
I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,

455
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,830
and then I started thinking I
wanted to live in a happy country,

456
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,444
but I began to realize, it's not enough.

457
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,489
I don't want to live in a rich country.

458
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,422
I don't want to live in a fast-growing

459
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:34,105
or competitive country.

460
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:37,223
I want to live in a good country,

461
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,716
and I so, so hope that you do too.

462
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:43,300
Thank you.

463
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,300
(Applause)
