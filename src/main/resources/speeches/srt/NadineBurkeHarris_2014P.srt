1
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,085
In the mid-'90s,

2
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:16,692
the CDC and Kaiser Permanente

3
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:20,812
discovered an exposure
that dramatically increased the risk

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:26,233
for seven out of 10 of the leading
causes of death in the United States.

5
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:30,164
In high doses, it affects
brain development,

6
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,831
the immune system, hormonal systems,

7
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:38,504
and even the way our DNA
is read and transcribed.

8
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:42,025
Folks who are exposed in very high doses

9
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:46,112
have triple the lifetime risk
of heart disease and lung cancer

10
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:50,771
and a 20-year difference
in life expectancy.

11
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:57,413
And yet, doctors today are not trained
in routine screening or treatment.

12
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:03,378
Now, the exposure I'm talking about is
not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.

13
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,808
It's childhood trauma.

14
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:09,506
Okay. What kind of trauma
am I talking about here?

15
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:13,815
I'm not talking about failing a test
or losing a basketball game.

16
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:18,556
I am talking about threats
that are so severe or pervasive

17
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:23,153
that they literally get under our skin
and change our physiology:

18
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,545
things like abuse or neglect,

19
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:29,315
or growing up with a parent 
who struggles with mental illness

20
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,297
or substance dependence.

21
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,264
Now, for a long time,

22
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:36,261
I viewed these things in the way 
I was trained to view them,

23
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:40,353
either as a social problem --
refer to social services --

24
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:44,936
or as a mental health problem --
refer to mental health services.

25
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:51,596
And then something happened
to make me rethink my entire approach.

26
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,468
When I finished my residency,

27
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:57,192
I wanted to go someplace
where I felt really needed,

28
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:00,350
someplace where I could make a difference.

29
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,466
So I came to work for
California Pacific Medical Center,

30
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:07,292
one of the best private hospitals
in Northern California,

31
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:11,820
and together, we opened a clinic
in Bayview-Hunters Point,

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,553
one of the poorest, most underserved
neighborhoods in San Francisco.

33
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,938
Now, prior to that point,

34
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,800
there had been only
one pediatrician in all of Bayview

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,243
to serve more than 10,000 children,

36
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:28,892
so we hung a shingle, and we were able
to provide top-quality care

37
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:30,877
regardless of ability to pay.

38
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:35,039
It was so cool. We targeted
the typical health disparities:

39
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,846
access to care, immunization rates,
asthma hospitalization rates,

40
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,003
and we hit all of our numbers.

41
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,616
We felt very proud of ourselves.

42
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,447
But then I started noticing
a disturbing trend.

43
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:52,337
A lot of kids were being
referred to me for ADHD,

44
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:55,334
or Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder,

45
00:02:55,334 --> 00:03:00,216
but when I actually did
a thorough history and physical,

46
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:03,415
what I found was that
for most of my patients,

47
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:06,454
I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.

48
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:12,654
Most of the kids I was seeing
had experienced such severe trauma

49
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:16,044
that it felt like something else
was going on.

50
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:20,026
Somehow I was missing something important.

51
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:25,137
Now, before I did my residency,
I did a master's degree in public health,

52
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:28,230
and one of the things that they teach you
in public health school

53
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,115
is that if you're a doctor

54
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,899
and you see 100 kids
that all drink from the same well,

55
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:37,297
and 98 of them develop diarrhea,

56
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,583
you can go ahead
and write that prescription

57
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,912
for dose after dose
after dose of antibiotics,

58
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:49,735
or you can walk over and say,
"What the hell is in this well?"

59
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:53,528
So I began reading everything that
I could get my hands on

60
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:56,082
about how exposure to adversity

61
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:59,561
affects the developing brains
and bodies of children.

62
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,466
And then one day,
my colleague walked into my office,

63
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:07,880
and he said, "Dr. Burke,
have you seen this?"

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,722
In his hand was a copy
of a research study

65
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,939
called the Adverse Childhood
Experiences Study.

66
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:23,512
That day changed my clinical practice
and ultimately my career.

67
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,393
The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study

68
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:29,625
is something that everybody
needs to know about.

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:34,956
It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser
and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,

70
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:43,154
and together, they asked 17,500 adults
about their history of exposure

71
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:47,871
to what they called "adverse 
childhood experiences," or ACEs.

72
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:52,658
Those include physical, emotional,
or sexual abuse;

73
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:56,584
physical or emotional neglect;

74
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:59,678
parental mental illness,
substance dependence, incarceration;

75
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:02,457
parental separation or divorce;

76
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,992
or domestic violence.

77
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:09,428
For every yes, you would get
a point on your ACE score.

78
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:10,936
And then what they did

79
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:16,186
was they correlated these ACE scores
against health outcomes.

80
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,493
What they found was striking.

81
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,788
Two things:

82
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:25,050
Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.

83
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,854
Sixty-seven percent of the population
had at least one ACE,

84
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:37,693
and 12.6 percent, one in eight,
had four or more ACEs.

85
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,791
The second thing that they found

86
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,253
was that there was
a dose-response relationship

87
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:48,853
between ACEs and health outcomes:

88
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,772
the higher your ACE score,
the worse your health outcomes.

89
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:56,023
For a person with an ACE score
of four or more,

90
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,715
their relative risk of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease

91
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:04,266
was two and a half times that
of someone with an ACE score of zero.

92
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,190
For hepatitis, it was also
two and a half times.

93
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,510
For depression, it was
four and a half times.

94
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,943
For suicidality, it was 12 times.

95
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:18,108
A person with an ACE score
of seven or more

96
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:22,678
had triple the lifetime risk
of lung cancer

97
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:26,649
and three and a half times the risk
of ischemic heart disease,

98
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,794
the number one killer
in the United States of America.

99
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,707
Well, of course this makes sense.

100
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:38,374
Some people looked at this data
and they said, "Come on.

101
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:43,196
You have a rough childhood,
you're more likely to drink and smoke

102
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:46,011
and do all these things
that are going to ruin your health.

103
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,806
This isn't science.
This is just bad behavior."

104
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:55,545
It turns out this is exactly
where the science comes in.

105
00:06:55,545 --> 00:07:00,199
We now understand
better than we ever have before

106
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,451
how exposure to early adversity

107
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,539
affects the developing brains
and bodies of children.

108
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,325
It affects areas like
the nucleus accumbens,

109
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,856
the pleasure and reward
center of the brain

110
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,502
that is implicated
in substance dependence.

111
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,224
It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,

112
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:21,281
which is necessary for impulse control
and executive function,

113
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:23,348
a critical area for learning.

114
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:25,036
And on MRI scans,

115
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:29,024
we see measurable differences
in the amygdala,

116
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,666
the brain's fear response center.

117
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:35,586
So there are real neurologic reasons

118
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:39,116
why folks exposed
to high doses of adversity

119
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:42,413
are more likely to engage
in high-risk behavior,

120
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,317
and that's important to know.

121
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:49,936
But it turns out that even if you don't
engage in any high-risk behavior,

122
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:55,077
you're still more likely
to develop heart disease or cancer.

123
00:07:55,921 --> 00:08:01,846
The reason for this has to do with
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,

124
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:05,516
the brain's and body's
stress response system

125
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:09,296
that governs our fight-or-flight response.

126
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,251
How does it work?

127
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:14,989
Well, imagine you're walking
in the forest and you see a bear.

128
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:19,146
Immediately, your hypothalamus
sends a signal to your pituitary,

129
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,747
which sends a signal 
to your adrenal gland that says,

130
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:25,298
"Release stress hormones!
Adrenaline! Cortisol!"

131
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,919
And so your heart starts to pound,

132
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,053
Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,

133
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:36,302
and you are ready to either
fight that bear or run from the bear.

134
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:38,618
And that is wonderful

135
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,109
if you're in a forest
and there's a bear.

136
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,663
(Laughter)

137
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:50,076
But the problem is what happens
when the bear comes home every night,

138
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:55,724
and this system is activated
over and over and over again,

139
00:08:55,724 --> 00:09:00,228
and it goes from being
adaptive, or life-saving,

140
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:04,353
to maladaptive, or health-damaging.

141
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:09,856
Children are especially sensitive
to this repeated stress activation,

142
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:13,090
because their brains and bodies
are just developing.

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,895
High doses of adversity not only affect
brain structure and function,

144
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:23,121
they affect the developing immune system,

145
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,964
developing hormonal systems,

146
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:30,653
and even the way our DNA
is read and transcribed.

147
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:36,691
So for me, this information
threw my old training out the window,

148
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,638
because when we understand
the mechanism of a disease,

149
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:45,375
when we know not only
which pathways are disrupted, but how,

150
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:50,036
then as doctors, it is our job
to use this science

151
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,665
for prevention and treatment.

152
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,358
That's what we do.

153
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:58,611
So in San Francisco, we created
the Center for Youth Wellness

154
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:04,044
to prevent, screen and heal the impacts
of ACEs and toxic stress.

155
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:08,627
We started simply with routine screening
of every one of our kids

156
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,154
at their regular physical,

157
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:14,858
because I know that if my patient 
has an ACE score of 4,

158
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:19,415
she's two and a half times as likely
to develop hepatitis or COPD,

159
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:22,317
she's four and half times as likely
to become depressed,

160
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:26,380
and she's 12 times as likely
to attempt to take her own life

161
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,680
as my patient with zero ACEs.

162
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,339
I know that when she's in my exam room.

163
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,833
For our patients who do screen positive,

164
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:40,055
we have a multidisciplinary treatment team
that works to reduce the dose of adversity

165
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:45,938
and treat symptoms using best practices,
including home visits, care coordination,

166
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:49,852
mental health care, nutrition,

167
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:54,567
holistic interventions, and yes,
medication when necessary.

168
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:59,256
But we also educate parents
about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress

169
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:04,766
the same way you would for covering
electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,

170
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:08,706
and we tailor the care
of our asthmatics and our diabetics

171
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:13,164
in a way that recognizes that they may
need more aggressive treatment,

172
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:17,591
given the changes to their hormonal
and immune systems.

173
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:21,683
So the other thing that happens
when you understand this science

174
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,681
is that you want to shout it
from the rooftops,

175
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:29,011
because this isn't just an issue
for kids in Bayview.

176
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,645
I figured the minute
that everybody else heard about this,

177
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:36,128
it would be routine screening,
multi-disciplinary treatment teams,

178
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:40,925
and it would be a race to the most
effective clinical treatment protocols.

179
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:45,045
Yeah. That did not happen.

180
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:47,900
And that was a huge learning for me.

181
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,707
What I had thought of as simply
best clinical practice

182
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:56,265
I now understand to be a movement.

183
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:59,295
In the words of Dr. Robert Block,

184
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:02,996
the former President
of the American Academy of Pediatrics,

185
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:05,948
"Adverse childhood experiences

186
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:10,958
are the single greatest
unaddressed public health threat

187
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,207
facing our nation today."

188
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:17,853
And for a lot of people,
that's a terrifying prospect.

189
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:23,658
The scope and scale of the problem
seems so large that it feels overwhelming

190
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,282
to think about how we might approach it.

191
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:30,689
But for me, that's actually
where the hopes lies,

192
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,353
because when we have the right framework,

193
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:38,610
when we recognize this to be
a public health crisis,

194
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,614
then we can begin to use the right 
tool kit to come up with solutions.

195
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,342
From tobacco to lead poisoning 
to HIV/AIDS,

196
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:52,355
the United States actually has
quite a strong track record

197
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,259
with addressing public health problems,

198
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,762
but replicating those successes
with ACEs and toxic stress

199
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:05,359
is going to take determination
and commitment,

200
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:09,331
and when I look at what
our nation's response has been so far,

201
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,175
I wonder,

202
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:14,974
why haven't we taken this more seriously?

203
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,796
You know, at first I thought
that we marginalized the issue

204
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,720
because it doesn't apply to us.

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,018
That's an issue for those kids
in those neighborhoods.

206
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:28,207
Which is weird, because the data
doesn't bear that out.

207
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,340
The original ACEs study
was done in a population

208
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,127
that was 70 percent Caucasian,

209
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:38,285
70 percent college-educated.

210
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,767
But then, the more I talked to folks,

211
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:46,274
I'm beginning to think that maybe
I had it completely backwards.

212
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:53,098
If I were to ask
how many people in this room

213
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,777
grew up with a family member
who suffered from mental illness,

214
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,873
I bet a few hands would go up.

215
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:05,574
And then if I were to ask how many folks
had a parent who maybe drank too much,

216
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:10,087
or who really believed that
if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,

217
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:14,015
I bet a few more hands would go up.

218
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:19,096
Even in this room, this is an issue
that touches many of us,

219
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:22,485
and I am beginning to believe
that we marginalize the issue

220
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:25,081
because it does apply to us.

221
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,941
Maybe it's easier to see
in other zip codes

222
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,844
because we don't want to look at it.

223
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,922
We'd rather be sick.

224
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:40,260
Fortunately, scientific advances
and, frankly, economic realities

225
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,304
make that option less viable every day.

226
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,931
The science is clear:

227
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:52,760
Early adversity dramatically affects
health across a lifetime.

228
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,452
Today, we are beginning to understand
how to interrupt the progression

229
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:02,753
from early adversity
to disease and early death,

230
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:05,278
and 30 years from now,

231
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,786
the child who has a high ACE score

232
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:10,891
and whose behavioral symptoms
go unrecognized,

233
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:13,591
whose asthma management
is not connected,

234
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:16,795
and who goes on to develop
high blood pressure

235
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:19,639
and early heart disease or cancer

236
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,783
will be just as anomalous
as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.

237
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:29,268
People will look at that situation
and say, "What the heck happened there?"

238
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,575
This is treatable.

239
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:35,347
This is beatable.

240
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:39,510
The single most important thing
that we need today

241
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,837
is the courage to look
this problem in the face

242
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:47,909
and say, this is real
and this is all of us.

243
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:52,646
I believe that we are the movement.

244
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,024
Thank you.

245
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:57,487
(Applause)
