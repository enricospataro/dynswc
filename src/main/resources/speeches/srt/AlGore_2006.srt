1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,820
to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice. I'm extremely grateful.

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
nice comments about what I had to say the other night.

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:46,820
And I say that sincerely, partly because -- (Mock sob) -- I need that! (Laughter)

6
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Put yourselves in my position!

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.

8
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!

9
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,820
(Laughter) (Applause)

10
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,820
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.

11
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.

12
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) -- White House -- (Laughter) --

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have

14
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
50 miles east of Nashville --

15
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,820
driving ourselves.

16
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,820
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) --

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:56,820
I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.

18
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,820
There was no motorcade back there.

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,820
You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter)

20
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:15,820
This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime,

21
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
and we started looking for a place to eat.

22
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,820
We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
We got off the exit, started looking for a -- we found a Shoney's restaurant.

24
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,

26
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,820
made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter)

27
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us,

28
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,820
and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.

29
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
She said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper."

30
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?" (Laughter)

31
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,820
There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,820
The very next day, continuing a totally true story,

33
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I got on a G-5 to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,

34
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.

35
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,820
I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened

36
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
the day before in Nashville.

37
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain,

39
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
what the man said -- they laughed.

40
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.

41
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
I fell asleep on the plane, until during the middle of the night,

42
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.

43
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,

44
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,820
and I looked and there was a man running across the runway.

45
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,

46
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,820
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

47
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic,

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
what in the world could be wrong in Washington?

49
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.

50
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:21,820
(Laughter)

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,820
But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,820
one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech.

53
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,820
And it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America

54
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,820
-- it was printed in Monterey, I checked. And the story began,

55
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,

56
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:55,820
'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant, named Shoney's,

57
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,820
and we are running it ourselves.'" (Laughter)

58
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Before I could get back to U.S. soil,

59
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,820
David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on

60
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
-- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat,

61
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Tipper was saying, "One more burger, with fries!"

62
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner

63
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,820
and colleague Bill Clinton saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"

64
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,820
(Laughter)

65
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:39,820
We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.

66
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
I was going to talk about information ecology.

67
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,820
But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,820
that maybe I could talk about that another time. (Applause)

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!

70
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on.

71
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,820
What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with --

72
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.

73
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it.

74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,820
I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it.

75
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
It's like beachcombing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out,

76
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
you find some more shells.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.

78
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,820
This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for

79
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,820
January is 31 degrees. Last month was 39.5 degrees.

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,820
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment

81
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,820
-- I'm kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides,

82
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,820
and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.

83
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,820
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming,

85
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:18,820
under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy

86
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation:

87
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,820
it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong.

88
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,820
It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves.

89
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.

90
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow,

91
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,820
but I want you to put it in perspective.

92
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,820
It's an easy, visible target of concern, and it should be,

93
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,820
but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings

94
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
than from cars and trucks.

95
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world,

96
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
and so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.

97
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks!

98
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency

99
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,820
can make this much difference, and with what Vinod, and John Doerr, and others,

100
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,820
many of you here -- a lot of people directly involved in this

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,820
-- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it.

102
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for

103
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,820
-- is likely to become the killer app

104
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:50,820
that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.

105
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Not quite there yet.

106
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,820
OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home.

107
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.

108
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Insulation, better design, buy green electricity where you can.

109
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,820
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail.

110
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.

111
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy,

112
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
between things that have a harsh effect or a much less

113
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,820
harsh effect on the global climate crisis.

114
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Consider this. Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.

115
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Those of you who are good at branding,

116
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I'd love to get your advice and help on

117
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,820
how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.

118
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,820
It is easier than you think. It really is.

119
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,820
A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy.

120
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:12,820
It means: reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make,

121
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,820
and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not

122
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:27,820
completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.

123
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:34,820
There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened,

124
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,820
with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world

125
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a

126
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
consumer-friendly carbon calculator.

127
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,820
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,

128
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
and then you will be given options to reduce.

129
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,820
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0

130
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,820
and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.

131
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that,

132
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,820
and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,

133
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
whether you are from the technology, or entertainment,

134
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
or design and architecture community.

135
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this.

136
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you

137
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,820
compensate on the basis of their annual performance,

138
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,820
don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.

139
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much

140
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,820
they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested,

141
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,820
based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions.

142
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
A lot more to be said about that.

143
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Become a catalyst of change. Teach others; learn about it; talk about it.

144
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
The movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow

145
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May.

146
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.

147
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well.

148
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,820
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow, re-purposed,

149
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,820
with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach,

150
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,820
and -- it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together.

151
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,820
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer

152
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,820
for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it,

153
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
en masse, in communities all across the country,

154
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week

155
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

156
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,

157
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,820
posted with tools and limited-use copyrights,

158
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,820
so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.

159
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
(Applause)

160
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?

161
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,820
It doesn't mean that if you are a Republican that I'm trying to convince you to be a

162
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue,

163
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active.

164
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.

165
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions, global warming pollution,

166
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,820
and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,

167
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
it's not a closed system.

168
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,

169
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
then everybody who's on a board of directors

170
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,820
-- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?

171
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO

172
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,820
to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions

173
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:33,820
that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this.

174
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.

175
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently the

176
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.

177
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,820
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes

178
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.

179
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,820
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.

180
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
We have to buy a lot of those ads.

181
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Let's rebrand global warming, as many of you have suggested.

182
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"

183
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,820
but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.

184
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,

185
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,820
is whether the combination of an opposable thumb

186
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,820
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

187
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:35,820
That's really true. I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue.

188
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Again, the Republicans here, this shouldn't be partisan.

189
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.

190
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:51,820
This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,

191
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
to bring more coherence to them.

192
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
We are one.

193
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

194
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:05,820
(Applause)
