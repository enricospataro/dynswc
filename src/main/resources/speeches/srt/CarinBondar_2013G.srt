1
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:15,192
Anyone in the room thought about sex today?

2
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:16,352
(Laughter)

3
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,557
Yeah, you did.

4
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:20,023
Thank you for putting your hand up over there.

5
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:21,743
Well, I'm here to provide you with

6
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,438
some biological validation

7
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:24,868
for your sordid daydreams.

8
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:26,262
I'm here to tell you a few things

9
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:29,768
that you might not have known about wild sex.

10
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,616
Now, when humans think about sex,

11
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,346
male and female forms

12
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:35,017
are generally what come to mind,

13
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:37,470
but for many millions of years,

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,091
such specific categories didn't even exist.

15
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:42,694
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies

16
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,304
or a trickle of DNA

17
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:46,846
shared between two or more beings.

18
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,171
It wasn't until about 500 million years ago

19
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:52,535
that we start to see structures akin to a penis

20
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:55,193
or a thing that gives DNA out,

21
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:58,347
and a vagina, something that receives it.

22
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:00,672
Now invariably, you're probably thinking about

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,092
what belongs to our own species,

24
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,990
these very familiar structures,

25
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,276
but the diversity that we see in sexual structures

26
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,264
in the animal kingdom that has evolved

27
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:11,912
in response to the multitude of factors

28
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,573
surrounding reproduction

29
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,967
is pretty mind-blowing.

30
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,608
Penile diversity is especially profuse.

31
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:21,753
So this is a paper nautilus.

32
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:24,663
It's a close relative of squid and octopus,

33
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:27,785
and males have a hectocotylus.

34
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:29,535
Just what is a hectocotylus?

35
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:33,714
A detachable, swimming penis.

36
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:36,123
It leaves the [body of the male],

37
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,323
finds the female through
pheromonal cues in the water,

38
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,234
attaches itself to her body

39
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,542
and deposits the sperm.

40
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,066
For many decades, biologists actually felt

41
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:49,511
that the hectocotylus was a
separate organism altogether.

42
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:52,499
Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.

43
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:55,447
And the tapir has a prehensile penis.

44
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,489
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis

45
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,915
much akin to what we have with our hands.

46
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,587
And it uses this dexterity

47
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:04,803
to bypass the vagina altogether

48
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:08,174
and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,

49
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:11,728
not to mention it's a pretty good size.

50
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,657
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,

51
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,352
however, is not that of the tapir.

52
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,684
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio

53
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,378
in the animal kingdom actually belongs

54
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,629
to the meager beach barnacle,

55
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,821
and this video is actually showing you

56
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,905
what the human penis would look like

57
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:29,366
if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.

58
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,552
(Laughter)

59
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,815
Mm-hm. (Laughter)

60
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,613
So with all of this diversity in structure,

61
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,770
one might think, then, that penises

62
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,741
are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place

63
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,818
for the purposes of successful reproduction.

64
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,363
Simply insert part A into slot B,

65
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,438
and we should all be good to go.

66
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,767
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,

67
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,695
and that's because we can't
just take form into account.

68
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,977
We have to think about function as well,

69
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,767
and when it comes to sex,

70
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,293
function relates to the contributions made

71
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:04,092
by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.

72
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:07,426
And these contributions are far from equal.

73
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,812
Eggs are very expensive to make,

74
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,763
so it makes sense for females to be very choosy

75
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:15,200
about who she shares them with.

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,013
Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,

77
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:20,865
so it makes more sense for males

78
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,015
to have a more-sex-is-better strategy

79
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,427
when it comes to siring members

80
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,273
of future generations.

81
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,985
So how do animals cope

82
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,870
with these very incongruent
needs between the sexes?

83
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,119
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,

84
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,558
or if she has the ability to store sperm

85
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,235
and she simply has enough,

86
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,308
then it makes more sense for her to spend her time

87
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,986
doing other biologically relevant things:

88
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:45,843
avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,

89
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,013
gathering and ingesting food.

90
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,326
This is, of course, bad news for any male

91
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,877
who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,

92
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:55,982
and this sets the scene for
some pretty drastic strategies

93
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:59,288
for successful fertilization.

94
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,295
This is bedbug sex,

95
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:05,569
and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.

96
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,363
Males have a spiked, barbed penis

97
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,967
that they literally stab into the female,

98
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,828
and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.

99
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,963
They stab it anywhere in her body,

100
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,760
and the sperm simply migrates

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,064
through her hemolymph to her ovaries.

102
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,208
If a female gets too many stab wounds,

103
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,554
or if a stab wound happens to become infected,

104
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,933
she can actually die from it.

105
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,704
Now if you've ever been out for a nice,

106
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,595
peaceful walk by the lake

107
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,337
and happened to see some ducks having sex,

108
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,032
you've undoubtedly been alarmed,

109
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:38,543
because it looks like gang rape.

110
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:41,204
And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.

111
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,424
A group of males will grab a female,

112
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,593
hold her down,

113
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:49,023
and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis

114
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,107
into her corkscrew-shaped vagina

115
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:55,013
over and over and over again.

116
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:58,802
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.

117
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,937
Now the female actually
gets the last laugh, though,

118
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:03,764
because she can actually manipulate her posture

119
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:06,869
so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors

120
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:10,131
better access to her ovaries.

121
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:12,241
Now, I like to share stories
like this with my audiences

122
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,697
because, yeah, we humans,

123
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:16,842
we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,

124
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,083
there's romance, and there's orgasm.

125
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,765
But orgasm didn't actually evolve

126
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,851
until about 65 million years ago

127
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,618
with the advent of mammals.

128
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,482
But some animals had it going
on quite a bit before that.

129
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,236
There are some more primitive ways

130
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,637
of pleasing one's partner.

131
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:33,693
Earwig males have either

132
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,451
really large penile appendages

133
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:36,852
or really small ones.

134
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,673
It's a very simple genetically inherited trait

135
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,659
and the males are not otherwise any different.

136
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,621
Those that have long penile appendages

137
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,389
are not bigger or stronger

138
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:46,893
or otherwise any different at all.

139
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,434
So going back to our biological minds, then,

140
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,551
we might think that females should choose

141
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,532
to have sex with the guys that
have the shorter appendages,

142
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,097
because she can use her time for other things:

143
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,773
avoiding predators, taking care of young,

144
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,621
finding and ingesting food.

145
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,437
But biologists have repeatedly observed

146
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,405
that females choose to have sex

147
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:09,534
with the males that have the long appendages.

148
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,497
Why do they do this?

149
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,896
Well, according to the biological literature,

150
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,723
"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males

151
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,343
may elicit more favorable female responses

152
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:22,420
through superior mechanical
or stimulatory interaction

153
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,978
with the female reproductive tract."

154
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,369
Mm-hm.

155
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,306
These are Mexican guppies,

156
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,437
and what you see on their upper maxilla

157
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,839
is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,

158
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,684
and these filaments basically form

159
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:39,282
a fish mustache, if you will.

160
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,624
Now males have been observed to prod

161
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,288
the female's genital opening

162
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,235
prior to copulating with her,

163
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:48,744
and in what I have lovingly termed
the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,

164
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:52,756
females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found

165
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:56,721
with males that have these fish mustaches.

166
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:00,018
A little guppy porn for you right there.

167
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:02,774
So we've seen very different strategies

168
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,012
that males are using when it comes to

169
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,608
winning a female partner.

170
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:11,596
We've seen a coercion strategy in which
sexual structures are used in a forceful way

171
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,369
to basically make a female have sex.

172
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,426
We've also seen a titillation strategy

173
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:17,363
where males are actually

174
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,511
pleasing their female partners into choosing them

175
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,230
as a sex partner.

176
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,675
Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,

177
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:26,091
it's the coercion strategy that we see

178
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,830
time and time again.

179
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,177
It's very common in many phyla,

180
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,810
from invertebrates to avian species,

181
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,356
mammals, and, of course, even in primates.

182
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:38,893
Now interestingly, there 
are a few mammalian species

183
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:42,125
in which females have evolved specialized genitalia

184
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:46,794
that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.

185
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:49,162
Female elephants and female hyenas

186
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,536
have a penile clitoris,

187
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:55,343
or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,

188
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,902
much like a penis,

189
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,286
and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals

190
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,453
by merely looking at their external morphology.

191
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,045
So before a male can insert
his penis into a female's vagina,

192
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,900
she has to take this penile clitoris

193
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,463
and basically inside-out it in her own body.

194
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:14,400
I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,932
It's simply not going to happen

196
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:19,254
unless the female is on board with the action.

197
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,067
Now, even more interesting is the fact

198
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,076
that elephant and hyena societies

199
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,505
are entirely matriarchal:

200
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,007
they're run by females, groups of females,

201
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,253
sisters, aunts and offspring,

202
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,456
and when young males attain sexual maturity,

203
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,333
they're turfed out of the group.

204
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,416
In hyena societies, adult males

205
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,678
are actually the lowest on the social scale.

206
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:43,111
They can take part in a kill only after

207
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:45,841
everybody else, including the offspring.

208
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,159
So it seems that when you take the penis power

209
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,997
away from a male,

210
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:54,056
you take away all the social power he has.

211
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,698
So what are my take-home
messages from my talk today?

212
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,379
Well, sex is just so much more

213
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,978
than insert part A into slot B

214
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:05,120
and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,777
The sexual strategies and reproductive structures

216
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:10,800
that we see in the animal kingdom basically

217
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,728
dictate how males and females
will react to each other,

218
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,474
which then dictates how populations and societies

219
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,089
form and evolve.

220
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:21,573
So it may not be surprising to any of you

221
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,381
that animals, including ourselves,

222
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,991
spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,

223
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,167
but what might surprise you is the extent to which

224
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:34,238
so many other aspects of their lives and our lives

225
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:36,060
are influenced by it.

226
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,023
So thank you, and happy daydreaming.

227
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:42,102
(Applause)
