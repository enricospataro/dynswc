1
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,181
What you have here

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,083
is an electronic cigarette.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:21,078
It's something that's, since it was invented a year or two ago,

4
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:23,030
has given me untold happiness.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,305
(Laughter)

6
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:26,763
A little bit of it, I think, is the nicotine,

7
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:28,651
but there's something much bigger than that.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,464
Which is ever since, in the U.K., they banned smoking in public places,

9
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:37,643
I've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again.

10
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:38,866
(Laughter)

11
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:42,335
And the reason, I only worked out just the other day,

12
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,063
which is when you go to a drinks party

13
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,185
and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine

14
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:47,870
and you talk endlessly to people,

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,430
you don't actually want to spend all the time talking.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,072
It's really, really tiring.

17
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:55,947
Sometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts.

18
00:00:55,947 --> 00:01:00,803
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window.

19
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,811
Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,

20
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,429
if you stand and stare out of the window on your own,

21
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,525
you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.

22
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,917
(Laughter)

23
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,831
If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette,

24
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,450
you're a fucking philosopher.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,153
(Laughter)

26
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:25,481
(Applause)

27
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:30,074
So the power of reframing things

28
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:33,426
cannot be overstated.

29
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,976
What we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity,

30
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,308
but one of them makes you feel great

31
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,481
and the other one, with just a small change of posture,

32
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,185
makes you feel terrible.

33
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,743
And I think one of the problems with classical economics

34
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,675
is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.

35
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,987
And reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness.

36
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:57,122
Why, for example,

37
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,264
are pensioners much happier

38
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,616
than the young unemployed?

39
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:06,079
Both of them, after all, are in exactly the same stage of life.

40
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,376
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money.

41
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:12,420
But pensioners are reportedly very, very happy,

42
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,299
whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.

43
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,472
The reason, I think, is that the pensioners believe they've chosen to be pensioners,

44
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,791
whereas the young unemployed

45
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,897
feel it's been thrust upon them.

46
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:29,557
In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly,

47
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,278
because they've re-branded unemployment.

48
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,874
If you're an upper-middle-class English person,

49
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,568
you call unemployment "a year off."

50
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,318
(Laughter)

51
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,120
And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,059
is really quite embarrassing,

53
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:48,022
but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand

54
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:50,565
is really viewed as quite an accomplishment.

55
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,028
(Laughter)

56
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:54,714
But actually the power to re-brand things --

57
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:59,650
to understand that actually our experiences, costs, things

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,606
don't actually much depend on what they really are,

59
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,337
but on how we view them --

60
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:06,820
I genuinely think can't be overstated.

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,432
There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to

62
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:12,272
where you put two dogs in a box

63
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:16,551
and the box has an electric floor.

64
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:21,003
Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor,

65
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,584
which pains the dogs.

66
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:28,434
The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box.

67
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:32,043
And when it nuzzles the button, the electric shock stops.

68
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:35,166
The other dog doesn't have the button.

69
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:39,722
It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box,

70
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,308
but it has no control over the circumstances.

71
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:46,497
Generally the first dog can be relatively content.

72
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:49,990
The second dog lapses into complete depression.

73
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,141
The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness

74
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:59,737
than the sense of control we feel over our lives.

75
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:02,289
It's an interesting question.

76
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,793
We ask the question -- the whole debate in the Western world

77
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:07,559
is about the level of taxation.

78
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,778
But I think there's another debate to be asked,

79
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:13,170
which is the level of control we have over our tax money.

80
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,459
That what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse.

81
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,324
What costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome.

82
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:27,528
You know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health

83
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,905
and you're merely feeling a mug.

84
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:33,607
Pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward

85
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,770
and you're called a philanthropist.

86
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,806
I'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax.

87
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:41,716
(Laughter)

88
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:46,897
So I'll give you one in return. How you frame things really matters.

89
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,985
Do you call it the bailout of Greece

90
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:52,766
or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece?

91
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,487
Because they are actually the same thing.

92
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,885
What you call them actually affects

93
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:01,399
how you react to them, viscerally and morally.

94
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,776
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest.

95
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,906
One of my great friends, a professor called Nick Chater,

96
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,533
who's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London,

97
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:13,055
believes that we should spend far less time

98
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,020
looking into humanity's hidden depths

99
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,153
and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows.

100
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:19,903
I think that's true actually.

101
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,715
I think impressions have an insane effect

102
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,870
on what we think and what we do.

103
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,215
But what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology.

104
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,053
At least pre-Kahneman perhaps,

105
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,127
we didn't have a really good model of human psychology

106
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:38,866
to put alongside models of engineering, of neoclassical economics.

107
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:42,890
So people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model.

108
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,660
We didn't have a framework.

109
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,504
This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls

110
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,612
"a latticework on which to hang your ideas."

111
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:53,511
Engineers, economists, classical economists

112
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,676
all had a very, very robust existing latticework

113
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:59,650
on which practically every idea could be hung.

114
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,911
We merely have a collection of random individual insights

115
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,403
without an overall model.

116
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:09,397
And what that means is that in looking at solutions,

117
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:12,028
we've probably given too much priority

118
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:16,464
to what I call technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions,

119
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:19,112
and not nearly enough to the psychological ones.

120
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,156
You know my example of the Eurostar.

121
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,737
Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time

122
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:27,860
between Paris and London by about 40 minutes.

123
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,016
For 0.01 percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains,

124
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,687
which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey,

125
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:38,650
but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more.

126
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,737
For maybe 10 percent of the money,

127
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:44,056
you could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels

128
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:49,418
to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers.

129
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,611
You'd still have five [million] pounds in change,

130
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,389
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

131
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,141
(Laughter)

132
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,952
Why were we not given the chance

133
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,153
to solve that problem psychologically?

134
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:05,939
I think it's because there's an imbalance, an asymmetry,

135
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,885
in the way we treat creative, emotionally-driven psychological ideas

136
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:16,036
versus the way we treat rational, numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.

137
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,558
If you're a creative person, I think quite rightly,

138
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,678
you have to share all your ideas for approval

139
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,778
with people much more rational than you.

140
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:26,528
You have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis,

141
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,407
a feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth.

142
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,663
And I think that's probably right.

143
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:34,243
But this does not apply the other way around.

144
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,830
People who have an existing framework,

145
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,365
an economic framework, an engineering framework,

146
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,651
feel that actually logic is its own answer.

147
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,658
What they don't say is, "Well the numbers all seem to add up,

148
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,776
but before I present this idea, I'll go and show it to some really crazy people

149
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:51,629
to see if they can come up with something better."

150
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,397
And so we, artificially I think, prioritize

151
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:58,693
what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas.

152
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,222
An example of a great psychological idea:

153
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:06,195
The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent

154
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:11,224
came when they didn't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains,

155
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,828
they put dot matrix display board on the platforms.

156
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,278
Because the nature of a wait

157
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:20,351
is not just dependent on its numerical quality, its duration,

158
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,274
but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait.

159
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:26,558
Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock

160
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,772
is less frustrating and irritating

161
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,799
than waiting four minutes, knuckle-biting

162
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:33,987
going, "When's this train going to damn well arrive?"

163
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:37,889
Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea.

164
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,452
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.

165
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,691
It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments.

166
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,693
Why? Because road rage, impatience and general irritation

167
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:51,852
are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait.

168
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:54,862
In China, not really understanding the principle behind this,

169
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,596
they applied the same principle to green traffic lights.

170
00:08:57,596 --> 00:09:00,470
(Laughter)

171
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,362
Which isn't a great idea.

172
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:07,690
You're 200 yards away, you realize you've got five seconds to go, you floor it.

173
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,709
(Laughter)

174
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,112
The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.

175
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:16,233
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights;

176
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:19,301
it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.

177
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:22,262
This is all I'm asking for really in human decision making,

178
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,218
is the consideration of these three things.

179
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,274
I'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other.

180
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,325
I'm merely saying that when you solve problems,

181
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,627
you should look at all three of these equally

182
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,153
and you should seek as far as possible

183
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,987
to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle.

184
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,195
If you actually look at a great business,

185
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,807
you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play.

186
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,101
Really, really successful businesses --

187
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,607
Google is great, great technological success,

188
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:50,341
but it's also based on a very good psychological insight:

189
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,541
People believe something that only does one thing

190
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,743
is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else.

191
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:01,695
It's an innate thing called goal dilution.

192
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,693
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this.

193
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:06,012
Everybody else at the time of Google, more or less,

194
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,368
was trying to be a portal.

195
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,684
Yes, there's a search function,

196
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:12,510
but you also have weather, sports scores, bits of news.

197
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,028
Google understood that if you're just a search engine,

198
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:18,691
people assume you're a very, very good search engine.

199
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,272
All of you know this actually

200
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,957
from when you go in to buy a television.

201
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:25,520
And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs

202
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,822
you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players.

203
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,914
And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things,

204
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:37,862
but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.

205
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:42,268
It's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."

206
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,558
So we walk out of the shops with one of each.

207
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:49,862
Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one.

208
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,764
I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems

209
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,547
that we didn't even realize were problems at all.

210
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,647
This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics.

211
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,030
Don't give them 24 white pills.

212
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,901
Give them 18 white pills and six blue ones

213
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:07,703
and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones.

214
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,570
It's called chunking.

215
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,674
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater

216
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,278
when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle.

217
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,237
One of the great mistakes, I think, of economics

218
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,664
is it fails to understand that what something is,

219
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:24,691
whether it's retirement, unemployment, cost,

220
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,991
is a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning.

221
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:32,153
This is a toll crossing in Britain.

222
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:35,678
Quite often queues happen at the tolls.

223
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,780
Sometimes you get very, very severe queues.

224
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,778
You could apply the same principle actually, if you like,

225
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,403
to the security lanes in airports.

226
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,228
What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge,

227
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,612
but go through a lane that's an express lane?

228
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:51,347
It's not an unreasonable thing to do. It's an economically efficient thing to do.

229
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,812
Time means more to some people than others.

230
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,112
If you're waiting trying to get to a job interview,

231
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:00,079
you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane.

232
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,050
If you're on the way to visit your mother in-law,

233
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,107
you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.

234
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:11,535
The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution,

235
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,220
people hate it.

236
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,070
Because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge

237
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,607
in order to maximize your revenue,

238
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:21,580
and "Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence?"

239
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,912
On the other hand, change the frame slightly

240
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,320
and create charitable yield management,

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,391
so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company, it goes to charity,

242
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,607
and the mental willingness to pay completely changes.

243
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:37,935
You have a relatively economically efficient solution,

244
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,654
but one that actually meets with public approval

245
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,843
and even a small degree of affection,

246
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:45,564
rather than being seen as bastardy.

247
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,797
So where economists make the fundamental mistake

248
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:51,165
is they think that money is money.

249
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:56,295
Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds

250
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:58,395
is not just proportionate to the amount,

251
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,557
but where I think that money is going.

252
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:03,576
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy.

253
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,972
It could revolutionize the public services.

254
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,599
It could really change things quite significantly.

255
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,995
Here's a guy you all need to study.

256
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,899
He's an Austrian school economist

257
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,110
who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna.

258
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,955
What was interesting about the Austrian school

259
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:23,024
is they actually grew up alongside Freud.

260
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,700
And so they're predominantly interested in psychology.

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,820
They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology,

262
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,903
which is a prior discipline to the study of economics.

263
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:37,680
Praxeology is the study of human choice, action and decision making.

264
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,232
I think they're right.

265
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,316
I think the danger we have in today's world

266
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:43,185
is we have the study of economics

267
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:47,643
considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology.

268
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,408
But as Charlie Munger says, "If economics isn't behavioral,

269
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,653
I don't know what the hell is."

270
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:59,191
Von Mises, interestingly, believes economics is just a subset of psychology.

271
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:01,015
I think he just refers to economics as

272
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:04,422
"the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity."

273
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,485
But von Mises, among many other things,

274
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:13,453
I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation

275
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,633
for the value of marketing, the value of perceived value

276
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:20,722
and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent

277
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,345
to any other kind of value.

278
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,879
We tend to, all of us -- even those of us who work in marketing --

279
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,395
to think of value in two ways.

280
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:27,547
There's the real value,

281
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,407
which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service,

282
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,570
and then there's a kind of dubious value,

283
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,091
which you create by changing the way people look at things.

284
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:37,037
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction.

285
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,753
And he used this following analogy.

286
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:43,968
He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats,

287
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:48,295
who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land.

288
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:50,891
So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer,

289
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,656
you created true value.

290
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:55,124
If however, you bought some wool from the shepherd

291
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,278
and charged a premium for converting it into a hat,

292
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,612
you weren't actually creating value,

293
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:02,579
you were exploiting the shepherd.

294
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,445
Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake

295
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,597
with regard to advertising and marketing.

296
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,987
He says, if you run a restaurant,

297
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:13,195
there is no healthy distinction to be made

298
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,653
between the value you create by cooking the food

299
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,820
and the value you create by sweeping the floor.

300
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,032
One of them creates, perhaps, the primary product --

301
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,501
the thing we think we're paying for --

302
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,155
the other one creates a context

303
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,472
within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product.

304
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:30,487
And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other

305
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,653
is fundamentally wrong.

306
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:33,913
Try this quick thought experiment.

307
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:36,520
Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food,

308
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,178
but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage

309
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:43,254
and there's human feces on the floor.

310
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:45,554
The best thing you can do there to create value

311
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,745
is not actually to improve the food still further,

312
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:52,739
it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor.

313
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:55,918
And it's vital we understand this.

314
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,141
If that seems like some strange, abstruse thing,

315
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:02,607
in the U.K., the post office had a 98 percent success rate

316
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:04,945
at delivering first-class mail the next day.

317
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:07,312
They decided this wasn't good enough

318
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:09,274
and they wanted to get it up to 99.

319
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:13,588
The effort to do that almost broke the organization.

320
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:16,653
If at the same time you'd gone and asked people,

321
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:19,945
"What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day?"

322
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,450
the average answer, or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent.

323
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,053
Now if your perception is much worse than your reality,

324
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,553
what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality?

325
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:34,755
That's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks.

326
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,820
What you need to do

327
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,480
is first of all tell people

328
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,655
that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day, first-class mail.

329
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,362
That's pretty good.

330
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,987
I would argue, in Britain there's a much better frame of reference,

331
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,585
which is to tell people

332
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,610
that more first-class mail arrives the next day

333
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,668
in the U.K. than in Germany.

334
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:55,195
Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something,

335
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:57,591
just tell us we do it better than the Germans.

336
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,166
(Laughter)

337
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,441
(Applause)

338
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:06,070
Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value

339
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,943
and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed.

340
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:11,049
It has to be said of the Germans

341
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,016
that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job

342
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,147
of creating a united Europe.

343
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,585
The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe

344
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:20,265
through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans.

345
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,970
But I'm British, that's the way we like it.

346
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,653
What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky.

347
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,986
We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food

348
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:33,472
and the environment in which we consume it.

349
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,301
All of you will have seen this phenomenon

350
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,728
if you have your car washed or valeted.

351
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:41,153
When you drive away, your car feels as if it drives better.

352
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,331
And the reason for this,

353
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:46,112
unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil

354
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:49,362
and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of,

355
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,778
is because perception is in any case leaky.

356
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:55,903
Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain

357
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,070
than analgesics that are not branded.

358
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,378
I don't just mean through reported pain reduction,

359
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,376
actual measured pain reduction.

360
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:06,887
And so perception actually is leaky in any case.

361
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:10,441
So if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect,

362
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:12,218
you can damage the other.

363
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,825
Thank you very much.

364
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,679
