1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Imagine if you could record your life --

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
everything you said, everything you did,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
so you could go back

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
and find memorable moments and relive them,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
or sift through traces of time

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
and discover patterns in your own life

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
that previously had gone undiscovered.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
Well that's exactly the journey

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
that my family began

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
five and a half years ago.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
And on this day, at this moment,

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
we walked into the house with our first child,

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
our beautiful baby boy.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
And we walked into a house

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
with a very special home video recording system.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
(Video) Man: Okay.

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Deb Roy: This moment

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
and thousands of other moments special for us

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
were captured in our home

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
because in every room in the house,

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and if you looked down,

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Here's our living room,

27
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
the baby bedroom,

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
kitchen, dining room

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
and the rest of the house.

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
And all of these fed into a disc array

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
that was designed for a continuous capture.

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
So here we are flying through a day in our home

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
as we move from sunlit morning

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
through incandescent evening

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and, finally, lights out for the day.

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Over the course of three years,

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
we recorded eight to 10 hours a day,

38
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
amassing roughly a quarter-million hours

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
of multi-track audio and video.

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
So you're looking at a piece of what is by far

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
the largest home video collection ever made.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
(Laughter)

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
And what this data represents

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
for our family at a personal level,

45
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
the impact has already been immense,

46
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
and we're still learning its value.

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
Countless moments

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
are captured there,

50
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
which was to use this natural longitudinal data

53
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
to understand the process

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
of how a child learns language --

55
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
that child being my son.

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,820
And so with many privacy provisions put in place

57
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
to protect everyone who was recorded in the data,

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
we made elements of the data available

59
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
to my trusted research team at MIT

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
so we could start teasing apart patterns

61
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
in this massive data set,

62
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
trying to understand the influence of social environments

63
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
on language acquisition.

64
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
So we're looking here

65
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
at one of the first things we started to do.

66
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,820
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
and as we move through space and through time,

68
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
In order to convert

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
this opaque, 90,000 hours of video

71
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
into something that we could start to see,

72
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
we use motion analysis to pull out,

73
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
as we move through space and through time,

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
what we call space-time worms.

75
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
And this has become part of our toolkit

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
for being able to look and see

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
where the activities are in the data,

78
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,

79
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
where my son moved throughout the home,

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
so that we could focus our transcription efforts,

81
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
all of the speech environment around my son --

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and over time, the words he began to produce.

84
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
So with that technology and that data

85
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
and the ability to, with machine assistance,

86
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
transcribe speech,

87
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
we've now transcribed

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
well over seven million words of our home transcripts.

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
And with that, let me take you now

90
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
for a first tour into the data.

91
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
So you've all, I'm sure,

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
seen time-lapse videos

93
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
I'd like you to now experience

95
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
the blossoming of a speech form.

96
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
My son, soon after his first birthday,

97
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
would say "gaga" to mean water.

98
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
And over the course of the next half-year,

99
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
he slowly learned to approximate

100
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
the proper adult form, "water."

101
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
So we're going to cruise through half a year

102
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
in about 40 seconds.

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
No video here,

104
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,

105
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
of a new kind of trajectory:

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
gaga to water.

107
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:04,820
(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga

108
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Gaga gaga gaga

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,820
guga guga guga

110
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,820
wada gaga gaga guga gaga

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
wader guga guga

112
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
water water water

113
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,820
water water water

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,820
water water

115
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
water.

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.

117
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:46,820
(Applause)

118
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
So he didn't just learn water.

119
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Over the course of the 24 months,

120
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
the first two years that we really focused on,

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,820
this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.

122
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
And because we have full transcripts,

123
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
we've identified each of the 503 words

124
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
that he learned to produce by his second birthday.

125
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
He was an early talker.

126
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
And so we started to analyze why.

127
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Why were certain words born before others?

128
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
This is one of the first results

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
that came out of our study a little over a year ago

130
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
that really surprised us.

131
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
The way to interpret this apparently simple graph

132
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
is, on the vertical is an indication

133
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
of how complex caregiver utterances are

134
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
based on the length of utterances.

135
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
And the [horizontal] axis is time.

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
And all of the data,

137
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
we aligned based on the following idea:

138
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Every time my son would learn a word,

139
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard

140
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
that contained that word.

141
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances.

142
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
And what we found was this curious phenomena,

143
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,

144
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
making language as simple as possible,

145
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
and then slowly ascend back up in complexity.

146
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And the amazing thing was

147
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
that bounce, that dip,

148
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
lined up almost precisely

149
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
with when each word was born --

150
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
word after word, systematically.

151
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
So it appears that all three primary caregivers --

152
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
myself, my wife and our nanny --

153
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously

154
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
restructuring our language

155
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
to meet him at the birth of a word

156
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,820
and bring him gently into more complex language.

157
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
And the implications of this -- there are many,

158
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
but one I just want to point out,

159
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
is that there must be amazing feedback loops.

160
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Of course, my son is learning

161
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
from his linguistic environment,

162
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
but the environment is learning from him.

163
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops

164
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
and creating a kind of scaffolding

165
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
that has not been noticed until now.

166
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
But that's looking at the speech context.

167
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
What about the visual context?

168
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
We're not looking at --

169
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.

170
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,

171
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
and we've done some optical correction,

172
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,820
and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.

173
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
So welcome to my home.

174
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
This is a moment,

175
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
one moment captured across multiple cameras.

176
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,

177
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
where you can go back and interactively fly around

178
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and then breathe video-life into this system.

179
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
What I'm going to do

180
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,

181
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
again, of just life in the living room.

182
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
That's me and my son on the floor.

183
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And there's video analytics

184
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
that are tracking our movements.

185
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
We're now on the couch,

187
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
looking out through the window at cars passing by.

188
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.

189
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes,

190
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
we turn time into the vertical axis,

191
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
and we open up for a view

192
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
of these interaction traces we've just left behind.

193
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
And we see these amazing structures --

194
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
these little knots of two colors of thread

195
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
we call "social hot spots."

196
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
The spiral thread

197
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
we call a "solo hot spot."

198
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
And we think that these affect the way language is learned.

199
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
What we'd like to do

200
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
is start understanding

201
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
the interaction between these patterns

202
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
and the language that my son is exposed to

203
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
to see if we can predict

204
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
how the structure of when words are heard

205
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
affects when they're learned --

206
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
so in other words, the relationship

207
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,820
between words and what they're about in the world.

208
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
So here's how we're approaching this.

209
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
In this video,

210
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
again, my son is being traced out.

211
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
He's leaving red ink behind.

212
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
And there's our nanny by the door.

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.)

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)

215
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
DR: She offers water,

216
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
and off go the two worms

217
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
over to the kitchen to get water.

218
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
And what we've done is use the word "water"

219
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
to tag that moment, that bit of activity.

220
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
And now we take the power of data

221
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
and take every time my son

222
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
ever heard the word water

223
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
and the context he saw it in,

224
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
and we use it to penetrate through the video

225
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
and find every activity trace

226
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
that co-occurred with an instance of water.

227
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
And what this data leaves in its wake

228
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
is a landscape.

229
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
We call these wordscapes.

230
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
This is the wordscape for the word water,

231
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.

232
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
That's where those big peaks are over to the left.

233
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word.

234
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
We can take the word "bye"

235
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
as in "good bye."

236
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.

237
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
And we look, and we find, as you would expect,

238
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
a contrast in the landscape

239
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.

240
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
So we're using these structures

241
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
to start predicting

242
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
the order of language acquisition,

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and that's ongoing work now.

244
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT --

245
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
this is at the media lab.

246
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
This has become my favorite way

247
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
of videographing just about any space.

248
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Three of the key people in this project,

249
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.

250
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Philip has been a close collaborator

251
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
on all the visualizations you're seeing.

252
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
And Michael Fleischman

253
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
was another Ph.D. student in my lab

254
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
who worked with me on this home video analysis,

255
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
and he made the following observation:

256
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
that "just the way that we're analyzing

257
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
how language connects to events

258
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
which provide common ground for language,

259
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,820
that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,

260
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
and we can apply it to the world of public media."

261
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
And so our effort took an unexpected turn.

262
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Think of mass media

263
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
as providing common ground

264
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
and you have the recipe

265
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
for taking this idea to a whole new place.

266
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
We've started analyzing television content

267
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
using the same principles --

268
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
analyzing event structure of a TV signal --

269
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
episodes of shows,

270
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
commercials,

271
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
all of the components that make up the event structure.

272
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing

273
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.

274
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones

275
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
to get people's conversations,

276
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
you just tune into publicly available social media feeds.

277
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
So we're pulling in

278
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
about three billion comments a month,

279
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
and then the magic happens.

280
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
You have the event structure,

281
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
the common ground that the words are about,

282
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
coming out of the television feeds;

283
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
you've got the conversations

284
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
that are about those topics;

285
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
and through semantic analysis --

286
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
and this is actually real data you're looking at

287
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
from our data processing --

288
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
each yellow line is showing a link being made

289
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
between a comment in the wild

290
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.

291
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
And the same idea now

292
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
can be built up.

293
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
And we get this wordscape,

294
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
except now words are not assembled in my living room.

295
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Instead, the context, the common ground activities,

296
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
are the content on television that's driving the conversations.

297
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,

298
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
are commentary

299
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
that are linked to content on television.

300
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Same concept,

301
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
but looking at communication dynamics

302
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
in a very different sphere.

303
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example,

304
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
measuring content based on how many people are watching,

305
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
this gives us the basic data

306
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
for looking at engagement properties of content.

307
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
And just like we can look at feedback cycles

308
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
and dynamics in a family,

309
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
we can now open up the same concepts

310
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
and look at much larger groups of people.

311
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
This is a subset of data from our database --

312
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
just 50,000 out of several million --

313
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
and the social graph that connects them

314
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
through publicly available sources.

315
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
And if you put them on one plain,

316
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
a second plain is where the content lives.

317
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
So we have the programs

318
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
and the sporting events

319
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
and the commercials,

320
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
and all of the link structures that tie them together

321
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
make a content graph.

322
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And then the important third dimension.

323
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here

324
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
is an actual connection made

325
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
between something someone said

326
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and a piece of content.

327
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
that give us the connective tissue of social graphs

329
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
and how they relate to content.

330
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
And we can now start to probe the structure

331
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
in interesting ways.

332
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
So if we, for example, trace the path

333
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
of one piece of content

334
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
that drives someone to comment on it,

335
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
and then we follow where that comment goes,

336
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated

337
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
and then trace back to see the relationship

338
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
between that social graph and content,

339
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
a very interesting structure becomes visible.

340
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
We call this a co-viewing clique,

341
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
a virtual living room if you will.

342
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
And there are fascinating dynamics at play.

343
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
It's not one way.

344
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.

345
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
They talk to other people.

346
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,

347
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
and you have these cycles

348
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
that drive the overall behavior.

349
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
Another example -- very different --

350
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
another actual person in our database --

351
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.

352
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
We've given this person a name.

353
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic

354
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
who has this high fan-out rate.

355
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential --

356
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.

357
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
So this person is a key link

358
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
in connecting mass media and social media together.

359
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
One last example from this data:

360
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.

361
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
So if we go and look at this piece of content,

362
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
President Obama's State of the Union address

363
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
from just a few weeks ago,

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
and look at what we find in this same data set,

365
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
at the same scale,

366
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
the engagement properties of this piece of content

367
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
are truly remarkable.

368
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
A nation exploding in conversation

369
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
in real time

370
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
in response to what's on the broadcast.

371
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
And of course, through all of these lines

372
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
are flowing unstructured language.

373
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
We can X-ray

374
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
and get a real-time pulse of a nation,

375
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
real-time sense

376
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph

377
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
being activated by content.

378
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
So, to summarize, the idea is this:

379
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
As our world becomes increasingly instrumented

380
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
and we have the capabilities

381
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
to collect and connect the dots

382
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
between what people are saying

383
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
and the context they're saying it in,

384
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
what's emerging is an ability

385
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
to see new social structures and dynamics

386
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
that have previously not been seen.

387
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
It's like building a microscope or telescope

388
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
and revealing new structures

389
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
about our own behavior around communication.

390
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
And I think the implications here are profound,

391
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
whether it's for science,

392
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
for commerce, for government,

393
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
or perhaps most of all,

394
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
for us as individuals.

395
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
And so just to return to my son,

396
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,

397
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,

398
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
and I asked him for permission -- granted.

399
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
And then I went on to reflect,

400
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
"Isn't it amazing,

401
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
this entire database, all these recordings,

402
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" --

403
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
who arrived two years later --

404
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments

405
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,820
that you could never, with your biological memory,

406
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
possibly remember the way you can now?"

407
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
And he was quiet for a moment.

408
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
And I thought, "What am I thinking?

409
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
He's five years old. He's not going to understand this."

410
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,

411
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
"So that when I grow up,

412
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
I can show this to my kids?"

413
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,820
And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."

414
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
So I want to leave you

415
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
with one last memorable moment

416
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
from our family.

417
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
This is the first time our son

418
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
took more than two steps at once --

419
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
captured on film.

420
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
And I really want you to focus on something

421
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
as I take you through.

422
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.

423
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
My mother's in the kitchen, cooking,

424
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
and, of all places, in the hallway,

425
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.

426
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
And so you hear me encouraging him,

427
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
realizing what's happening,

428
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
and then the magic happens.

429
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Listen very carefully.

430
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
About three steps in,

431
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
he realizes something magic is happening,

432
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,

433
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
and he takes a breath in,

434
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
and he whispers "wow"

435
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,820
and instinctively I echo back the same.

436
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
And so let's fly back in time

437
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
to that memorable moment.

438
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
(Video) DR: Hey.

439
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Come here.

440
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Can you do it?

441
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Oh, boy.

442
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Can you do it?

443
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Baby: Yeah.

444
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
DR: Ma, he's walking.

445
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
(Laughter)

446
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
(Applause)

447
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
DR: Thank you.

448
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:41,820
(Applause)
