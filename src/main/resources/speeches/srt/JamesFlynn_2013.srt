1
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,010
We are going to take a quick voyage

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,517
over the cognitive history of the 20th century,

3
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,306
because during that century,

4
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:23,220
our minds have altered dramatically.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,544
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900

6
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,618
have altered because the roads are better

7
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:30,973
and because of technology.

8
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:32,942
And our minds have altered, too.

9
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:36,886
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world

10
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:40,285
and analyzed that world primarily in terms

11
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:42,518
of how much it would benefit them

12
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:47,110
to people who confront a very complex world,

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,319
and it's a world where we've had to develop

14
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,814
new mental habits, new habits of mind.

15
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,811
And these include things like

16
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:58,825
clothing that concrete world with classification,

17
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,747
introducing abstractions that we try to make

18
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,943
logically consistent,

19
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:06,773
and also taking the hypothetical seriously,

20
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,023
that is, wondering about what might have been

21
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,415
rather than what is.

22
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:14,967
Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention

23
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,727
through massive I.Q. gains over time,

24
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,096
and these have been truly massive.

25
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:25,507
That is, we don't just get a few more questions right

26
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,980
on I.Q. tests.

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,439
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests

28
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,687
than each succeeding generation

29
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,597
back to the time that they were invented.

30
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,895
Indeed, if you score the people a century ago

31
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,443
against modern norms,

32
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:43,814
they would have an average I.Q. of 70.

33
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:46,539
If you score us against their norms,

34
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,138
we would have an average I.Q. of 130.

35
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:53,495
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.

36
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:55,400
Were our immediate ancestors

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,635
on the verge of mental retardation?

38
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:02,710
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.

39
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,742
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?

40
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:09,978
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.

41
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,098
Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative

42
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:17,151
that's much more illuminating than either of those,

43
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,773
and to put this into perspective,

44
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,678
let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth

45
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,513
and found a ruined civilization.

46
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,920
And this Martian was an archaeologist,

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,807
and they found scores, target scores,

48
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,730
that people had used for shooting.

49
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,233
And first they looked at 1865,

50
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,304
and they found that in a minute,

51
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:42,013
people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.

52
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:44,330
And then they found, in 1898,

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,114
that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.

54
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:53,341
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.

55
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,196
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.

56
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,793
They would say, look, these tests were designed

57
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:03,391
to find out how much people were steady of hand,

58
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,166
how keen their eyesight was,

59
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,504
whether they had control of their weapon.

60
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:11,525
How could these performances have escalated

61
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,707
to this enormous degree?

62
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,982
Well we now know, of course, the answer.

63
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,794
If that Martian looked at battlefields,

64
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:21,618
they would find that people had only muskets

65
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,682
at the time of the Civil War

66
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,489
and that they had repeating rifles

67
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,674
at the time of the Spanish-American War,

68
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,410
and then they had machine guns

69
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,225
by the time of World War I.

70
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,776
And, in other words, it was the equipment

71
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:37,943
that was in the hands of the average soldier

72
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:41,006
that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye

73
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,179
or steadiness of hand.

74
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:46,499
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery

75
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,992
that we have picked up over those hundred years,

76
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:54,055
and I think again that another thinker will help us here,

77
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:56,190
and that's Luria.

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,334
Luria looked at people

79
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:01,987
just before they entered the scientific age,

80
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,984
and he found that these people

81
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:07,641
were resistant to classifying the concrete world.

82
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:08,695
They wanted to break it up

83
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,285
into little bits that they could use.

84
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,575
He found that they were resistant

85
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:17,076
to deducing the hypothetical,

86
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,753
to speculating about what might be,

87
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,390
and he found finally that they didn't deal well

88
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,787
with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.

89
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,927
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.

90
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:32,293
He talked to the head man of a person

91
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,125
in rural Russia.

92
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,599
They'd only had, as people had in 1900,

93
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,780
about four years of schooling.

94
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,140
And he asked that particular person,

95
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,610
what do crows and fish have in common?

96
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,677
And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.

97
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:50,670
You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.

98
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,996
A crow can peck at a fish.

99
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,847
A fish can't do anything to a crow."

100
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:59,073
And Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"

101
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:00,483
And he said, "Of course not.

102
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,470
One's a fish.

103
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,242
The other is a bird."

104
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,264
And he was interested, effectively,

105
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,932
in what he could do with those concrete objects.

106
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,810
And then Luria went to another person,

107
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,993
and he said to them,

108
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:17,689
"There are no camels in Germany.

109
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:20,100
Hamburg is a city in Germany.

110
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,643
Are there camels in Hamburg?"

111
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:23,534
And the fellow said,

112
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:27,753
"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."

113
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:31,647
And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"

114
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,924
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,

115
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:36,493
and there's no room for camels."

116
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,756
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this

117
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,553
as anything but a concrete problem,

118
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,111
and he was used to camels being in villages,

119
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,044
and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,

120
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:52,951
to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.

121
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:55,764
A third interview was conducted

122
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,748
with someone about the North Pole.

123
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:02,853
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.

124
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:06,808
Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.

125
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:10,087
What color are the bears at the North Pole?"

126
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,489
And the response was, "Such a thing

127
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,799
is to be settled by testimony.

128
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,623
If a wise person came from the North Pole

129
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:19,474
and told me the bears were white,

130
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:20,953
I might believe him,

131
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:25,158
but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."

132
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,142
Now you see again, this person has rejected

133
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,337
going beyond the concrete world

134
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:33,510
and analyzing it through everyday experience,

135
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,376
and it was important to that person

136
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,938
what color bears were --

137
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,219
that is, they had to hunt bears.

138
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:41,628
They weren't willing to engage in this.

139
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,465
One of them said to Luria,

140
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:46,965
"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?

141
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:48,856
None of these problems are real.

142
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,499
How can we address them?"

143
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,044
Now, these three categories --

144
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:56,535
classification,

145
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,676
using logic on abstractions,

146
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:01,445
taking the hypothetical seriously --

147
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,883
how much difference do they make in the real world

148
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,776
beyond the testing room?

149
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,746
And let me give you a few illustrations.

150
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:12,135
First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.

151
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:15,532
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education

152
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:18,309
to 12 years of formal education,

153
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,210
and 52 percent of Americans

154
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,030
have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.

155
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,062
Now, not only do we have much more education,

156
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,755
and much of that education is scientific,

157
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:34,765
and you can't do science without classifying the world.

158
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:38,624
You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.

159
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,798
You can't do science without making it logically consistent.

160
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:46,608
And even down in grade school, things have changed.

161
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,542
In 1910, they looked at the examinations

162
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,362
that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,

163
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,968
and they found that they were all

164
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,403
for socially valued concrete information.

165
00:07:58,403 --> 00:07:59,734
They were things like,

166
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:02,621
what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states

167
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,995
that existed at that time?

168
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,573
When they looked at the exams

169
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,720
that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,

170
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,106
they were all about abstractions.

171
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,699
They were things like,

172
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:18,833
why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?

173
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,397
And you were supposed to think, well,

174
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:23,611
the state legislature was rural-controlled,

175
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,709
and they hated the big city,

176
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,302
so rather than putting the capital in a big city,

177
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:29,740
they put it in a county seat.

178
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,476
They put it in Albany rather than New York.

179
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:35,532
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.

180
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,467
And so forth.

181
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,898
So the tenor of education has changed.

182
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:43,932
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,

183
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:47,510
to use abstractions, and to link them logically.

184
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,891
What about employment?

185
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:53,791
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans

186
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,333
practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.

187
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,388
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.

188
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,251
Today, 35 percent of Americans

189
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:07,570
practice cognitively demanding professions,

190
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,196
not only to the professions proper like lawyer

191
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,745
or doctor or scientist or lecturer,

192
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,563
but many, many sub-professions

193
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,504
having to do with being a technician,

194
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,529
a computer programmer.

195
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:22,853
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.

196
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,783
And we can only meet the terms of employment

197
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:28,280
in the modern world by being cognitively

198
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,541
far more flexible.

199
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,764
And it's not just that we have many more people

200
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,754
in cognitively demanding professions.

201
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:39,157
The professions have been upgraded.

202
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:41,268
Compare the doctor in 1900,

203
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,317
who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,

204
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,125
with the modern general practitioner or specialist,

205
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,804
with years of scientific training.

206
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:52,073
Compare the banker in 1900,

207
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:54,486
who really just needed a good accountant

208
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:57,662
and to know who was trustworthy in the local community

209
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,953
for paying back their mortgage.

210
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:03,182
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees

211
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:04,948
may have been morally remiss,

212
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:08,087
but they were cognitively very agile.

213
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:12,698
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.

214
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:14,865
They had to look at computer projections

215
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,865
for the housing market.

216
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:20,770
They had to get complicated CDO-squared

217
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,220
in order to bundle debt together

218
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,979
and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.

219
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:30,079
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies

220
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,190
to give it a AAA,

221
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,424
though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.

222
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:37,453
And they also, of course, had to get people

223
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,140
to accept these so-called assets

224
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,640
and pay money for them

225
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,227
even though they were highly vulnerable.

226
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,817
Or take a farmer today.

227
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,097
I take the farm manager of today as very different

228
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,588
from the farmer of 1900.

229
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,426
So it hasn't just been the spread

230
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:56,617
of cognitively demanding professions.

231
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,997
It's also been the upgrading of tasks

232
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,564
like lawyer and doctor and what have you

233
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:05,341
that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.

234
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,500
But I've talked about education and employment.

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,839
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed

236
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,446
over the 20th century

237
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:16,041
have paid off in unexpected areas.

238
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,312
I'm primarily a moral philosopher.

239
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:22,000
I merely have a holiday in psychology,

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,408
and what interests me in general is moral debate.

241
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,139
Now over the last century,

242
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,489
in developed nations like America,

243
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,470
moral debate has escalated

244
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,809
because we take the hypothetical seriously,

245
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,024
and we also take universals seriously

246
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,820
and look for logical connections.

247
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,555
When I came home in 1955 from university

248
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,862
at the time of Martin Luther King,

249
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,184
a lot of people came home at that time

250
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:54,934
and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.

251
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:58,162
My father was born in 1885,

252
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,725
and he was mildly racially biased.

253
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,828
As an Irishman, he hated the English so much

254
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:05,149
he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.

255
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,420
(Laughter)

256
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,928
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.

257
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:15,776
And when we said to our parents and grandparents,

258
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,269
"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"

259
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,890
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

260
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,392
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --

261
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,794
(Laughter) --

262
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,024
that turned black?

263
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:33,540
In other words, they were fixed in the concrete

264
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,053
mores and attitudes they had inherited.

265
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:40,064
They would not take the hypothetical seriously,

266
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:41,548
and without the hypothetical,

267
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:45,567
it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.

268
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,202
You have to say, imagine you were

269
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:53,787
in Iran, and imagine that your relatives

270
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:56,487
all suffered from collateral damage

271
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:58,433
even though they had done no wrong.

272
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,494
How would you feel about that?

273
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,214
And if someone of the older generation says,

274
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,144
well, our government takes care of us,

275
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:08,087
and it's up to their government to take care of them,

276
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,155
they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.

277
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:15,522
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,

278
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:18,732
and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.

279
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,092
Well, he's treating his mores

280
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,992
as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,

281
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,637
and they're unmovable in any way by logic.

282
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:30,213
They're just inherited mores.

283
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:32,414
Today we would say something like,

284
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:35,991
well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.

285
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,664
Would you deserve to be killed?

286
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:40,559
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.

287
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,581
That's not one of the principles I've got.

288
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,422
Well you, today, universalize your principles.

289
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:50,979
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.

290
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,252
If you have a principle such as,

291
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,898
people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,

292
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,994
then to exclude black people

293
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,492
you've got to make exceptions, don't you?

294
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:04,480
You have to say, well, blackness of skin,

295
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,103
you couldn't suffer just for that.

296
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,366
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.

297
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,533
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,

298
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:16,449
and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted

299
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,243
when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.

300
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:23,668
And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,

301
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:28,222
because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.

302
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:30,159
You're treating them as universals,

303
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,938
to be rendered consistent by logic.

304
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,068
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?

305
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:40,078
That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.

306
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,963
If you look at the I.Q. test,

307
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,948
you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.

308
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:48,551
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler

309
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,820
is about classification,

310
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,900
and we have made enormous gains

311
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,010
on that classification subtest.

312
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,291
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery

313
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,387
that are about using logic on abstractions.

314
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:05,861
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,

315
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,399
and it's all about analogies.

316
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,255
And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.

317
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:16,600
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.

318
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,176
What are dogs like?

319
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:20,268
They would say wolves.

320
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:23,812
But by 1960, people could attack Raven's

321
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:26,462
on a much more sophisticated level.

322
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:30,969
If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,

323
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:33,205
what follows two circles?

324
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,492
They could say a semicircle.

325
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:37,670
Just as a triangle is half of a square,

326
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,388
a semicircle is half of a circle.

327
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:43,981
By 2010, college graduates, if you said

328
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:47,216
two circles followed by a semicircle,

329
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,006
two sixteens followed by what,

330
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:53,742
they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.

331
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:56,608
That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world

332
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,901
that they could even ignore

333
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:03,424
the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.

334
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,588
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.

335
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:09,460
We haven't made progress on all fronts.

336
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,224
One of the ways in which we would like to deal

337
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:14,422
with the sophistication of the modern world

338
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,458
is through politics,

339
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,793
and sadly you can have humane moral principles,

340
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:24,213
you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,

341
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:27,143
and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,

342
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:29,570
you can't do politics.

343
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,590
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,

344
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,465
that they read less history and less literature

345
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:38,075
and less material about foreign lands,

346
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,770
and they're essentially ahistorical.

347
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,887
They live in the bubble of the present.

348
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:44,743
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.

349
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:48,926
They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.

350
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,547
Think how different America would be

351
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:55,143
if every American knew that this is the fifth time

352
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:59,237
Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,

353
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:02,601
and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened

354
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,926
on those four previous occasions.

355
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:05,876
(Laughter)

356
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:07,824
And that is, they had barely left,

357
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,156
and there wasn't a trace in the sand.

358
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:13,364
Or imagine how different things would be

359
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:16,120
if most Americans knew that we had been lied

360
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,045
into four of our last six wars.

361
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,979
You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,

362
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:24,237
the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel

363
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:26,870
but was loaded with munitions,

364
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,948
the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,

365
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:34,516
and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda

366
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,425
and had nothing to do with it,

367
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:40,228
and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people

368
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:41,772
that they were brothers in arms,

369
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:45,651
when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.

370
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:49,120
But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.

371
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,638
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves

372
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,291
in ordinary people that we have now realized,

373
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,355
and the aristocracy was convinced

374
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,534
that the average person couldn't make it,

375
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,500
that they could never share their mindset

376
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,106
or their cognitive abilities.

377
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,820
Lord Curzon once said

378
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,084
he saw people bathing in the North Sea,

379
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,747
and he said, "Why did no one tell me

380
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:15,723
what white bodies the lower orders have?"

381
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:18,074
As if they were a reptile.

382
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:21,124
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]

383
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:24,834
[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady

384
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,043
are sisters underneath the skin."

385
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:32,043
(Applause)
