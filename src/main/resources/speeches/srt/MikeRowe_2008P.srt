1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
And the job in question was sheep rancher.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,820
My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,820
I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people,

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
for one day in their life.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
The job in question: herding sheep. Great.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and I realize the next day that castration

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
is going to be an absolute part of this work.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,820
So, normally, I never do any research at all.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,820
and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do,

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
So I called the Humane Society

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and I say, "Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Can you tell me the deal?"

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
And they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,820
They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,820
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday,

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
but it had a certain familiarity to it.

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
And they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,820
And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Blood flow is slowly retarded;

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
a week later the parts in question fall off.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
"Great -- got it."

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
OK, that's basically how you do it.

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
So the next day I go out.

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
and we take them to a pen that we built,

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,820
and we go about the business of animal husbandry.

38
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Melanie is the wife of Albert.

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
Albert is the shepherd in question.

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands --

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.

43
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Alright. Great.

44
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.

45
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,820
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Being an apprentice, you know, you do that.

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
but what comes out instead is a knife.

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun

51
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very --

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
it was, it was impressive.

53
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,820
between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb,

55
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.

56
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger,

57
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.

58
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
And he pulled it toward him, like so,

59
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,820
and then his head dips down, obscuring my view,

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
but what I hear is a slurping sound,

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,820
and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and I am not even kidding.

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Can we roll the video?

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
No I'm kidding -- we don't --

69
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
(Laughter)

70
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
I thought it best to talk in pictures.

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,820
So, I do something now I've never ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.

72
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
I say, "Time out. Stop."

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two.

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.

75
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --

76
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
we shoot what we get!

77
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
I said, "Stop. This is nuts."

78
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
I mean, you know.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
(Laughter)

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
"This is crazy.

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
We can't do this."

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And Albert's like, "What?"

83
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And I'm like, "I don't know what just happened,

84
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."

85
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
And he said "Well, that's how we do it."

86
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
And I said, "Why would you do it this way?"

87
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
And before I even let him explain,

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
I said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."

89
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And he says, "Like the Humane Society?"

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
And I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.

91
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed --

92
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
we're on in five continents, dude.

93
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
He says, "OK."

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.

96
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,

97
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
gets up, shakes a little,

100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
takes another couple steps, falls down.

101
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.

102
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering,

103
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.

104
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,820
And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
When does he get up?"

106
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
He's like, "A day."

107
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
"A week."

109
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on

110
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,820
is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,820
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.

112
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
And I was just so blown away

113
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,820
at how wrong I was, in that second.

114
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,820
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.

115
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,820
(Laughter)

116
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,820
And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day

117
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
because now I had to do what Albert had just done,

118
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen,

119
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,820
and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,

120
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
and I'm like ... (Laughter)

121
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
Melanie picks up the lamb,

122
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
puts it on the post, opens it up.

123
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Albert hands me the knife.

124
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
I go in, tail comes off.

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.

126
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."

127
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I do.

128
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
"Push it further."

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I do.

130
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you --

131
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
and he says, "Bite 'em.

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Just bite 'em off."

133
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
And I heard him, I heard all the words.

134
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
(Laughter)

135
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Like, how did -- how did I get here?

136
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
How did -- you know -- I mean --

137
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
how did I get here?

138
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
(Laughter)

139
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,820
It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own:

140
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies,

141
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,820
and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.

142
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
You know, Aristotle says a tragedy

143
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,820
is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.

144
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
(Laughter)

145
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
And I'm like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?

146
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
I don't like what I'm thinking right now."

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
And I can't get this thought out of my head,

148
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
and I can't get that vision out of my sight,

149
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
so I did what I had to do.

150
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
I went in and I took them.

151
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
I took them like this,

152
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
and I yanked my face back.

153
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
And I'm standing there

154
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
with two testicles on my chin.

155
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
(Laughter)

156
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.

157
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
OK, I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,

158
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head

159
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,820
that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there.

160
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.

161
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.

162
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.

163
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.

164
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
It's what our network does;

165
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.

166
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.

167
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Great.

168
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
The other word, peripeteia,

169
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,820
that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --

170
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Euripides and Sophocles --

171
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
the moment where Oedipus has his moment,

172
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
where he suddenly realizes that hot chick

173
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK.

174
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
That's peripety

175
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
or peripeteia.

176
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
And this metaphor in my head --

177
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.

178
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
(Laughter)

179
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I got to tell you, it's such a great device though.

180
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
When you start to look for peripetia,

181
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
you find it everywhere.

182
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?

183
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,

184
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and then, boom -- "Oh, I'm dead" -- peripetia.

185
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
You know?

186
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.

187
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Neo in "The Matrix," you know?

188
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
"Oh, I'm living in a computer program" -- that's weird.

189
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations;

190
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time,

191
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,820
but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.

192
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And, as I stood there,

193
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled --

194
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
but it looked OK.

195
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,

196
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
and I just was struck by

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
if I'm wrong about that

198
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,

199
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,820
what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?

200
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist

201
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
but I have a friend who is.

202
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
And I talk to him.

203
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
(Laughter)

204
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
And he says, "Hey Mike.

205
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,

206
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
but do you realize you've shot in every state?

207
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing,

208
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820
you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.

209
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys

210
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"

211
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,

212
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.

213
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,820
I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.

214
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
"And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,

215
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
it might be time to think about it.

216
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Because, dude, you know, four years."

217
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin,

218
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
thoughts are bouncing around.

219
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,820
And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change,

220
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
in terms of what the show is,

221
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
but it changed for me, personally.

222
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And now, when I talk about the show,

223
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,820
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.

224
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,820
I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong,

225
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
some of the other notions of work

226
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,820
that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct,

227
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
and they're not.

228
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.

229
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
As a group, they're the happiest people I know.

230
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
And I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"

231
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and all that happy worker crap.

232
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.

233
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God --

234
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I did it with them.

235
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,820
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.

236
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And I see it over and over and over again.

237
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
So I started to wonder what would happen

238
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
if we challenged some of these sacred cows.

239
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Follow your passion --

240
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.

241
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?

242
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Probably the worst advice I ever got.

243
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
(Laughter)

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?

245
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
I mean, that's all I heard growing up.

246
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I didn't know what to do with my life,

247
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.

248
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
I can give you 30 examples, right now --

249
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas

250
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos

251
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
and feeds them them to his swine.

252
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Why? Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat

253
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,

254
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
and he is one rich pig farmer,

255
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
and he is good for the environment,

256
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
and he spends his days doing this incredible service,

257
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
and he smells like hell, but God bless him.

258
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
He's making a great living.

259
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
You ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"

260
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and he'd laugh at you.

261
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,820
The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm

262
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
and turned it down, outside of Vegas.

263
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
He didn't follow his passion.

264
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going

265
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
and he went the other way.

266
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
And I hear that story over and over.

267
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,

268
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows

269
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
was worth more than their milk,

270
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots.

271
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Now, he's selling them to Walmart.

272
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.

273
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
So I started to look at passion,

274
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,820
I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness --

275
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.

276
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I started to look at teamwork and determination,

277
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
and basically all those platitudes they call "successories"

278
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now.

279
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
That stuff --

280
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
it's suddenly all been turned on its head.

281
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Safety -- safety first?

282
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:

283
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
what if OSHA got it wrong?

284
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say --

285
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
but what if it's really safety third?

286
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Right?

287
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
(Laughter)

288
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
No, I mean really.

289
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs

290
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
as much as the people that I'm working with,

291
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
but the ones who really get it done,

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
they're not out there talking about safety first.

293
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
They know that other things come first --

294
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
the business of doing the work comes first,

295
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
the business of getting it done.

296
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat

297
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,820
with the "Deadliest Catch" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season.

298
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:

299
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?

300
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,

301
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.

302
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
So, I'm 40 feet off the deck,

303
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
which is like looking down at the top of your shoe,

304
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
you know, and it's doing this in the ocean.

305
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Unspeakably dangerous.

306
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse

307
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
and I say, with some level of incredulity,

308
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
"Captain, OSHA."

309
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."

310
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
And he points out there.

311
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
(Laughter)

312
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,820
But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48.

313
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.

314
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
But he looked at me, and he said, "Son" --

315
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that --

316
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
he says, "Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat.

317
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.

318
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
My responsibility is to get you home rich."

319
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
(Laughter)

320
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
You want to get home alive, that's on you.

321
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
And for the rest of that day, safety first.

322
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I was like --

323
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
So, the idea that we create this false --

324
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
this sense of complacency

325
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,820
when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility

326
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
as though it's our own, and vice versa.

327
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Anyhow, a whole lot of things.

328
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made

329
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.

330
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
But, what it all comes down to is this.

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now

332
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.

333
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
It goes like this --

334
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
we've declared war on work,

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
as a society, all of us.

336
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
It's a civil war.

337
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
It's a cold war, really.

338
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
We didn't set out to do it

339
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,

340
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
but we've done it.

341
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And we've waged this war on at least four fronts,

342
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
certainly in Hollywood.

343
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
The way we portray working people on TV --

344
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
it's laughable.

345
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,820
If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it.

346
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
You see him all the time.

347
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
That's what plumbers look like, right?

348
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.

349
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
That's what TV does.

350
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
We try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,

351
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
which is why I do the work and I don't cheat.

352
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,820
But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.

353
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there --

354
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
in the way of a message, what's really being said?

355
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Your life would be better if you could work a little less,

356
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier,

357
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner --

358
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
it's all in there, over and over, again and again.

359
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Washington? I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place

360
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,820
that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs

361
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
because I don't really know.

362
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I just know that that's a front in this war.

363
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
And right here guys, Silicon Valley,

364
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?

365
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
How many people have their Blackberries?

366
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
We're plugged in; we're connected.

367
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
I would never suggest for a second

368
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.

369
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Good grief, not to this crowd.

370
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
(Laughter)

371
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,820
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation

372
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
is a complete waste of time.

373
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
And nobody celebrates imitation

374
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
the way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.

375
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Your iPhone without those people making the same interface,

376
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?

377
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
All of that? That's what makes it equally as possible

378
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
as the genius that goes inside of it.

379
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
So, we've got this new toolbox, you know.

380
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.

381
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
They look like the stuff we walk around with.

382
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,820
And so the collective effect of all of that

383
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,820
has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.

384
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,820
And I realized, probably too late in this game --

385
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things --

386
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
but we're going to do as many as we can.

387
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
And to me the most important thing to know

388
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
and to really come face to face with,

389
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,

390
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
not just the testicles on my chin.

391
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
I got a lot wrong.

392
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,820
So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me --

393
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,820
that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work,

394
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
manual labor, skilled labor.

395
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Somebody needs to be out there

396
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
talking about the forgotten benefits.

397
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I'm talking about grandfather stuff,

398
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
the stuff a lot us probably grew up with

399
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost

400
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
a little.

401
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.

402
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
The infrastructure is a huge deal.

403
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties

404
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
like any other war.

405
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
The infrastructure's the first one;

406
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.

407
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Every single year: fewer electricians,

408
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,

409
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
fewer welders, fewer pipefitters,

410
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
fewer steamfitters.

411
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,820
The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating

412
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
are those guys --

413
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
the ones that have been in decline, over and over.

414
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum,

415
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
according to the American Society of Civil Engineers --

416
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,

417
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
which is currently rated at a D minus.

418
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,820
So, if I were running for anything, and I'm not,

419
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,820
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make

420
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
and the jobs we hope to create

421
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.

422
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
And I know the point of this conference

423
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,820
is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,

424
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,820
but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.

425
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
They're two sides of the same coin,

426
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
just like innovation and imitation,

427
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
like risk and responsibility,

428
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
like peripetia and anagnorisis,

429
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,820
like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,

430
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
and like my time that's gone.

431
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
It's been great talking to you

432
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
and get back to work, will you?

433
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
(Applause)
