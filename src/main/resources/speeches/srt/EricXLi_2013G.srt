1
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:13,888
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,914
My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.

3
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,623
But no, I wasn't born there.

4
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,155
This was where I was born:

5
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:28,128
Shanghai, at the height of the Cultural Revolution.

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,753
My grandmother tells me that she heard

7
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:32,975
the sound of gunfire along with my first cries.

8
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:36,730
When I was growing up, I was told a story

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,335
that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity.

10
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,774
It went like this.

11
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,032
All human societies develop in linear progression,

12
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:48,624
beginning with primitive society, then slave society,

13
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:51,655
feudalism, capitalism, socialism,

14
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:53,999
and finally, guess where we end up?

15
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:57,123
Communism!

16
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,835
Sooner or later, all of humanity,

17
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:03,601
regardless of culture, language, nationality,

18
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,057
will arrive at this final stage

19
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,490
of political and social development.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,746
The entire world's peoples will be unified

21
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:13,010
in this paradise on Earth

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,778
and live happily ever after.

23
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,065
But before we get there, we're engaged

24
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:20,506
in a struggle between good and evil,

25
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,647
the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism,

26
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:25,594
and the good shall triumph.

27
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:28,090
That, of course, was the meta-narrative

28
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,870
distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,472
And the Chinese bought it.

30
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:36,385
We were taught that grand story day in and day out.

31
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:39,158
It became part of us, and we believed in it.

32
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,352
The story was a bestseller.

33
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,432
About one third of the entire world's population

34
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:46,315
lived under that meta-narrative.

35
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,082
Then, the world changed overnight.

36
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:52,728
As for me, disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth,

37
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,641
I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie.

38
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,840
(Laughter)

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,556
Now, as I was coming of age, something else happened.

40
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,752
As if one big story wasn't enough,

41
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,264
I was told another one.

42
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:10,496
This one was just as grand.

43
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,659
It also claims that all human societies

44
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,504
develop in a linear progression towards a singular end.

45
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,029
This one went as follows:

46
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,385
All societies, regardless of culture,

47
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:24,075
be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,

48
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,804
must progress from traditional societies

49
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:29,350
in which groups are the basic units

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,851
to modern societies in which atomized individuals

51
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,314
are the sovereign units,

52
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:38,057
and all these individuals are, by definition, rational,

53
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,123
and they all want one thing:

54
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:42,623
the vote.

55
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:45,283
Because they are all rational, once given the vote,

56
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,717
they produce good government

57
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,916
and live happily ever after.

58
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,835
Paradise on Earth, again.

59
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,936
Sooner or later, electoral democracy will be

60
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:58,947
the only political system for all countries and all peoples,

61
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:01,411
with a free market to make them all rich.

62
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:04,961
But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle

63
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,654
between good and evil.

64
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,214
(Laughter)

65
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,452
The good belongs to those who are democracies

66
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,398
and are charged with a mission of spreading it

67
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:15,860
around the globe, sometimes by force,

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,286
against the evil of those who do not hold elections.

69
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,176
(Video) George H.W. Bush: A new world order ...

70
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,388
(Video) George W. Bush: ... ending tyranny in our world ...

71
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:25,303
(Video) Barack Obama: ... a single standard for all

72
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:28,660
who would hold power.

73
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,464
Eric X. Li: Now --

74
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:38,145
(Laughter) (Applause)

75
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:42,168
This story also became a bestseller.

76
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,035
According to Freedom House,

77
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:47,038
the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970

78
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,573
to 115 in 2010.

79
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,767
In the last 20 years, Western elites tirelessly

80
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,062
trotted around the globe selling this prospectus:

81
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:58,677
Multiple parties fight for political power

82
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,223
and everyone voting on them

83
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,244
is the only path to salvation

84
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:05,011
to the long-suffering developing world.

85
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,123
Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success.

86
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,215
Those who do not are doomed to fail.

87
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,413
But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.

88
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:16,932
Fool me once ...

89
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:21,501
(Laughter)

90
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,803
The rest is history.

91
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,374
In just 30 years, China went from

92
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:27,794
one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world

93
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:29,918
to its second-largest economy.

94
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,974
Six hundred fifty million people

95
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,589
were lifted out of poverty.

96
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,577
Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation

97
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,802
during that period happened in China.

98
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,451
In other words, all the new and old democracies

99
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:44,519
put together amounted to a mere fraction

100
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,788
of what a single, one-party state did without voting.

101
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,966
See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.

102
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,899
Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams

103
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,491
per person per month at one point.

104
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:01,662
Needless to say, I ate all my grandmother's portions.

105
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:05,397
So I asked myself, what's wrong with this picture?

106
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,398
Here I am in my hometown,

107
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:09,042
my business growing leaps and bounds.

108
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,483
Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day.

109
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:14,564
Middle class is expanding in speed and scale

110
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,565
unprecedented in human history.

111
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,102
Yet, according to the grand story,

112
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,037
none of this should be happening.

113
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:25,243
So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it.

114
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:27,250
Yes, China is a one-party state

115
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,135
run by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party,

116
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,087
and they don't hold elections.

117
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,646
Three assumptions are made

118
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:38,300
by the dominant political theories of our time.

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,183
Such a system is operationally rigid,

120
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:44,869
politically closed, and morally illegitimate.

121
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:48,079
Well, the assumptions are wrong.

122
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,289
The opposites are true.

123
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,627
Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy

124
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:55,561
are the three defining characteristics

125
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:57,932
of China's one-party system.

126
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,424
Now, most political scientists will tell us

127
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:03,189
that a one-party system is inherently incapable

128
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,117
of self-correction.

129
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:07,435
It won't last long because it cannot adapt.

130
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,233
Now here are the facts.

131
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,793
In 64 years of running the largest country in the world,

132
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:15,353
the range of the Party's policies has been wider

133
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:18,270
than any other country in recent memory,

134
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,241
from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward,

135
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,893
then privatization of farmland,

136
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:27,189
then the Cultural Revolution,

137
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,885
then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,

138
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:33,298
then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step

139
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:36,446
of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople,

140
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,509
something unimaginable during Mao's rule.

141
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,330
So the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions.

142
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,960
Institutionally, new rules get enacted

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,539
to correct previous dysfunctions.

144
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,413
For example, term limits.

145
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,950
Political leaders used to retain their positions for life,

146
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,758
and they used that to accumulate power

147
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,602
and perpetuate their rules.

148
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:58,822
Mao was the father of modern China,

149
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:01,694
yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes.

150
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:03,854
So the Party instituted term limits

151
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:07,607
with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.

152
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,856
One thing we often hear is,

153
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:13,034
"Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms,"

154
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:16,308
and "China is in dire need of political reform."

155
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:19,267
But this claim is a rhetorical trap

156
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,883
hidden behind a political bias.

157
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,380
See, some have decided a priori

158
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,097
what kinds of changes they want to see,

159
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:29,869
and only such changes can be called political reform.

160
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,829
The truth is, political reforms have never stopped.

161
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,062
Compared with 30 years ago, 20 years, even 10 years ago,

162
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,452
every aspect of Chinese society,

163
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:39,324
how the country is governed,

164
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,572
from the most local level to the highest center,

165
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:44,057
are unrecognizable today.

166
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:47,243
Now such changes are simply not possible

167
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:50,963
without political reforms of the most fundamental kind.

168
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:53,156
Now I would venture to suggest the Party

169
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:57,263
is the world's leading expert in political reform.

170
00:07:57,263 --> 00:08:00,295
The second assumption is that in a one-party state,

171
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:03,026
power gets concentrated in the hands of the few,

172
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,728
and bad governance and corruption follow.

173
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,901
Indeed, corruption is a big problem,

174
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,035
but let's first look at the larger context.

175
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:12,163
Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.

176
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:15,182
The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic

177
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:17,978
political institutions in the world today.

178
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:22,079
China's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members.

179
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,167
In the most recent one, only five of them

180
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,789
came from a background of privilege, so-called princelings.

181
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,283
The other 20, including the president and the premier,

182
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:33,040
came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.

183
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,481
In the larger central committee of 300 or more,

184
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,348
the percentage of those who were born

185
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,807
into power and wealth was even smaller.

186
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,637
The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders

187
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,282
worked and competed their way to the top.

188
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,414
Compare that with the ruling elites

189
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,516
in both developed and developing countries,

190
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,026
I think you'll find the Party being near the top

191
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:54,660
in upward mobility.

192
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,189
The question then is, how could that be possible

193
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:00,408
in a system run by one party?

194
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,300
Now we come to a powerful political institution,

195
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,817
little-known to Westerners:

196
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:07,468
the Party's Organization Department.

197
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:09,668
The department functions like a giant

198
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:12,044
human resource engine that would be the envy

199
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:15,374
of even some of the most successful corporations.

200
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:17,643
It operates a rotating pyramid

201
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,010
made up of three components:

202
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,566
civil service, state-owned enterprises,

203
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,810
and social organizations like a university

204
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,948
or a community program.

205
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,459
They form separate yet integrated career paths

206
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,363
for Chinese officials.

207
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:33,448
They recruit college grads into entry-level positions

208
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,198
in all three tracks, and they start from the bottom,

209
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:37,754
called "keyuan" [clerk].

210
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,137
Then they could get promoted

211
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:44,253
through four increasingly elite ranks:

212
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:47,565
fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu [deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].

213
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,722
Now these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay?

214
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,219
It's serious business.

215
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,556
The range of positions is wide,

216
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:57,160
from running health care in a village

217
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,403
to foreign investment in a city district

218
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,528
to manager in a company.

219
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,850
Once a year, the department reviews their performance.

220
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,459
They interview their superiors, their peers,

221
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,240
their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct.

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,272
They conduct public opinion surveys.

223
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,235
Then they promote the winners.

224
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:14,783
Throughout their careers, these cadres

225
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,903
can move through and out of all three tracks.

226
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:20,781
Over time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels

227
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,473
to the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels.

228
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:26,317
There, they enter high officialdom.

229
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:28,477
By that point, a typical assignment will be

230
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,336
to manage a district with a population in the millions

231
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:34,867
or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

232
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,796
Just to show you how competitive the system is,

233
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:42,514
in 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels,

234
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:45,338
600,000 fuchu and chu levels,

235
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:48,773
and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.

236
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,501
After the ju levels,

237
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,102
the best few move further up several more ranks,

238
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:56,233
and eventually make it to the Central Committee.

239
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,985
The process takes two to three decades.

240
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:02,094
Does patronage play a role? Yes, of course.

241
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,666
But merit remains the fundamental driver.

242
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,196
In essence, the Organization Department runs

243
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,669
a modernized version of China's centuries-old

244
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,733
mentoring system.

245
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,824
China's new president, Xi Jinping,

246
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:17,403
is the son of a former leader, which is very unusual,

247
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,623
first of his kind to make the top job.

248
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:22,518
Even for him, the career took 30 years.

249
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,386
He started as a village manager,

250
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:26,298
and by the time he entered the Politburo,

251
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,504
he had managed areas with a total population

252
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,108
of 150 million people

253
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:34,554
and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

254
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:36,874
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?

255
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:40,128
This is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact.

256
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:43,962
George W. Bush, remember him?

257
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,403
This is not a put-down.

258
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:47,208
(Laughter)

259
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,307
Before becoming governor of Texas,

260
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:52,926
or Barack Obama before running for president,

261
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,685
could not make even a small county manager

262
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,613
in China's system.

263
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,635
Winston Churchill once said that democracy

264
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,954
is a terrible system except for all the rest.

265
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,235
Well, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department.

266
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,579
Now, Westerners always assume that

267
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,597
multi-party election with universal suffrage

268
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,739
is the only source of political legitimacy.

269
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,101
I was asked once, "The Party wasn't voted in by election.

270
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,331
Where is the source of legitimacy?"

271
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,893
I said, "How about competency?"

272
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,370
We all know the facts.

273
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,311
In 1949, when the Party took power,

274
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,638
China was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression,

275
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:34,933
average life expectancy at that time, 41 years old.

276
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:37,843
Today, it's the second largest economy in the world,

277
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,446
an industrial powerhouse, and its people live

278
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,533
in increasing prosperity.

279
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,686
Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes,

280
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,743
and here are the numbers in recent years.

281
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,243
Satisfaction with the direction of the country: 85 percent.

282
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:54,554
Those who think they're better off than five years ago:

283
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,818
70 percent.

284
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,202
Those who expect the future to be better:

285
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:01,866
a whopping 82 percent.

286
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,395
Financial Times polls global youth attitudes,

287
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,810
and these numbers, brand new, just came from last week.

288
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,592
Ninety-three percent of China's Generation Y

289
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:14,178
are optimistic about their country's future.

290
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:20,066
Now, if this is not legitimacy, I'm not sure what is.

291
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,235
In contrast, most electoral democracies around the world

292
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,338
are suffering from dismal performance.

293
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,653
I don't need to elaborate for this audience

294
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:31,990
how dysfunctional it is, from Washington to European capitals.

295
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,879
With a few exceptions, the vast number

296
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,786
of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes

297
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:41,597
are still suffering from poverty and civil strife.

298
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:43,537
Governments get elected, and then they fall

299
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,272
below 50 percent approval in a few months

300
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:49,820
and stay there and get worse until the next election.

301
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,243
Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle

302
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:54,621
of elect and regret.

303
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:58,150
At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,

304
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,770
not China's one-party system, that is in danger

305
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,029
of losing legitimacy.

306
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,879
Now, I don't want to create the misimpression

307
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,887
that China's hunky-dory, on the way

308
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,680
to some kind of superpowerdom.

309
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
The country faces enormous challenges.

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,542
The social and economic problems that come

311
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:18,548
with wrenching change like this are mind-boggling.

312
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:22,095
Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues.

313
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:26,042
On the political front, the worst problem is corruption.

314
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,874
Corruption is widespread and undermines the system

315
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,676
and its moral legitimacy.

316
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:33,523
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.

317
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,432
They say that corruption is the result of the one-party system,

318
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:37,933
and therefore, in order to cure it,

319
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,990
you have to do away with the entire system.

320
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,072
But a more careful look would tell us otherwise.

321
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,992
Transparency International ranks China

322
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:49,758
between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries,

323
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:51,935
and it's been moving up.

324
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:53,998
India, the largest democracy in the world,

325
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,145
94 and dropping.

326
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,607
For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China,

327
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,616
more than half of them are electoral democracies.

328
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,911
So if election is the panacea for corruption,

329
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:08,154
how come these countries can't fix it?

330
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:11,748
Now, I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets.

331
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,080
It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without

332
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,712
putting myself on the line and making some predictions.

333
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,429
So here they are.

334
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:21,231
In the next 10 years, China will surpass the U.S.

335
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,608
and become the largest economy in the world.

336
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:25,689
Income per capita will be near the top

337
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,871
of all developing countries.

338
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,193
Corruption will be curbed, but not eliminated,

339
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:32,606
and China will move up 10 to 20 notches

340
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,448
to above 60 in T.I. ranking.

341
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,375
Economic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue,

342
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,876
and the one-party system will hold firm.

343
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,034
We live in the dusk of an era.

344
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:48,319
Meta-narratives that make universal claims

345
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,280
failed us in the 20th century

346
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,064
and are failing us in the 21st.

347
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,658
Meta-narrative is the cancer

348
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:58,465
that is killing democracy from the inside.

349
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:00,232
Now, I want to clarify something.

350
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,752
I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy.

351
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,345
On the contrary, I think democracy contributed

352
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:08,541
to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world.

353
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,652
It is the universal claim that many Western elites

354
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:15,141
are making about their political system, the hubris,

355
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,380
that is at the heart of the West's current ills.

356
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,685
If they would spend just a little less time

357
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,825
on trying to force their way onto others,

358
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:26,477
and a little bit more on political reform at home,

359
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:29,882
they might give their democracy a better chance.

360
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:32,260
China's political model will never supplant

361
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,580
electoral democracy, because unlike the latter,

362
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,537
it doesn't pretend to be universal.

363
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,369
It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.

364
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,968
The significance of China's example

365
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,935
is not that it provides an alternative,

366
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:49,375
but the demonstration that alternatives exist.

367
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,009
Let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives.

368
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,372
Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals,

369
00:16:56,372 --> 00:17:00,473
but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over.

370
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:02,960
Let us stop telling people and our children

371
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,212
there's only one way to govern ourselves

372
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,021
and a singular future towards which

373
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,403
all societies must evolve.

374
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,198
It is wrong. It is irresponsible.

375
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,436
And worst of all, it is boring.

376
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,355
Let universality make way for plurality.

377
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:23,552
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.

378
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,765
Are we brave enough to welcome it?

379
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:26,959
Thank you.

380
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:42,978
(Applause)

381
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,614
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

382
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,820
Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay with me for a couple of minutes,

383
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,534
because I want to ask you a couple of questions.

384
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:55,062
I think many here, and in general in Western countries,

385
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:58,464
would agree with your statement about analysis

386
00:17:58,464 --> 00:18:01,169
of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional,

387
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,096
but at the same time, many would kind of find

388
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:08,041
unsettling the thought that there is an unelected

389
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:13,437
authority that, without any form of oversight or consultation,

390
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:16,352
decides what the national interest is.

391
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:19,354
What is the mechanism in the Chinese model

392
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:21,573
that allows people to say, actually,

393
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,160
the national interest as you defined it is wrong?

394
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,222
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist,

395
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:32,066
called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."

396
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,176
It's not exactly right, but I think it comes close.

397
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:39,150
So I know the largest public opinion survey company

398
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,032
in China, okay?

399
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,712
Do you know who their biggest client is?

400
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,558
The Chinese government.

401
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,024
Not just from the central government,

402
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,448
the city government, the provincial government,

403
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,527
to the most local neighborhood districts.

404
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,670
They conduct surveys all the time.

405
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,280
Are you happy with the garbage collection?

406
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,392
Are you happy with the general direction of the country?

407
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:01,653
So there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism

408
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:05,214
to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people.

409
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:08,422
My point is, I think we should get unstuck

410
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:10,853
from the thinking that there's only one political system --

411
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,398
election, election, election --

412
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,126
that could make it responsive.

413
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:16,110
I'm not sure, actually, elections produce

414
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,056
responsive government anymore in the world.

415
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:23,763
(Applause)

416
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,923
BG: Many seem to agree.

417
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:27,579
One of the features of a democratic system

418
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:30,848
is a space for civil society to express itself.

419
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:33,216
And you have shown figures about the support

420
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:36,120
that the government and the authorities have in China.

421
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,425
But then you've just mentioned other elements

422
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,579
like, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course,

423
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,505
a lot of other data that go in a different direction:

424
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:47,162
tens of thousands of unrests and protests

425
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:50,021
and environmental protests, etc.

426
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:53,037
So you seem to suggest the Chinese model

427
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,148
doesn't have a space outside of the Party

428
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,449
for civil society to express itself.

429
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:01,627
EXL: There's a vibrant civil society in China,

430
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,256
whether it's environment or what-have-you.

431
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,504
But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it.

432
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,386
Because, by Western definitions, a so-called civil society

433
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:11,230
has to be separate or even in opposition

434
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,921
to the political system,

435
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:17,686
but that concept is alien for Chinese culture.

436
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:20,159
For thousands of years, you have civil society,

437
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,648
yet they are consistent and coherent

438
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:25,495
and part of a political order, and I think

439
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:28,865
it's a big cultural difference.

440
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:32,492
BG: Eric, thank you for sharing this with TED.
EXL: Thank you.
