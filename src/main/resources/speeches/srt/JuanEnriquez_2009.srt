1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
So let's start talking about that.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
That's what I have behind myself.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
(Laughter)

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
But of course what we have to remember is this.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
And what you have to think about is,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
is I'm going to talk first about the flames --

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
where we are in the economy --

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
and then I'm going to take three trends

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
and that will take place in this conference

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
and I will try and bring them together.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Those three trends are

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
the ability to engineer cells,

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
the ability to engineer tissues,

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and robots.

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And somehow it will all make sense.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
But anyway, let's start with the economy.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
One is leverage.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
And the problem with leverage is

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
(Laughter)

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
it's an investment bank;

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
it has 15 to 20 times.

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Oops.

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you

38
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
are making such generous and wonderful donations

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
to these nice folks.

40
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
And as you think about that,

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
(Laughter)

43
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
It ain't pretty.

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,820
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
We all love Santa Claus, right?

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
But the problem with Santa Clause is,

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
and promising folks,

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,820
it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending

50
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
on what we call "entitlements."

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,820
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.

53
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
that we've brought that date of reckoning forward

55
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
to about 2017.

56
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
but, guess what?

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
We're going to start to pay them.

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,

60
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,820
it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Right?

62
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
(Laughter)

63
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.

65
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.

66
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
And he gave an interview in December.

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Here's his first bit of advice.

68
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And here's his second bit of advice.

69
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
And, by the way,

70
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
This stuff is getting serious enough

72
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
we're going to end up losing the dollar.

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And then all bets are off.

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Let me show you what it looks like.

76
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
I think I can safely say

77
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.

78
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
This is an actual bill.

79
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And it's 10 triliion dollars.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,

82
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
a buck next week.

83
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.

84
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,820
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,

85
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:43,820
and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --

86
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
you've just got to say no.

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
And the reason we have to do that in the short term

89
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
is because we have just run out of cash.

90
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.

91
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
The orange slice is what's discretionary.

92
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Everything else is mandated.

93
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
So what we have to start thinking about doing

95
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
is capping our medical spending

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.

97
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
We've got to start thinking about asking people

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
to retire a little bit later.

99
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.

100
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Your 401(k) just got nailed.

101
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.

102
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.

103
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
The reason why that's reasonable is,

104
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
when your grandparents were given Social Security,

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.

106
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Sixty-eight is young today.

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,820
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

108
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.

109
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
We've got to quit borrowing as much,

110
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.

112
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
And if we don't start changing this trend line,

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
we are going to lose the dollar

114
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
and start to look like Iceland.

115
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
I got what you're thinking.

116
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,820
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.

117
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
(Laughter)

119
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.

120
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis

121
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
back in the late '80s.

122
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
And its 225 largest companies today

123
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.

124
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
We don't fix this now,

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?

126
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.

127
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
And unless you want this person

128
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,

129
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
we'd better deal with this stuff.

130
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
That's the short term. That's the flame part.

131
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
That's the financial crisis.

132
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave

133
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
that we need to talk about.

134
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
That wave is much larger, much more powerful,

135
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
and that's of course the wave of technology.

136
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
And what's really important in this stuff is,

137
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
as we cut, we also have to grow.

138
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Among other things, because startup companies

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm

140
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
and they're about 17.8 percent of output.

141
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.

142
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
And that's what we've got to keep growing.

143
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.

144
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,820
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.

145
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,820
And that's where these three trends come together.

146
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
That's where the ability to engineer microbes,

147
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
the ability to engineer tissues,

148
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
and the ability to engineer robots

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
begin to lead to a reboot.

150
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.

151
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Craig Venter showed up last year

152
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware

153
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.

154
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
In parallel, the folks at MIT

155
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
have been building a standard registry of biological parts.

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.

157
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.

158
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
And start building stuff.

159
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students

160
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
and started to build these little odd creatures.

161
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.

162
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
Here was one of the first things they built.

163
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
So, cells have this cycle.

164
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
First they don't grow.

165
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Then they grow exponentially.

166
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Then they stop growing.

167
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.

168
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
So they engineered these cells

169
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
they would smell like wintergreen.

171
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.

172
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

173
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.

174
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
This got a bit more complicated two years later.

175
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.

176
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
They started competing.

177
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine

178
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
that makes red wine good for you

179
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
into beer.

180
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,820
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.

181
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,

182
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,820
"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."

183
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
(Laughter)

184
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way

186
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
that they would act as your kidneys.

187
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.

188
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
And people oohed and ahhed,

189
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.

190
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
And that was very cool stuff back then.

191
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,

192
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
let me show you what's happened in that period of time.

193
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Two years ago, you saw this creature.

194
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico

195
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
called an axolotl

196
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
that can re-generate its limbs.

197
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.

198
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.

199
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
It's almost like leaving Congress.

200
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
(Laughter)

201
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,820
because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.

203
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,

204
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.

205
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
This should not surprise you, right?

206
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I mean, you're born with no teeth.

207
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.

208
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
You re-grow a set of teeth.

209
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,

210
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
unless, if you're a lawyer.

211
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,820
(Laughter)

212
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
But, of course, for most of us,

213
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,

214
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,

215
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
and simply implant it.

216
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
And we can do it with other things.

217
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,820
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,

218
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
they took all the cells off the trachea,

219
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.

220
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
She regrew her own trachea,

221
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
and 72 hours later it was implanted.

222
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
She's now running around with her kids.

223
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest

224
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,

225
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,820
and he's also re-growing bladders.

226
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
So there are now nine women walking around Boston

227
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
with re-grown bladders,

228
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags

229
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
for the rest of your life.

230
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
This is kind of getting boring, right?

231
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
I mean, you understand where this story's going.

232
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
But, I mean it gets more interesting.

233
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,

234
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
leaving just the cartilage.

235
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.

236
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.

237
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Life happens.

238
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
This may be one of the ultimate papers.

239
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,

240
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
That meant that you can take the stuff right here,

242
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
and turn it into almost anything in your body.

243
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,

244
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
it's moving in a whole series of places.

245
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Third trend: robots.

246
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now

247
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.

248
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And all we've got is a Roomba.

249
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
(Laughter)

250
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,820
We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.

251
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Didn't happen.

252
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?

253
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
So, Rosie runs around on skates

254
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
and the other one ran on flat threads.

255
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,

256
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,820
which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.

257
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."

258
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

259
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,820
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,

260
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,

261
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --

262
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
that's when computers have reached human intelligence.

263
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
This is not an intelligence Turing rest,

264
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

265
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
And this stuff is moving very quickly,

266
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.

267
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
These are not the only interesting robots.

268
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
You've also got flies, the size of flies,

269
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.

270
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.

271
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
And as you bring these things together,

272
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,820
as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,

273
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
you begin to get some really odd questions.

274
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
In the last Olympics, this gentleman,

275
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,820
who had several world records in the Special Olympics,

276
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
tried to run in the normal Olympics.

277
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius

278
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,820
is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.

279
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
He came within about a second of qualifying.

280
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
He sued to be allowed to run,

281
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
and he won the suit,

282
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
but didn't qualify by time.

283
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,

284
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
is going to make the time.

285
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.

286
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,820
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means

287
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,820
to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --

288
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?

289
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,

290
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
and then your parents had these odd boxes

291
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
that would squawk at odd times during dinner,

292
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.

293
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
And now you have cochlear implants

294
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,820
that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.

295
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.

296
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,

297
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
and these are machine generations, not human generations.

298
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,820
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,

299
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,

300
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.

301
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
They'll be able to focus their hearing,

302
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,

303
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
do a series of things that we can't do.

304
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
And the same thing is happening in eyes.

305
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes

306
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,820
so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.

307
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Very primitive.

308
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
And then they'll be able to see shape.

309
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,

310
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.

311
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,

312
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,

313
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
they'll be able to come into a microfocus.

314
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.

315
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
All of these things are coming together,

316
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,820
and it's a particularly important thing to understand,

317
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
as we worry about the flames of the present,

318
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
to keep an eye on the future.

319
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,

320
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.

321
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,820
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."

322
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,820
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.

323
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,820
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.

324
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,820
There have actually been 22 species of hominids

325
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,820
that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,

326
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
have gone extinct.

327
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,820
It is common for hominids to evolve.

328
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,

329
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:56,820
erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,

330
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,820
and Homo sapiens, all overlap.

331
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,820
The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,

332
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
not one.

333
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
And as you think of the implications of that,

334
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
here's a brief history of the universe.

335
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,

336
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,

337
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.

338
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,

339
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
and then you got life about four billion years ago,

340
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,

341
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,820
and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.

342
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Ta-dah!

343
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,

344
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,

345
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff

346
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,820
is to create what's in this room.

347
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Maybe not.

348
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.

349
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
(Laughter)

350
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,820
So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?

351
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,820
(Laughter)

352
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,820
I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

353
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.

354
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.

355
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
I think most of us are going to glance at it,

356
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.

357
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends

358
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control

359
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,820
over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.

360
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,820
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.

361
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Thank you very much.

362
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
(Applause)
