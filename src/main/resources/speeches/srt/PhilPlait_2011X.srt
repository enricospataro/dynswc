1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I want to talk to you about something

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
kind of big.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
We'll start here.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
65 million years ago

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
the dinosaurs had a bad day.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
(Laughter)

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
A chunk of rock six miles across,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
moving something like 50 times

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
the speed of a rifle bullet,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
slammed into the Earth.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
It released its energy all at once,

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
and it was an explosion that was

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
mind-numbing.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
If you took every nuclear weapon ever built

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
at the height of the Cold War,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
lumped them together and blew them up

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
at the same time,

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
that would be one one-millionth

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,820
of the energy released at that moment.

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Okay?

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
We all live here in Boulder.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
If you look out your window and you can see

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Long's Peak, you're probably familiar with it.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Now, scoop up Long's Peak, and put it out

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
in space.

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
Take Meeker, Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there,

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and put that in space as well,

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
and Mt. Everest, and K2,

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
and the Indian peaks.

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
Then you're starting to get an idea of

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
how much rock we're talking about, okay?

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
We know it was that big because of

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
the impact it had and the crater it left.

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
It hit in what we now know as Yucatan,

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
the Gulf of Mexico.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
You can see here, there's the

39
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel

40
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
off the east coast there.

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Here is how big of a crater was left.

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale,

43
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
okay, there you go. The scale here is

44
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
on the bottom. This thing was

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
300 kilometers across -- 200 miles --

47
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
an enormous crater that excavated out

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
vast amounts of earth that splashed around

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
the globe and set fires all over the planet,

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
threw up enough dust to block out the sun.

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
It wiped out 75 percent of all species

52
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
on Earth.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Now, not all asteroids are that big.

54
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Some of them are smaller.

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Here is one that came in

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
over the United States

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
in October of 1992.

58
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
It came in on a Friday night.

59
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Why is that important?

60
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Because back then, video cameras were

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
just starting to become popular, and people

62
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
would bring them, parents would bring them,

63
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
to their kids' football games to film their kids

64
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
play football. And since this came in on a Friday,

65
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
they were able to get this great footage

66
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
of this thing breaking up as it came in

67
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
over West Virgina, Maryland, Pennsylvania

68
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and New Jersey until it did that

69
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
to a car in New York.

70
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
(Laughter)

71
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,

72
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
but then again you can see the rock

73
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
which is sitting right here,

74
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
about the size of a football, that hit

75
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
that car and did that damage.

76
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Now this thing was probably about the size

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
of a school bus when it first came in.

78
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
It broke up through atmospheric pressure,

79
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart

80
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
and did some damage.

81
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot

82
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
or your head, because it would do that to it.

83
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
That would be bad.

84
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
But it won't wipe out, you know, all life

85
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
on Earth, so that's fine. But it turns out,

86
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
you don't need something six miles across

87
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
to do a lot of damage.

88
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
There is a median point between tiny rock

89
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you

90
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,

91
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
there is a crater in the desert there that is

92
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,820
so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater.

93
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.

94
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot,

95
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
and those are recreational vehicles right there.

96
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.

97
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
The object that formed this was probably about

98
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size

99
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
of Mackey Auditorium here.

100
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
It came in at speeds that were tremendous,

101
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
slammed into the ground, blew up,

102
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and exploded with the energy of roughly

103
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --

104
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
a very hefty bomb.

105
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have

106
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
wiped out a few buffalo or antelope,

107
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
or something like that out in the desert,

108
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
but it probably would not have caused

109
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
global devastation.

110
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
It turns out that these things don't have to

111
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
hit the ground to do a lot of damage.

112
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Tunguska region -- for those of you who are

114
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters,"

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift

116
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got

117
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
the date wrong, but that's okay. (Laughter)

118
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.

119
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
(Laughter)

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere

121
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
and this one blew up above the ground, several

122
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
miles up above the surface of the Earth.

123
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
The heat from the explosion set fire to the

124
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
forest below it, and then the shock wave

125
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
came down and knocked down trees for

126
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
hundreds of square miles, okay?

127
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
This did a huge amount of damage.

128
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
And again, this was a rock probably roughly

129
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in.

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
In Meteor Crater it was made of metal,

131
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
and metal is much tougher, so it made it

132
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
to the ground.

133
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
The one over Tunguska was probably made

134
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it

135
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
blew up in the air. Either way, these are

136
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
tremendous explosions, 20 megatons.

137
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Now, when these things blow up, they're not

138
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
going to do global ecological damage.

139
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
They're not going to do something like

140
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
the dinosaur-killer did.

141
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
They're just not big enough.

142
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
But they will do global economic damage,

143
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
because they don't have to hit, necessarily,

144
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
to do this kind of damage.

145
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
They don't have to do global devastation.

146
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
If one of these things were to hit

147
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic.

148
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
But if it came over a city, an important city --

149
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
not that any city is more important than others,

150
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
but some of them we depend on them more

151
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
on the global economic basis -- that could do

152
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
a huge amount of damage to us

153
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
as a civilization.

154
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ...

155
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
(Laughter)

156
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
what can we do about this? All right?

157
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
This is a potential threat.

158
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Let me note that we have not had

159
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer

160
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
for 65 million years. They're very rare.

161
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,820
The smaller ones happen more often, but

162
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
probably on the order of a millennium,

163
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
every few centuries or every few thousand

164
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
years, but it's still something to be aware of.

165
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Well, what do we do about them?

166
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
The first thing we have to do is find them.

167
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
This is an image of an asteroid that passed

168
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
us in 2009.

169
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
It's right here.

170
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
But you can see that it's extremely faint.

171
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
I don't even know if you can see that

172
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
in the back row. These are just stars.

173
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
This is a rock that was about 30 yards across,

174
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
so roughly the size of the ones that blew up

175
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.

176
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
These things are faint.

177
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.

178
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
We have to find these things first.

179
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Well the good news is, we're looking for them.

180
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
NASA has devoted money to this.

181
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
The National Science Foundation, other

182
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
countries are very interested in doing this.

183
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
We're building telescopes that are looking

184
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
for the threat. That's a great first step,

185
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
but what's the second step? The second step

186
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
is that we see one heading toward us,

187
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
we have to stop it. What do we do?

188
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
You've probably heard about the asteroid

189
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Apophis. If you haven't yet, you will.

190
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
If you've heard about the Mayan 2012

191
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis,

192
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
because you're keyed in to all the doomsday

193
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
networks anyway.

194
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.

195
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
It's roughly 250 yards across, so it's

196
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
pretty big -- big size, you know,

197
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
bigger than a football stadium -- and it's going to

198
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
pass by the Earth in April of 2029.

199
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
And it's going to pass us so close that it's

200
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
actually going to come underneath

201
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
our weather satellites.

202
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit

203
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
of this thing so much that if it's just right,

204
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
if it passes through this region of space,

205
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
this kidney bean-shaped region called

206
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it

207
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
just enough that seven years later

208
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
on April 13, which is a Friday, I'll note,

209
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
in the year 2036 ... (Laughter)

210
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
-- you can't plan that kind of stuff --

211
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Apophis is going to hit us. And it's

212
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
250 meters across, so it would do

213
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
unbelievable damage.

214
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Now the good news is that the odds of it

215
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
actually passing through this keyhole and

216
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
hitting us next go-around are one in a million,

217
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
roughly -- very, very low odds, so I personally

218
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.

219
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I don't think Apophis is a problem.

220
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,

221
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
because it woke us up to the dangers

222
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
of these things.

223
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
This thing was discovered just a few years

224
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
ago and could hit us a few years from now.

225
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
It won't, but it gives us a chance to study

226
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really

227
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
necessarily understand these keyholes, and

228
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
now we do and it turns out

229
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
that's really important, because how do you

230
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
stop an asteroid like this?

231
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're

232
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
standing in the middle of the road and a car's

233
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
headed for you? What do you do? You do this.

234
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Right? Move. The car goes past you.

235
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
But we can't move the Earth, at least

236
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
not easily, but we can move a small asteroid.

237
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
And it turns out, we've even done it.

238
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe

239
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
called Deep Impact, which slammed into --

240
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.

241
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Comets are very much like asteroids.

242
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way.

243
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
The purpose was to make a crater to excavate

244
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
the material and see what was underneath

245
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
the surface of this comet, which we learned

246
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
quite a bit about.

247
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
We did move the comet a little tiny bit,

248
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
not very much, but that wasn't the point.

249
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
However, think about this.

250
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
This thing is orbiting the sun at

251
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
10 miles per second, 20 miles per second.

252
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay?

253
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.

254
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
That means we can do it again.

255
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
If we need, if we see an asteroid that's coming

256
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
toward us, and it's headed right for us,

257
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
and we have two years to go, boom! We hit it.

258
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
You can try to -- you know, if you watch

259
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
the movies, you might think about,

260
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
why don't we use a nuclear weapon?

261
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
It's like, well, you can try that, but the problem is timing.

262
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,

263
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds

264
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
of tolerance or else you'll just miss it.

265
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
And there are a lot of other problems

266
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
with that. It's very hard to do.

267
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
But just hitting something? That's pretty easy.

268
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I think even NASA can do that,

269
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and they proved that they can. (Laughter)

270
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
The problem is, what happens if you hit

271
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
this asteroid, you've changed the orbit,

272
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
you measure the orbit and then you find out,

273
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,

274
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
and now it's going to hit us in three years.

275
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay?

276
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
It's not hitting us in six months. That's good.

277
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Now we have three years to do something else.

278
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
And you can hit it again. That's kind of

279
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
ham-fisted. You might just push it into a third

280
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
keyhole or whatever, so you don't do that.

281
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,820
And this is the part, it's the part I just love.

282
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
(Laughter)

283
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
After the big macho "Rrrrrrr BAM! We're

284
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
gonna hit this thing in the face,"

285
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
then we bring in the velvet gloves.

286
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
(Laughter)

287
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
There's a group of scientists and engineers

288
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
and astronauts and they call themselves

289
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
The B612 Foundation. For those of you

290
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
who've read "The Little Prince,"

291
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
you understand that reference, I hope. The little prince

292
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
who lived on an asteroid, it was called B612.

293
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
These are smart guys -- men and women --

294
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
astronauts, like I said, engineers.

295
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9

296
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
astronaut, is on this. Dan Durda, my friend

297
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
who made this image, works here at

298
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder,

299
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
on Walnut Street. He created this image for this,

300
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
and he's actually one of the astronomers

301
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
who works for them. If we see an asteroid

302
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
that's going to hit the Earth and we have

303
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
enough time, we can hit it to move it into

304
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch

305
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
a probe that has to weigh a ton or two.

306
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
It doesn't have to be huge -- couple of tons,

307
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid.

308
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
You don't land on it, because these things are

309
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them.

310
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Instead you get near it.

311
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe,

312
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
and the probe has a couple of tons of mass.

313
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
It has a little tiny bit of gravity, but it's enough

314
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
that it can pull the asteroid, and you have your

315
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
rockets set up, so you can -- oh, you can barely

316
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
see it here, but there's rocket plumes -- and you

317
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
basically, these guys are connected by their

318
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
own gravity, and if you move the probe very

319
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
slowly, very, very gently, you can very easily

320
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
finesse that rock into a safe orbit.

321
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
You can even put in orbit around the Earth

322
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
where we could mine it, although that's a

323
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
whole other thing. I won't go into that.

324
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
(Laughter)

325
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
But we'd be rich!

326
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,820
(Laughter)

327
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
So think about this, right?

328
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
There are these giant rocks flying out there,

329
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
and they're hitting us, and they're doing

330
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
damage to us, but we've figured out how to do

331
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
this, and all the pieces are in place to do this.

332
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
We have astronomers in place with telescopes

333
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
looking for them. We have smart people,

334
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
very, very smart people, who are concerned

335
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
about this and figuring out how to fix the

336
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
problem, and we have the technology to do this.

337
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
This probe actually can't use chemical rockets.

338
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too

339
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
much push. The probe would just shoot away.

340
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
We invented something called an ion drive,

341
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.

342
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
It generates the force a piece of paper would

343
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
have on your hand, incredibly light,

344
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
but it can run for months and years,

345
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
providing that very gentle push.

346
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
If anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek,"

347
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
they ran across an alien ship that had

348
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
an ion drive, and Spock said,

349
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
"They're very technically sophisticated.

350
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."

351
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Yeah, we have an ion drive now. (Laughter)

352
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
We don't have the Enterprise, but

353
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
we've got an ion drive now.

354
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
(Applause)

355
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Spock.

356
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
(Laughter)

357
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
So ...

358
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
that's the difference, that's the difference

359
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
between us and the dinosaurs.

360
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
This happened to them.

361
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
It doesn't have to happen to us.

362
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
The difference between the dinosaurs and us

363
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
is that we have a space program

364
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
and we can vote,

365
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
and so we can change our future.

366
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
(Laughter)

367
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
We have the ability to change our future.

368
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
65 million years from now,

369
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
we don't have to have our bones

370
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
collecting dust in a museum.

371
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Thank you very much.

372
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
(Applause)
