1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm often asked,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
what surprises you about the book?

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
And I said, that I got to write it.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I would have never imagined that,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
not in my wildest dreams did I think --

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I don't even consider myself to be an author.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
And I'm often asked,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
why do you think so many people have read this?

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,820
And I think it's because spiritual emptiness

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
is a universal disease.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go,

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
"There's got to be more to life than this."

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV,

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,820
go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
go to parties on weekends.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
A lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living -- that's just existing.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Just existing.

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,820
I really think that's there's this inner desire.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
I do believe what Chris said. I believe that you're not an accident.

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
I don't think there are accidental kids.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
And I think you matter.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history;

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
I think you matter to this universe.

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
And I think that the difference between

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,820
what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
and the significant level of living is,

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
do you figure out, what on Earth am I here for?

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,820
I meet a lot of people who are very smart,

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
and say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?"

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
And I meet a lot of people who are very successful,

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Why do I feel like a fake?

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Why do I feel like

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,820
I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?"

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I think it comes down to this issue of:

40
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?

41
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
These are not religious issues --

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
they're human issues.

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
that I really appreciate what he does,

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
because it makes my life work a whole lot easier.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life.

48
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Religion doesn't have a

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks.

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day,

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one --

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
and she said, "What do you see in it?"

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
And I looked at it and I said, "Oh, I don't see anything."

55
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left.

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
I'm going, OK, you know. Fine.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Um.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Good for you. (Laughter)

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years,

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
I kind of had my little crisis.

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
And that was: what is the purpose of this?

62
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money.

63
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
When you write the best-selling book in the world,

64
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
it's tons and tons of money --

65
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
and it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.

66
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,820
I started it with one other family in 1980.

68
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And I decided that I was never going to go on TV,

69
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
because I didn't want to be a celebrity,

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
I didn't want to be a, quote, "evangelist, televangelist" --

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
that's not my thing.

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,820
And all of a sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.

73
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
I don't think --

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.

75
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Everybody's betting their life on something.

76
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
You're betting your life on something --

77
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.

78
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
So, everybody's betting their life on something,

79
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,820
and when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe

80
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
that Jesus was who he said he was.

81
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
But everybody's got -- and I believe in a pluralistic society --

82
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
everybody's betting on something.

83
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
And when I started the church,

84
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.

85
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And then when I wrote this book,

86
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
and all of a sudden it just

87
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
took off,

88
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
then I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Because as I started to say,

90
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't think you're given money or fame

91
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
for your own ego, ever.

92
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
I just don't believe that.

93
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is,

94
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
"It's not about you,"

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
then, when all of a sudden

96
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
it becomes the best-selling book in history,

97
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
you got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me.

98
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
That's kind of a no-brainer.

99
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
So, what is it for?

100
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
And I began to think about what I call the "stewardship of affluence"

101
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
and the "stewardship of influence."

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
So I believe, essentially, that leadership is stewardship.

103
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
That if you are a leader in any area --

104
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
in business, in politics, in sports, in art,

105
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
in academics, in any area --

106
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
you don't own it;

107
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
you are a steward of it.

108
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.

109
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born.

110
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
It's not going to be mine after I die.

111
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.

112
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,820
I was debating the other day on a talk show,

113
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
and the guy was challenging me and go,

114
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?"

115
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
And I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe

116
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,820
that human beings are responsible

117
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,820
to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?

118
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Do you think we have a stewardship here,

119
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
to take the environment seriously?"

120
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
And he said, "No."

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
I said, "Oh, you don't?" I said, "Let me make this clear again.

122
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion --

123
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility

124
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?"

125
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
And he said, "No.

126
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Not any more than any other species."

127
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
When he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview.

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,820
And he was saying, "I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment

129
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
than a duck is."

130
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,

131
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
but you're not a duck.

132
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
You're not a duck.

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And you are responsible -- that's my worldview.

134
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,820
And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.

135
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,820
The problem is most people never really think it through.

136
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,820
They never really

137
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
codify it or qualify it or quantify it,

138
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
and say, "This is what I believe in.

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
This is why I believe what I believe."

140
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.

141
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
But you may, you may.

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,

143
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
because it determines your decisions;

144
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
it determines your relationships;

145
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
it determines your level of confidence.

146
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
It determines, really, everything in your life.

147
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
What we believe, obviously --

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
and you know this -- determines our behavior,

149
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
and our behavior determines what we become in life.

150
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
So all of this money started pouring in,

151
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
and all of this fame started pouring in,

152
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
and I go, what do I do with this?

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,820
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.

154
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
We said, "First,

155
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
we're not going to use it on ourselves."

156
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.

157
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I don't own a guesthouse.

158
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I still drive the same four-year-old Ford that I've driven.

159
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
We just said, we're not going to use it on us.

160
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
The second thing was,

161
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,820
I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.

162
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years,

163
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
and I gave it back.

164
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking

165
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
that I do what I do for money -- I don't.

166
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
In fact, personally, I've never met

167
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.

168
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I know that's a stereotype. I've never met one of them.

169
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.

170
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Pastors are like on 24-hours-a-day call. They're like doctors.

171
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I left late today. I'd hoped to be here yesterday,

172
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours

173
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
before he dies of cancer.

174
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life --

175
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
he's now in his mid-80s --

176
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,820
and he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview

177
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
is not how you act in the good times.

178
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,820
The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.

179
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,820
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,

180
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
it makes a difference.

181
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
It makes a difference what you believe.

182
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,820
So, we gave it all back,

183
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
and then we set up three foundations,

184
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
working on some of the major problems of the world:

185
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,820
illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases -- particularly HIV/AIDS --

186
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
and set up these three foundations,

187
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
and put the money into that.

188
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,820
The last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers."

189
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
And that is, when my wife and I got married

190
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
30 years ago,

191
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
we started tithing.

192
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Now, that's a principle in the Bible

193
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,

194
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
give it away to help other people.

195
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,820
So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe 1 percent.

196
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,

197
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
second year we went to 12 percent,

198
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
and the third year we went to 13 percent,

199
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
and on and on and on. Why did I do that?

200
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Because every time I give,

201
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.

202
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can,

203
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,820
can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.

204
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,820
It's all about more, having more.

205
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
And we think that the good life is actually looking good --

206
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
that's most important of all -- looking good,

207
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
feeling good and having the goods.

208
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
But that's not the good life.

209
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I meet people all the time who have those,

210
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
and they're not necessarily happy.

211
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
If money actually made you happy,

212
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.

213
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And that I know, personally, I know, is not true.

214
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
It's just not true.

215
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,820
So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods;

216
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
it's about being good and doing good.

217
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Giving your life away.

218
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Significance in life doesn't come from status,

219
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
because you can always find somebody who's got more than you.

220
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
It doesn't come from sex.

221
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
It doesn't come from salary.

222
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It comes from serving.

223
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning,

224
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
we find significance.

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.

226
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
And so we began to give away,

227
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
and now after 30 years,

228
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
my wife and I are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10.

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
That, actually, was the easy part.

230
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?

231
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Because I start getting all kinds of invitations.

232
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour

233
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
on three different continents,

234
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
and I won't go into that,

235
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
but it was an amazing thing.

236
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
And I'm going, what do I do with

237
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,820
this notoriety that the book has brought?

238
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.

239
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72,

240
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.

241
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
When you read this prayer,

242
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.

243
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
It sounds like,

244
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
he says, "God, I want you to make me famous."

245
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
That's what he prays.

246
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
He says, "I want you to make me famous.

247
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land.

248
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I want you to give me power.

249
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I want you to make me famous.

250
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I want you to give me influence."

251
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make

252
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
if you were going to pray.

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.

254
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
And then he says, "So that the king" --

255
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,820
he was the king of Israel at that time at its apex in power --

256
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
"so that the king may care for the widow and orphan,

257
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,820
support depressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,

258
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,820
assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,

259
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
those in prison."

260
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.

261
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
And as I read that,

262
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,820
I looked at it, and I thought, you know,

263
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up

264
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
for those who have no influence.

265
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
The purpose of influence is not to build your ego,

266
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
or your net worth.

267
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing

268
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
as your self-worth.

269
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Your value is not based on your valuables;

270
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
it's based on a whole different set of things.

271
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
And so the purpose of influence is to speak up

272
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
for those who have no influence.

273
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
And I had to admit,

274
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.

275
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
They're not on my radar.

276
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America --

277
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
a bunch of gated communities.

278
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.

279
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,820
And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.

280
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
They're just not in my pathway.

281
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.

282
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
So, I had to say, "OK,

283
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got

284
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,820
to help those who don't have either of those."

285
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses.

286
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Whether you believe it's true or not --

287
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
it really didn't matter to me.

288
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
But Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments,"

289
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him.

290
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
And God says, "Moses,

291
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
what's in your hand?"

292
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked.

293
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
What's in your hand?

294
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Moses says, "It's a staff.

295
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
It's a shepherd's staff."

296
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
And God says, "Throw it down."

297
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.

298
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
And then God says, "Pick it up."

299
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
And he picks it back up again,

300
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
and it becomes a staff again.

301
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?

302
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.

303
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off.

304
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"

305
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.

306
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
You know, if God's going to show up,

307
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
He's not going to show up on cheese bread.

308
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
(Laughter)

309
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,820
OK? I just, this is why I love what Michael does,

310
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,820
because it's like, OK, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.

311
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images.

312
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
He got a few more powerful ways than that

313
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
to do whatever he wants to do.

314
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
But He doesn't do miracles just to show off.

315
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question,

316
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
He already knows the answer.

317
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Obviously, if He's God, then that would mean

318
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
that when He asks the question, it's for your benefit, not His.

319
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
So, He's going, "What's in your hand?"

320
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Now, what was in Moses' hand?

321
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.

322
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
This staff represented three things about Moses' life.

323
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
First, it represented his identity.

324
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,820
He was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation.

325
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,820
I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.

326
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity;

327
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.

328
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
In those days nobody had bank accounts,

329
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
or American Express cards, or hedge funds.

330
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.

331
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.

332
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.

333
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
What do you do with a shepherd's staff?

334
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it,

335
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
by hook or by crook.

336
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
You pull them or you poke them, one or the other.

337
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
So, He's saying,

338
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
"You're going to lay down your identity.

339
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,820
What's in your hand? You've got identity; you've got income; you've got influence.

340
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
What's in your hand?"

341
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
And He's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.

342
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
I'll do some things you could never imagine possible."

343
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
And if you've watched that movie, "Ten Commandments,"

344
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt

345
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,820
are done through this staff.

346
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Last year, I was invited to speak at NBA All-Stars game.

347
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
And so, I'm talking to the players,

348
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams

349
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.

350
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?

351
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,820
So, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball,

352
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,820
and that basketball represents your identity, who you are.

353
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,820
You're an NBA player. It represents your income.

354
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
You're making a lot of money off that little ball.

355
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
And it represents your influence.

356
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,820
And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,

357
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life.

358
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
And that gives with you enormous influence.

359
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?"

360
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,820
And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today,

361
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
to all of you very bright people at TED,

362
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
is to say, "What's in your hand?"

363
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,820
What do you have that you've been given?

364
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Talent, background, education,

365
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,820
freedom, networks, opportunities,

366
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
wealth, ideas, creativity.

367
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
What are you doing

368
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
with what you've been given?

369
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,820
That, to me, is the primary question about life.

370
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,820
That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.

371
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,820
In the book I talk about how you're wired to do certain things, you're shaped.

372
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
This little cross takes spiritual gifts, heart,

373
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
ability, personality and experiences.

374
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
These things shape you.

375
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life,

376
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
you need to look at your shape. What am I wired to do?

377
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
Why would God wire you to do something

378
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
and then not have you do it?

379
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.

380
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
If you're wired to be an undersea explorer,

381
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
you'll be an undersea explorer.

382
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
If you're wired to make deals, you make deals.

383
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
If you're wired to paint, you paint.

384
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Did you know that God smiles when you be you?

385
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,820
When my little kids were little --

386
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
they're all grown, now I have grandkids --

387
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed,

388
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,820
and I used to watch my kids sleep.

389
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,820
And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower,

390
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
rise and lower.

391
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
And I would look at them -- this is not an accident.

392
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
Rise and lower --

393
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,820
and I got joy out of just watching them sleep.

394
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited

395
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
when you're doing, quote, "spiritual things,"

396
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,820
like going to church or helping the poor,

397
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,820
or, you know, confessing or doing something like that.

398
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,820
The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why?

399
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,820
He made you. And when you do what you were made to do,

400
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
He goes, "That's my boy.

401
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
That's my girl.

402
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
You're using the talent and ability that I gave you."

403
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
So my advice to you is,

404
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
look at what's in your hand --

405
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,820
your identity, your influence, your income --

406
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
and say, "It's not about me.

407
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
It's about making the world a better place."

408
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Thank you.
