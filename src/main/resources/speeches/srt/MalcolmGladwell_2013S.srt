1
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:13,639
So I wanted to tell a story

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,111
that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,

3
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:20,658
and it's a story of something that happened

4
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,231
3,000 years ago,

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,458
when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,190
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,520
in what is now Israel.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,768
And the reason the story obsessed me is that

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,854
I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it

10
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:39,960
and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,777
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,

12
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,093
there's a mountain range.

13
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,952
Still same is true of Israel today.

14
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:50,885
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities

15
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:55,343
of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.

16
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,568
And then there's a coastal plain

17
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,923
along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.

18
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:04,323
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain

19
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,256
is an area called the Shephelah,

20
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:10,675
which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,

21
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,854
and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah

22
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:16,607
to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.

23
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,301
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know

24
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,709
it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.

25
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:23,627
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak

26
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,042
and wheat fields and vineyards.

27
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,421
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,

28
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:33,186
it's served, it's had a real strategic function,

29
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:36,099
and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies

30
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,682
on the coastal plain find their way,

31
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,304
get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.

32
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:45,331
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.

33
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:49,608
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies

34
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,110
of the Kingdom of Israel,

35
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,822
are living in the coastal plain.

36
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:56,118
They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.

37
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,541
And they may start to make their way

38
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,781
through one of the valleys of the Shephelah

39
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,948
up into the mountains,

40
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,204
because what they want to do is occupy the highland area

41
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:08,205
right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.

42
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:11,470
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,203
obviously catches wind of this,

44
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,072
and Saul brings his army down from the mountains

45
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,727
and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,

46
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:22,185
one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.

47
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,053
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,

48
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:29,310
and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,045
and the two armies just sit there for weeks

50
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:34,167
and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.

51
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,640
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,896
you've got to come down the mountain into the valley

53
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:42,413
and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.

54
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,605
So finally, to break the deadlock,

55
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,819
the Philistines send their mightiest warrior

56
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,296
down into the valley floor, and he calls out

57
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,752
and he says to the Israelites,

58
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:54,380
"Send your mightiest warrior down,

59
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,387
and we'll have this out, just the two of us."

60
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:00,222
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.

61
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,017
It was a way of settling disputes

62
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:06,141
without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.

63
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:09,101
And the Philistine who is sent down,

64
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,268
their mighty warrior, is a giant.

65
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,043
He's 6 foot 9.

66
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:17,756
He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,

67
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,815
and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin

68
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,543
and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.

69
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:28,033
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.

70
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,668
It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.

71
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,961
And finally the only person who will come forward

72
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,472
is this young shepherd boy,

73
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,150
and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."

74
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,268
And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.

75
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,590
You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."

76
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,013
But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,

77
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:51,006
you don't understand, I have been defending my flock

78
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:55,175
against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."

79
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:58,389
And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.

80
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,730
So he says, "All right."

81
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,942
And then he turns to the kid, and he says,

82
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:04,636
"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."

83
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,039
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,

84
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,290
and the shepherd says, "No."

85
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,703
He says, "I can't wear this stuff."

86
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:14,777
The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"

87
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,954
meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."

88
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:20,560
So he reaches down instead on the ground

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,315
and picks up five stones

90
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,776
and puts them in his shepherd's bag

91
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:29,288
and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.

92
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,494
And the giant sees this figure approaching,

93
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:34,637
and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh

94
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:38,614
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."

95
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:42,049
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person

96
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,784
coming to fight him.

97
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,130
And the shepherd draws closer and closer,

98
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,118
and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.

99
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:51,290
That's all he's carrying.

100
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,158
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,

101
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,730
and he says -- he's insulted --

102
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,087
"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"

103
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:02,150
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones

104
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,390
out of his pocket, puts it in his sling

105
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,685
and rolls it around and lets it fly

106
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:10,086
and it hits the giant right between the eyes --

107
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:12,184
right here, in his most vulnerable spot --

108
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:15,505
and he falls down either dead or unconscious,

109
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,999
and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword

110
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,685
and cuts off his head,

111
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:25,236
and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.

112
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:29,597
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath

113
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,126
and the name of the shepherd boy is David,

114
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,256
and the reason that story has obsessed me

115
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,694
over the course of writing my book

116
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,786
is that everything I thought I knew about that story

117
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:42,537
turned out to be wrong.

118
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:46,325
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?

119
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,462
In fact, that term, David and Goliath,

120
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,443
has entered our language as a metaphor for

121
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:52,981
improbable victories

122
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:56,092
by some weak party over someone far stronger.

123
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:58,282
Now why do we call David an underdog?

124
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:01,757
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,

125
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:05,293
a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.

126
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,948
We also call him an underdog

127
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:10,870
because Goliath is an experienced warrior,

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,806
and David is just a shepherd.

129
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,156
But most importantly, we call him an underdog

130
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:20,166
because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with

131
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,171
all of this modern weaponry,

132
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,947
this glittering coat of armor

133
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:27,782
and a sword and a javelin and a spear,

134
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:31,612
and all David has is this sling.

135
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:33,310
Well, let's start there with the phrase

136
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,754
"All David has is this sling,"

137
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,621
because that's the first mistake that we make.

138
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:42,178
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.

139
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:45,609
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.

140
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,735
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,

141
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,625
armed foot soldiers with swords and shields

142
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
and some kind of armor.

143
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,353
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,

144
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,525
but, more importantly, slingers.

145
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:01,586
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch

146
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:04,383
with two long cords attached to it,

147
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,585
and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,

148
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:10,706
inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this

149
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,349
and they let one of the cords go,

150
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,219
and the effect is to send the projectile forward

151
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:20,524
towards its target.

152
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,259
That's what David has, and it's important to understand

153
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,106
that that sling is not a slingshot.

154
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:28,725
It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.

155
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:32,550
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.

156
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,526
When David rolls it around like this,

157
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:38,755
he's turning the sling around probably

158
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:41,427
at six or seven revolutions per second,

159
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,272
and that means that when the rock is released,

160
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,472
it's going forward really fast,

161
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,245
probably 35 meters per second.

162
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:52,810
That's substantially faster than a baseball

163
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,443
thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.

164
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:00,326
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah

165
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,982
were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,

166
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,301
which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.

167
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,938
If you do the calculations on the ballistics,

168
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:12,822
on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,

169
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:15,143
it's roughly equal to the stopping power

170
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,700
of a [.45 caliber] handgun.

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,694
This is an incredibly devastating weapon.

172
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:26,292
Accuracy, we know from historical records

173
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:30,790
that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit

174
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,813
and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.

175
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,783
From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers

176
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,141
were capable of hitting birds in flight.

177
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,575
They were incredibly accurate.

178
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:48,132
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,

179
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,741
he's quite close to Goliath --

180
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,156
when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,

181
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,218
he has every intention and every expectation

182
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,921
of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot

183
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,249
between his eyes.

184
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,265
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,

185
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:05,077
you will find time and time again

186
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,080
that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry

187
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,105
in one kind of battle or another.

188
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:18,001
So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,

189
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:23,200
and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel

190
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,055
is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.

191
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,226
When he says, "Come to me that I might

192
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:32,178
feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

193
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:34,178
the key phrase is "Come to me."

194
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,316
Come up to me because we're going to fight,

195
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:38,027
hand to hand, like this.

196
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,155
Saul has the same expectation.

197
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,514
David says, "I want to fight Goliath,"

198
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,335
and Saul tries to give him his armor,

199
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,062
because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'

200
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:50,329
you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'

201
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,517
infantry on infantry."

202
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,491
But David has absolutely no expectation.

203
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,042
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?

204
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:01,050
He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career

205
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,263
using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.

206
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,013
That's where his strength lies.

207
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,545
So here he is, this shepherd, experienced

208
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:11,584
in the use of a devastating weapon,

209
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,978
up against this lumbering giant

210
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,278
weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor

211
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:18,779
and these incredibly heavy weapons

212
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,876
that are useful only in short-range combat.

213
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:26,613
Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.

214
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,419
So why do we keep calling David an underdog,

215
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:35,243
and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?

216
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:38,083
There's a second piece of this that's important.

217
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,481
It's not just that we misunderstand David

218
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,386
and his choice of weaponry.

219
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:46,725
It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.

220
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:49,959
Goliath is not what he seems to be.

221
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,947
There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,

222
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,752
things that are in retrospect quite puzzling

223
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:00,529
and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.

224
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,906
So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath

225
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:07,871
is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.

226
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,080
Now that is weird, right?

227
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,210
Here is this mighty warrior

228
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,017
challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.

229
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,729
Why is he being led by the hand

230
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,779
by some young boy, presumably,

231
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,241
to the point of combat?

232
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:27,595
Secondly, the Bible story makes special note

233
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:30,684
of how slowly Goliath moves,

234
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:32,710
another odd thing to say when you're describing

235
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,760
the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.

236
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,583
And then there's this whole weird thing

237
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,395
about how long it takes Goliath to react

238
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:44,391
to the sight of David.

239
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:47,169
So David's coming down the mountain,

240
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,106
and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.

241
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,074
There is nothing about him that says,

242
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:55,108
"I am about to fight you like this."

243
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,839
He's not even carrying a sword.

244
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,521
Why does Goliath not react to that?

245
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:03,749
It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.

246
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:07,696
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:

247
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:11,991
"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

248
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:15,814
Sticks? David only has one stick.

249
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,073
Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal

250
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:21,114
of speculation within the medical community over the years

251
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:23,640
about whether there is something

252
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,529
fundamentally wrong with Goliath,

253
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,938
an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.

254
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,100
There have been many articles written.

255
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,094
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,

256
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:37,449
and it started a chain of speculation

257
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,572
that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.

258
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:43,495
So Goliath is head and shoulders above

259
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:45,657
all of his peers in that era,

260
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:49,639
and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,

261
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,236
there's an explanation for it.

262
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,469
So the most common form of giantism

263
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,204
is a condition called acromegaly,

264
00:12:57,204 --> 00:13:00,107
and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor

265
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:02,610
on your pituitary gland

266
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,326
that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.

267
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,885
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants

268
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,654
have all had acromegaly.

269
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:12,718
So the tallest person of all time

270
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,285
was a guy named Robert Wadlow

271
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:17,336
who was still growing when he died at the age of 24

272
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:20,225
and he was 8 foot 11.

273
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:21,639
He had acromegaly.

274
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,174
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?

275
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,857
Famous. He had acromegaly.

276
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:30,396
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.

277
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:31,474
Anyone who's unusually tall,

278
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:34,227
that's the first explanation we come up with.

279
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:38,222
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects

280
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,447
associated with it,

281
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,009
principally having to do with vision.

282
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,305
The pituitary tumor, as it grows,

283
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:50,353
often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,

284
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:52,857
with the result that people with acromegaly

285
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:58,328
have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.

286
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,921
So when people have started to speculate

287
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:04,152
about what might have been wrong with Goliath,

288
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,063
they've said, "Wait a minute,

289
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:08,253
he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone

290
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:09,826
who has acromegaly."

291
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:12,810
And that would also explain so much of what was strange

292
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,937
about his behavior that day.

293
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,758
Why does he move so slowly

294
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:20,286
and have to be escorted down into the valley floor

295
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:21,645
by an attendant?

296
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:24,633
Because he can't make his way on his own.

297
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:27,890
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David

298
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,539
that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him

299
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,686
until the very last moment?

300
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:35,195
Because he can't see him.

301
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:38,512
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh

302
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,008
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"

303
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:45,652
the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.

304
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,636
Come to me because I can't see you.

305
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:53,850
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"

306
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,180
He sees two sticks when David has only one.

307
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,144
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge

308
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,341
looking down on him thought he was

309
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,452
this extraordinarily powerful foe.

310
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,428
What they didn't understand was that

311
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,725
the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength

312
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:16,480
was also the source of his greatest weakness.

313
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,437
And there is, I think, in that,

314
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:21,642
a very important lesson for all of us.

315
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:25,504
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.

316
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,993
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.

317
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,780
Thank you.

318
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,165
(Applause)
