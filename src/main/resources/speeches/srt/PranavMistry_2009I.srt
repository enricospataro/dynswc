1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,796
We grew up

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,796
interacting with the physical
objects around us.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,220
There are an enormous number of them
that we use every day.

4
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:23,796
Unlike most of our computing devices,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,073
these objects are much more fun to use.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,796
When you talk about objects,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,796
one other thing automatically
comes attached to that thing,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,796
and that is gestures:

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,796
how we manipulate these objects,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,796
how we use these objects in everyday life.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,796
We use gestures not only to interact
with these objects,

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,106
but we also use them
to interact with each other.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,796
A gesture of "Namaste!",
maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,249
in India I don't need to teach
a kid that this means

15
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:52,796
"four runs" in cricket.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,343
It comes as a part
of our everyday learning.

17
00:00:56,276 --> 00:00:59,796
So, I am very interested,
from the beginning,

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,796
how our knowledge
about everyday objects and gestures,

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,796
and how we use these objects,

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,796
can be leveraged to our interactions
with the digital world.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,796
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,796
why can I not use my computer

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,796
in the same way that I interact
in the physical world?

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,796
So, I started this exploration
around eight years back,

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,796
and it literally started
with a mouse on my desk.

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,796
Rather than using it for my computer,
I actually opened it.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,011
Most of you might be aware
that, in those days,

28
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:34,035
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,

29
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,796
and there were two rollers

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,796
that actually guide the computer
where the ball is moving,

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,916
and, accordingly,
where the mouse is moving.

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,796
So, I was interested in these two rollers,

33
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,201
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed
another mouse from a friend --

34
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,796
never returned to him --

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,796
and I now had four rollers.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,796
Interestingly, what I did
with these rollers is,

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,796
basically, I took them off of these mouses
and then put them in one line.

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,796
It had some strings
and pulleys and some springs.

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,796
What I got is basically
a gesture-interface device

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,796
that actually acts
as a motion-sensing device

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,796
made for two dollars.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,796
So, here, whatever movement
I do in my physical world

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,796
is actually replicated
inside the digital world

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,916
just using this small device
that I made, around eight years back,

45
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,796
in 2000.

46
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,487
Because I was interested
in integrating these two worlds,

47
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,796
I thought of sticky notes.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,796
I thought, "Why can I not connect

49
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,963
the normal interface
of a physical sticky note

50
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,796
to the digital world?"

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,968
A message written
on a sticky note to my mom,

52
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:36,196
on paper,

53
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,796
can come to an SMS,

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,796
or maybe a meeting reminder

55
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,011
automatically syncs
with my digital calendar --

56
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,796
a to-do list that automatically
syncs with you.

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,796
But you can also search
in the digital world,

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,796
or maybe you can write a query, saying,

59
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,796
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"

60
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,011
and this small system
actually prints it out --

61
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:56,512
so it actually acts like a paper
input-output system,

62
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,321
just made out of paper.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,796
In another exploration,

64
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,796
I thought of making a pen
that can draw in three dimensions.

65
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,796
So, I implemented this pen
that can help designers and architects

66
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,796
not only think in three dimensions,

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,796
but they can actually draw,

68
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,868
so that it's more intuitive
to use that way.

69
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,940
Then I thought,
"Why not make a Google Map,

70
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,796
but in the physical world?"

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,796
Rather than typing a keyword
to find something,

72
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,796
I put my objects on top of it.

73
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,011
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me
where the flight gate is.

74
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:31,796
A coffee cup will show
where you can find more coffee,

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,796
or where you can trash the cup.

76
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,796
So, these were some
of the earlier explorations I did

77
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
because the goal was to connect
these two worlds seamlessly.

78
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,796
Among all these experiments,

79
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,796
there was one thing in common:

80
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,325
I was trying to bring
a part of the physical world

81
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,847
to the digital world.

82
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,796
I was taking some part of the objects,

83
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,797
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,

84
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,010
and bringing them to the digital world,

85
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:01,059
because the goal was to make
our computing interfaces more intuitive.

86
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:05,796
But then I realized that we humans
are not actually interested in computing.

87
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,796
What we are interested in is information.

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,796
We want to know about things.

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,201
We want to know about
dynamic things going around.

90
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:17,796
So I thought, around last year --
in the beginning of the last year --

91
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,297
I started thinking, "Why can I not take
this approach in the reverse way?"

92
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,996
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world

93
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,796
and paint the physical world
with that digital information?"

94
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:33,596
Because pixels are actually, right now,
confined in these rectangular devices

95
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,367
that fit in our pockets.

96
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,796
Why can I not remove this confine

97
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,796
and take that to my everyday
objects, everyday life

98
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,963
so that I don't need
to learn the new language

99
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,784
for interacting with those pixels?

100
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,796
So, in order to realize this dream,

101
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,796
I actually thought of putting
a big-size projector on my head.

102
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,059
I think that's why this is called
a head-mounted projector, isn't it?

103
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,796
I took it very literally,

104
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,796
and took my bike helmet,

105
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,201
put a little cut over there so that
the projector actually fits nicely.

106
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,796
So now, what I can do --

107
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,625
I can augment the world around me
with this digital information.

108
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:09,696
But later,

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,879
I realized that I actually
wanted to interact

110
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,496
with those digital pixels, also.

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,796
So I put a small camera over there
that acts as a digital eye.

112
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,796
Later, we moved to a much better,

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
consumer-oriented pendant version of that,

114
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:23,796
that many of you now know
as the SixthSense device.

115
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,796
But the most interesting thing
about this particular technology

116
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,796
is that you can carry
your digital world with you

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,796
wherever you go.

118
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,796
You can start using any surface,
any wall around you,

119
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,796
as an interface.

120
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,796
The camera is actually tracking
all your gestures.

121
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,796
Whatever you're doing with your hands,

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,796
it's understanding that gesture.

123
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,396
And, actually, if you see,
there are some color markers

124
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,896
that in the beginning version
we are using with it.

125
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,796
You can start painting on any wall.

126
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,796
You stop by a wall,
and start painting on that wall.

127
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,963
But we are not only tracking
one finger, here.

128
00:05:56,987 --> 00:06:00,796
We are giving you the freedom
of using all of both of your hands,

129
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,963
so you can actually use both of your hands
to zoom into or zoom out

130
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,963
of a map just by pinching all present.

131
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:09,796
The camera is actually doing --
just, getting all the images --

132
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,796
is doing the edge recognition
and also the color recognition

133
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,796
and so many other small algorithms
are going on inside.

134
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
So, technically,
it's a little bit complex,

135
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,320
but it gives you an output which is more
intuitive to use, in some sense.

136
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:24,196
But I'm more excited that you can
actually take it outside.

137
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,796
Rather than getting your camera
out of your pocket,

138
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,796
you can just do the gesture
of taking a photo,

139
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,796
and it takes a photo for you.

140
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,796
(Applause)

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Thank you.

142
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,796
And later I can find a wall, anywhere,

143
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,796
and start browsing those photos

144
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,496
or maybe, "OK, I want to modify
this photo a little bit

145
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,506
and send it as an email to a friend."

146
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,796
So, we are looking for an era

147
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,796
where computing will actually merge
with the physical world.

148
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,796
And, of course,
if you don't have any surface,

149
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,796
you can start using your palm
for simple operations.

150
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,297
Here, I'm dialing a phone number
just using my hand.

151
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,796
The camera is actually not
only understanding your hand movements,

152
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,996
but, interestingly,

153
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,259
is also able to understand what objects
you are holding in your hand.

154
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,796
For example, in this case,

155
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,796
the book cover is matched

156
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,796
with so many thousands,
or maybe millions of books online,

157
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,796
and checking out which book it is.

158
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,296
Once it has that information,

159
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,196
it finds out more reviews about that,

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,796
or maybe New York Times
has a sound overview on that,

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,916
so you can actually hear,
on a physical book,

162
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,796
a review as sound.

163
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,996
(Video) Famous talk
at Harvard University --

164
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,796
This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.

165
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,285
(Video) And particularly I want
to thank two outstanding MIT --

166
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,343
Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing
the live [video] of his talk,

167
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,309
outside, on just a newspaper.

168
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,796
Your newspaper will show you
live weather information

169
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,426
rather than having it updated.

170
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,297
You have to check your computer
in order to do that, right?

171
00:07:56,321 --> 00:08:00,796
(Applause)

172
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,796
When I'm going back,
I can just use my boarding pass

173
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,916
to check how much my flight
has been delayed,

174
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,796
because at that particular time,

175
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,796
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,

176
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,796
and checking out a particular icon.

177
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,954
And I think this technology
will not only change the way --

178
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:15,954
(Laughter)

179
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:16,996
Yes.

180
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,498
It will change the way
we interact with people, also,

181
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,037
not only the physical world.

182
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,796
The fun part is, I'm going
to the Boston metro,

183
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,796
and playing a pong game inside the train
on the ground, right?

184
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,896
(Laughter)

185
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,016
And I think the imagination
is the only limit

186
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,796
of what you can think of

187
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,296
when this kind of technology
merges with real life.

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,196
But many of you argue, actually,

189
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,896
that all of our work is not
only about physical objects.

190
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,896
We actually do lots
of accounting and paper editing

191
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,211
and all those kinds of things;
what about that?

192
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,796
And many of you are excited
about the next-generation tablet computers

193
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,796
to come out in the market.

194
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,796
So, rather than waiting for that,

195
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,796
I actually made my own,
just using a piece of paper.

196
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
So, what I did here
is remove the camera --

197
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:02,796
All the webcam cameras have
a microphone inside the camera.

198
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,796
I removed the microphone from that,

199
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,796
and then just pinched that --

200
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,796
like I just made a clip
out of the microphone --

201
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,796
and clipped that to a piece of paper,
any paper that you found around.

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,796
So now the sound of the touch

203
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,796
is getting me when exactly
I'm touching the paper.

204
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,796
But the camera is actually tracking
where my fingers are moving.

205
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,796
You can of course watch movies.

206
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,796
(Video) Good afternoon.
My name is Russell,

207
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,796
and I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54."

208
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,796
PM: And you can of course play games.

209
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,796
(Car engine)

210
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,154
Here, the camera is actually understanding
how you're holding the paper

211
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,796
and playing a car-racing game.

212
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
(Applause)

213
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,994
Many of you already must have
thought, OK, you can browse.

214
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,296
Yeah. Of course you can
browse to any websites

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,996
or you can do all sorts
of computing on a piece of paper

216
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,196
wherever you need it.

217
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,796
So, more interestingly,

218
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,796
I'm interested in how we can
take that in a more dynamic way.

219
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,796
When I come back to my desk,
I can just pinch that information

220
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,796
back to my desktop

221
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,796
so I can use my full-size computer.

222
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,796
(Applause)

223
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,796
And why only computers?
We can just play with papers.

224
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,796
Paper world is interesting to play with.

225
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,796
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,

226
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,796
and putting over here a second part
from a second place,

227
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,796
and I'm actually modifying the information
that I have over there.

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,796
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,
let me print it out, that thing."

229
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,201
So I now have a print-out of that thing.

230
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:40,549
So the workflow is more intuitive,

231
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,796
the way we used to do it
maybe 20 years back,

232
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,796
rather than now switching
between these two worlds.

233
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,796
So, as a last thought,

234
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,196
I think that integrating
information to everyday objects

235
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,796
will not only help us to get rid
of the digital divide,

236
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,796
the gap between these two worlds,

237
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,796
but will also help us, in some way,

238
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,796
to stay human,

239
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
to be more connected
to our physical world.

240
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,796
And it will actually help us
not end up being machines

241
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,538
sitting in front of other machines.

242
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,796
That's all. Thank you.

243
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:31,796
(Applause)

244
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,996
Thank you.

245
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,796
(Applause)

246
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,796
Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,
first of all, you're a genius.

247
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,796
This is incredible, really.

248
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,920
What are you doing with this?
Is there a company being planned?

249
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,796
Or is this research forever, or what?

250
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,096
Pranav Mistry: So, there are
lots of companies,

251
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,116
sponsor companies of Media Lab
interested in taking this ahead

252
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,326
in one or another way.

253
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,323
Companies like mobile-phone operators

254
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:59,221
want to take this in a different way
than the NGOs in India,

255
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:01,421
thinking, "Why can we only
have 'Sixth Sense'?

256
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:04,896
We should have a 'Fifth Sense'
for missing-sense people who cannot speak.

257
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,211
This technology can be used for them
to speak out in a different way

258
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,511
maybe a speaker system."

259
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,996
CA: What are your own plans?
Are you staying at MIT,

260
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,096
or are you going to do
something with this?

261
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,649
PM: I'm trying to make this
more available to people

262
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:19,349
so that anyone can develop
their own SixthSense device,

263
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:22,796
because the hardware is actually
not that hard to manufacture

264
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,796
or hard to make your own.

265
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,392
We will provide all the open source
software for them,

266
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,796
maybe starting next month.

267
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,796
CA: Open source? Wow.

268
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,796
(Applause)

269
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,249
CA: Are you going to come back to India
with some of this, at some point?

270
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,796
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.

271
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,796
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,296
How are you going to split
your time going forward?

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,796
PM: There is a lot of energy here.
Lots of learning.

274
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,796
All of this work that you have seen
is all about my learning in India.

275
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,796
And now, if you see, it's more about
the cost-effectiveness:

276
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,796
this system costs you $300

277
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,796
compared to the $20,000 surface tables,
or anything like that.

278
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,796
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system
at that time was costing around $5,000?

279
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,796
I showed that, at a conference,
to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,

280
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,344
and then he said, "OK, we should use this
in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre

281
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,796
for some use of that."

282
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,916
So I'm excited about how I can bring
the technology to the masses

283
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,940
rather than just keeping that technology
in the lab environment.

284
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:26,796
(Applause)

285
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,938
CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,

286
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:31,296
I would say you're truly
one of the two or three

287
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,196
best inventors in the world right now.

288
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,796
It's an honor to have you at TED.

289
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,796
Thank you so much.

290
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,996
That's fantastic.

291
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,820
(Applause)
