00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
and the phone rang and I heard,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
"Hey, JR,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
you won the TED Prize 2011.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
You have to make a wish to save the world."

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I was lost.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
The world is fucked up.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
population is growing by millions,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
there's no more fish in the sea,

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
the North Pole is melting

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
we're all becoming fat.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
(Laughter)

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Except maybe French people.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Whatever.

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
So I called back

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
and I told her,

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
"Look, Amy,

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
I can't do anything to save the world."

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
She said, "Hey, JR,

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
"Oh, all right."

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
(Laughter)

27
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
"That's cool."

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
I mean, technology, politics, business

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
do change the world --

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
not always in a good way, but they do.

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
What about art?

32
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
Could art change the world?

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I started when I was 15 years old.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
I was doing graffiti --

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
writing my name everywhere,

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
using the city as a canvas.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,

39
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
on the rooftops with my friends.

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Each trip was an excursion,

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
was an adventure.

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
It was like leaving our mark on society,

43
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
I started documenting those adventures with my friends

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
and gave them back as photocopies --

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
really small photos just that size.

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
That's how, at 17 years old,

49
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
I started pasting them.

50
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And I did my first "expo de rue,"

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
which means sidewalk gallery.

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
And I framed it with color

53
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
so you would not confuse it with advertising.

54
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.

55
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery

56
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
and let them decide

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.

58
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
I would control it directly with the public

59
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
in the streets.

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
So that's Paris.

61
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
I would change --

62
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
depending on the places I would go --

63
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
the title of the exhibition.

64
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
That's on the Champs-Elysees.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
I was quite proud of that one.

66
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Because I was just 18

67
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.

68
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Then when the photo left,

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
the frame was still there.

70
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
(Laughter)

71
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
November 2005:

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
the streets are burning.

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
A large wave of riots

74
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
had broken into the first projects of Paris.

75
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Everyone was glued to the TV,

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,820
watching disturbing, frightening images

77
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.

78
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
I mean, these kids, without control,

79
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
throwing Molotov cocktails,

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
attacking the cops and the firemen,

81
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
looting everything they could in the shops.

82
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,

83
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
destroying their own environment.

84
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
my photo on a wall

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
revealed by a burning car --

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
an illegal one -- still there.

89
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.

90
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
I know those guys.

91
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
All of them are not angels,

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
but they're not monsters either.

93
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
So it was kind of weird to see

94
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,820
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.

95
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So I went back there

96
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
with a 28 mm lens.

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
It was the only one I had at that time.

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
But with that lens,

99
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
So you can do it only with their trust.

101
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,820
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
They were making scary faces

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
to play the caricature of themselves.

104
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere

105
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
in the bourgeois area of Paris

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
with the name, age, even building number

107
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
of these guys.

108
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
A year later,

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
And we go from thug images,

111
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
who's now proudly taking over his own image.

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
That's where I realized

114
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
the power of paper and glue.

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
So could art change the world?

116
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
A year later,

117
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
I was listening to all the noise

118
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
about the Middle East conflict.

119
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
I mean, at that time, trust me,

120
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

121
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
So with my friend Marco,

122
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
we decided to go there

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.

124
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Are they so different?

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
When we got there, we just went in the street,

126
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
started talking with people everywhere,

127
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
and we realized that things were a bit different

128
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.

129
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
So we decided to take portraits

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
of Palestinians and Israelis

131
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
doing the same jobs --

132
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.

134
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell

135
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
about who you are and what you feel.

136
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
They all accepted

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
to be pasted next to the other.

138
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
I decided to paste

139
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,820
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities

140
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
and on both sides of the wall.

141
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.

142
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
We called the project Face 2 Face.

143
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
The experts said, "No way.

144
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
The people will not accept.

145
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."

146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."

147
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
I love the way that people will ask me,

148
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
"How big will my photo be?"

149
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
"It will be as big as your house."

150
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.

151
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
So we arrived with just our ladders

152
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
and we realized that they were not high enough.

153
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
And so Palestinians guys say,

154
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."

155
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
So he went to the Church of Nativity

156
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
and brought back an old ladder

157
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.

158
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
(Laughter)

159
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,

160
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
two ladders, two brushes,

161
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
a rented car, a camera

162
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
and 20,000 square feet of paper.

163
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
We had all sorts of help

164
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
from all walks of life.

165
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.

166
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
We're in Ramallah right now.

167
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
We're pasting portraits --

168
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.

169
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
People come around us and start asking,

170
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
"What are you doing here?"

171
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project

172
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."

174
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
And then there was always a silence.

175
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --

176
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
doing a face -- right here?"

177
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."

178
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
And I would always leave that moment,

179
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
and we would ask them,

180
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
"So can you tell me who is who?"

181
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
And most of them couldn't say.

182
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,820
(Applause)

183
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,

184
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
and nothing happened.

185
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.

186
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --

187
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
some are a bit high for that, I agree --

188
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
but the people in the street,

189
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
they are the curator.

190
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.

191
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
They are not meant to stay.

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
But exactly four years after,

193
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
the photos, most of them are still there.

194
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Face 2 Face demonstrated

195
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
that what we thought impossible was possible --

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
and, you know what, even easy.

197
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
We didn't push the limit;

198
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

199
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
In the Middle East, I experienced my work

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
in places without [many] museums.

201
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
So the reactions in the street

202
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
were kind of interesting.

203
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
So I decided to go further in this direction

204
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,820
and go in places where there were zero museums.

205
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
When you go in these developing societies,

206
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
women are the pillars of their community,

207
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.

208
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
So we were inspired to create a project

209
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
where men will pay tribute to women

210
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
by posting their photos.

211
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,820
I called that project Women Are Heroes.

212
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
When I listened to all the stories

213
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
everywhere I went on the continents,

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
I couldn't always understand

215
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.

216
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I just observed.

217
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Sometimes there was no words,

218
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
no sentence, just tears.

219
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
I just took their pictures

220
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
and pasted them.

221
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.

222
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Most of the places I went to,

223
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
I decided to go there

224
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
because I've heard about it through the media.

225
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
So for example, in June 2008,

226
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
I was watching TV in Paris,

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
and then I heard about this terrible thing

228
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --

229
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,820
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.

230
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Three kids -- that was three students --

231
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
were [detained] by the army

232
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
because they were not carrying their papers.

233
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And the army took them,

234
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
and instead of bringing them to the police station,

235
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
they brought them to an enemy favela

236
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
where they get chopped into pieces.

237
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I was shocked.

238
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
All Brazil was shocked.

239
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,

240
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
because the largest drug cartel controls it.

241
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
So I decided to go there.

242
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
When I arrived --

243
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.

244
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --

245
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
no eyewitnesses.

246
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
So we just walked around,

247
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
and we met a woman,

248
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
and I showed her my book.

249
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
And she said, "You know what?

250
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
We're hungry for culture.

251
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
We need culture out there."

252
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
So I went out and I started with the kids.

253
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
I just took a few photos of the kids,

254
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.

255
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.

256
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
But that's okay.

257
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.

258
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square

259
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
and some women came.

260
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.

261
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
they all wanted to shout the story.

263
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
After that day,

264
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.

265
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
I took more photos, and we started the project.

266
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
The drug lords were kind of worried

267
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
about us filming in the place,

268
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
so I told them, "You know what?

269
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.

270
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
You see that enough in the media.

271
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.

272
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."

273
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
So that's a really symbolic pasting,

274
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.

275
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And that's where the three kids got arrested,

276
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
and that's the grandmother of one of them.

277
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
And on that stairs,

278
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
that's where the traffickers always stand

279
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.

280
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Everyone there understood the project.

281
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.

282
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:52,820
(Applause)

283
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.

284
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I mean, you should see that.

285
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter

286
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
and then have a really long lens,

287
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.

288
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
And they would put a number: "Please call this number

289
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
if you know what's going on in Providencia."

290
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
We just did a project and then left

291
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
so the media wouldn't know.

292
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
So how can we know about the project?

293
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
So they had to go and find the women

294
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
and get an explanation from them.

295
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
So you create a bridge between the media

296
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
and the anonymous women.

297
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
We kept traveling.

298
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,

299
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Liberia, Kenya.

300
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
In war-torn places like Monrovia,

301
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
people come straight to you.

302
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.

303
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?

304
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"

305
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Art. Just doing art.

306
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

307
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Don't you have color in France?"

308
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
(Laughter)

309
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"

310
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.

311
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,

312
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
"You know, you've been here for a few hours

313
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.

314
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
During that time, you haven't thought about

315
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
what you're going to eat tomorrow.

316
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
This is art."

317
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
I think it's people's curiosity

318
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
that motivates them

319
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
to come into the projects.

320
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
And then it becomes more.

321
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.

322
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,

323
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait

324
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.

325
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Women are always the first ones targeted

326
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
during conflict.

327
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
This is Kibera, Kenya,

328
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
one of the largest slums of Africa.

329
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
You might have seen images about the post-election violence

330
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
that happened there in 2008.

331
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,

332
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
but we didn't use paper,

333
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
because paper doesn't prevent the rain

334
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
from leaking inside the house --

335
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
vinyl does.

336
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Then art becomes useful.

337
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
So the people kept it.

338
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,

339
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
there are so [many] houses inside.

340
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
And I went there a few months ago --

341
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.

342
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
So I asked the people what happened.

343
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
"Oh, that guy just moved."

344
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
(Laughter)

345
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,

346
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
"Now God can see me."

347
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
When you look at Kibera now,

348
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
they look back.

349
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Okay, India.

350
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Before I start that, just so you know,

351
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,

352
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
so we set up like commandos --

353
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
we're a group of friends who arrive there,

354
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
and we try to paste on the walls.

355
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.

356
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
In India it was just impossible to paste.

357
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I heard culturally and because of the law,

358
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.

359
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
So we decided to paste white,

360
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
white on the walls.

361
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.

362
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
So people would come to us and ask us,

363
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
"Hey, what are you up to?"

364
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"

365
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Of course, they were confused.

366
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,

367
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
and the more dust you would have

368
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
going up in the air,

369
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
on the white paper you can almost see,

370
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
but there is this sticky part

371
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
like when you reverse a sticker.

372
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.

373
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
So we could just walk in the street during the next days

374
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.

375
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,820
(Applause)

376
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Thank you.

377
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
So we didn't get caught this time.

378
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Each project -- that's a film

379
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
from Women Are Heroes.

380
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
(Music)

381
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Okay.

382
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
For each project we do

383
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
a film.

384
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --

385
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
its images, photography,

386
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
taken one after the other.

387
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
And the photos kept traveling even without us.

388
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
(Laughter)

389
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:29,820
(Applause)

390
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Hopefully, you'll see the film,

391
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
and you'll understand the scope of the project

392
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.

393
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.

394
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Behind each image is a story.

395
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic

396
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
in each of the communities,

397
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,820
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.

398
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
For example, we did books -- not for sale --

399
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
that all the community would get.

400
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,820
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.

401
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
We did that in most of the places.

402
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
We go back regularly.

403
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,820
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,

404
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
we have a cultural center running there.

405
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.

406
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project

407
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"

408
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
So we decided to come the year after

409
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
and keep doing the project.

410
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
A really important point for me

411
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.

412
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
So I have no responsibility

413
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
to anyone but myself

414
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
and the subjects.

415
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,820
(Applause)

416
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
And that is for me

417
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
one of the more important things in the work.

418
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
I think, today,

419
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,820
as important as the result is the way you do things.

420
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,820
And that has always been a central part of the work.

421
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have

422
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
with images and advertising.

423
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles

424
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
on another project in the last weeks.

425
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,820
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.

426
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
But yesterday the city called them and said,

427
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.

428
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
Because this can be taken for advertising,

429
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
and because of the law,

430
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
it has to be taken down."

431
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,820
But tell me, advertising for what?

432
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
The people I photograph

433
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
were proud to participate in the project

434
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
and to have their photo in the community.

435
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
But they asked me for a promise basically.

436
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,820
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."

437
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
So I did. That's Paris.

438
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
That's Rio.

439
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,820
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.

440
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
You understand the full scope of the project.

441
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
That's London.

442
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
New York.

443
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.

444
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,820
All right, recently I started a public art project

445
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
where I don't use my artwork anymore.

446
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,

447
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.

448
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,820
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.

449
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
The importance is what you do

450
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
with the images,

451
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,820
the statement it makes where it's pasted.

452
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,820
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret

453
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
in Switzerland

454
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,820
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.

455
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,820
(Applause)

456
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
This image of three men wearing gas masks

457
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
was taken in Chernobyl originally,

458
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,

459
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,820
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.

460
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,820
In some ways, art can change the world.

461
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
Art is not supposed to change the world,

462
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
to change practical things,

463
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
but to change perceptions.

464
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
Art can change

465
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
the way we see the world.

466
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Art can create an analogy.

467
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Actually the fact that art cannot change things

468
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,820
makes it a neutral place

469
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,820
for exchanges and discussions,

470
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,820
and then enables you to change the world.

471
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,820
When I do my work,

472
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
I have two kinds of reactions.

473
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,820
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.

474
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
They would be really useful."

475
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Or, "How can we help?"

476
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,820
I presume that you belong to the second category,

477
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
and that's good,

478
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
because for that project,

479
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
I'm going to ask you to take the photos

480
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,820
and paste them.

481
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
So now my wish is:

482
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
(mock drum roll)

483
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
(Laughter)

484
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
I wish for you to stand up

485
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,820
for what you care about

486
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,820
by participating in a global art project,

487
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,820
and together we'll turn the world inside out.

488
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
And this starts right now.

489
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Yes, everyone in the room.

490
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Everyone watching.

491
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
I wanted that wish

492
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
to actually start now.

493
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story

494
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
or even your own photos --

495
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
tell me what you stand for.

496
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Take the photos, the portraits,

497
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,820
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --

498
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,820
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups

499
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,820
and reveal things to the world.

500
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,820
The full data is on the website --

501
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
insideoutproject.net --

502
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,820
that is launching today.

503
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
What we see changes who we are.

504
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
When we act together,

505
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,820
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.

506
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
So I hope that, together, we'll create something

507
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
that the world will remember.

508
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,820
And this starts right now and depends on you.

509
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Thank you.

510
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,820
(Applause)

511
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Thank you.

512
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:58,820
(Applause)
