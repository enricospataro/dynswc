1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I run a design studio in New York.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Every seven years, I close it for one year

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
to pursue

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
some little experiments, things that

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
are always difficult to accomplish

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
during the regular working year.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
In that year, we are not available

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
for any of our clients.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
We are totally closed.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
And as you can imagine,

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,820
it is a lovely and very energetic time.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I originally had opened the studio in New York

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
to combine my two loves, music and design.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
And we created videos and packaging

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
for many musicians that you know,

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
and for even more that you've never heard of.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,820
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
that I actually love,

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
I adapt to it.

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And I get, over time, bored by them.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
And for sure, in our case,

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
our work started to look the same.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,820
in a book, in a die cut.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,820
So I decided to close it down for one year.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Also is the knowledge that

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
right now we spend about

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,820
in the first 25 years of our lives learning,

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
then there is another 40 years

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
that's really reserved for working.

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
And then tacked on at the end of it

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
are about 15 years for retirement.

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
And I thought it might be helpful

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
to basically cut off five of those retirement years

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,820
and intersperse them in between those working years.

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,820
(Applause)

38
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
That's clearly enjoyable for myself.

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
But probably even more important is

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
that the work that comes out of these years

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
flows back into the company

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and into society at large,

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:21,820
rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.

44
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Jonathan Haidt,

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
who defined his work into three different levels.

47
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
And they rang very true for me.

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,820
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.

51
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
In a career I'm definitely more engaged.

52
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
But at the same time, there will be periods when I think

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
is all that really hard work really worth my while?

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
While in the third one, in the calling,

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
very much likely I would do it also

56
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,820
if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.

57
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I am not a religious person myself,

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
but I did look for nature.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.

60
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
Looked for something different for the second one.

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
were Sri Lanka and Bali.

65
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.

66
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.

67
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,820
I arrived there in September 2008,

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
and pretty much started to work right away.

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,820
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.

70
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
However the first thing that I needed was

71
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
mosquito repellent typography

72
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
because they were definitely around heavily.

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
And then I needed some sort of way

74
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs

75
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
that surround my house,

76
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
and attacked me during my morning walks.

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,820
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Every single dog on one tee shirt.

79
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
As a little retaliation

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,820
with a just ever so slightly menacing message

81
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
(Laughter)

82
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
on the back of the shirt.

83
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
(Laughter)

84
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Just before I left New York

85
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
I decided I could actually renovate my studio.

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
And then just leave it all to them.

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
And I don't have to do anything.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
So I looked for furniture.

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
And it turned out that

90
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
all the furniture that I really liked,

91
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I couldn't afford.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.

93
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali

94
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
was pieces of furniture.

95
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
It's not quite finished yet.

97
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
And I think by the time this lamp came about,

98
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
(Laughter)

99
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,820
I had finally made peace with those dogs.

100
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,820
(Laughter)

101
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.

102
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
It's called Be Here Now.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
It includes 330 compasses.

104
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
And we had custom espresso cups made

105
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
that hide a magnet inside,

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
and make those compasses go crazy,

107
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
always centering on them.

108
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.

109
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,820
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.

110
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,820
how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
So I will not really go too far into it.

113
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
Many of you will know this TEDster,

114
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,

115
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
I got it through the TED book club.

116
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I think it took me four years

117
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,820
to finally read it, while on sabbatical.

118
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And I was pleased to see

119
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.

120
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
And I'll show you a couple of people

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,820
that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.

122
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
This is Ferran Adria. Many people think

123
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
he is right now the best chef in the world

124
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.

125
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
His restaurant is open seven months every year.

126
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
He closes it down for five months

127
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
to experiment with a full kitchen staff.

128
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,820
He can seat, throughout the year,

130
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
he can seat 8,000 people.

131
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,820
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.

132
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
it's 12.5 percent of my time.

134
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,820
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,

135
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
3M since the 1930s

136
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
is giving all their engineers

137
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,820
15 percent to pursue whatever they want.

138
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
There is some good successes.

139
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Scotch tape came out of this program,

140
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,820
as well as Art Fry developed

141
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.

142
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Google, of course, very famously

143
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
gives 20 percent for their software engineers

144
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,820
to pursue their own personal projects.

145
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?

146
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,820
That's about five percent of everybody.

147
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,820
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.

148
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Talk to them about if it was successful or not.

149
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
I've found that

150
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,820
finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,

151
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
my very best way is to talk to people

152
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
who have actually done it

153
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,820
much better than myself envisioning it.

154
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
When I had the idea of doing one,

155
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,820
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.

156
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,820
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it

157
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.

158
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
(Laughter)

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,

160
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,820
it was rather disastrous.

161
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
I had thought that I should do this without any plan,

162
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,820
that this vacuum of time somehow would

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
be wonderful and enticing

164
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
for idea generation. It was not.

165
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I just, without a plan, I just reacted

166
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
to little requests, not work requests,

167
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
those I all said no to, but other little requests.

168
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.

169
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
So I became my own intern.

170
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
(Laughter)

171
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
And I very quickly

172
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
made a list of the things I was interested in,

173
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,820
put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time

174
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,820
and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.

175
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,820
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;

176
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
9 to 10: future thinking.

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.

178
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
And that actually, specifically as a starting point

179
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.

180
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
What came out of it?

181
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
I really got close to design again.

182
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I had fun.

183
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.

184
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.

185
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
And probably most importantly,

186
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
basically everything we've done

187
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
in the seven years following the first sabbatical

188
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,820
came out of thinking of that one single year.

189
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
And I'll show you a couple of projects

190
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,820
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.

191
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was

192
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
that sameness is so incredibly overrated.

193
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,820
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same

194
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
works for a very very few strand of companies,

195
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and not for everybody else.

196
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,820
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,

197
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
the Rem Koolhaas-built music center

198
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
in Porto, in Portugal.

199
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And even though I desired to do an identity

200
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,820
that doesn't use the architecture,

201
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
I failed at that.

202
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And mostly also because I realized

203
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where

204
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,820
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.

205
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Which I understood after I

206
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
translated it from architecture speech

207
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
in to regular English,

208
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
basically as logo making.

209
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.

210
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
So then it became quite easy.

211
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
We put a mask on it,

212
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
looked at it deep down in the ground,

213
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
checked it out from all sides,

214
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
west, north, south, east,

215
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
top and bottom.

216
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Colored them in a very particular way

217
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,

218
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.

219
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
That's connected to a scanner.

220
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.

221
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
And the software, in a second,

222
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.

223
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,

224
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,820
comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo

225
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
and the actual poster is exactly the same.

226
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,820
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.

227
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,820
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.

228
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
who all performed there, get their own

230
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Casa da Musica logo.

231
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,

232
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,820
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.

233
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
There is a full-blown orchestra

234
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
living inside the building.

235
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,820
It has a more transparent identity.

236
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
The truck they go on tour with.

237
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,

238
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,820
12 people that remixes its own title.

239
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
And one of the handy things that came about

240
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
was that you could take the logo type

241
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
and create advertising out of it.

242
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Like this Donna Toney poster,

243
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
or Chopin, or Mozart,

244
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
or La Monte Young.

245
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,820
You can take the shape and make typography out of it.

246
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
You can grow it underneath the skin.

247
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,

248
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
or a rave underneath the house

249
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
or a weekly program,

250
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,820
as well as educational services.

251
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Second insight. So far, until that point I had

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
been mostly involved

253
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
or used the language of design

254
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
for promotional purposes,

255
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
which was fine with me.

256
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
On one hand I have nothing against selling.

257
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
My parents are both salespeople.

258
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
But I did feel that

259
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
I spent so much time learning this language,

260
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
why do I only promote with it?

261
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
There must be something else.

262
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
And the whole series of work came out of it.

263
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Some of you might have seen it.

264
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
I showed some of it

265
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
at earlier TEDs before,

266
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."

267
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
I'll just show two now.

268
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
This is a whole wall of bananas

269
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
at different ripenesses

270
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
on the opening day in this gallery in New York.

271
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,820
It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."

272
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
This is after a week.

273
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
After two weeks,

274
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
And you see the self confidence almost comes back,

276
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,820
but not quite.

277
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.

278
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
(Laughter)

279
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
And then the city of Amsterdam

280
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.

281
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
We used the stone plates as a grid

282
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
for our little piece.

283
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,

284
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
at different darknesses.

285
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,

286
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,820
medium ones, and very old, dark ones.

287
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,820
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,

288
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,820
created this fairly floral typography

289
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse

290
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
and my work better."

291
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And the idea of course was to

292
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
make the type so precious

293
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
that as an audience

294
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
you would be in between,

295
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
"Should I really take as much money as I can?

296
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,820
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"

297
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
While we built all this up

298
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
during that week, with the 100 volunteers,

299
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,820
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza

300
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
got very close to it and quite loved it.

301
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
So when it was finally done,

302
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
and in the first night

303
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
a guy came with big plastic bags

304
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,820
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,

305
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
one of the neighbors called the police.

306
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
And the Amsterdam police

307
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
in all their wisdom,

308
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
came, saw,

309
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
and they wanted to protect the artwork.

310
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
And they swept it all up and put it into custody

311
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
at police headquarters.

312
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
(Laughter)

313
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.

314
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
That's the police, getting rid of it all.

315
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
So after eight hours

316
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
that's pretty much all that was left

317
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
of the whole thing.

318
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
(Laughter)

319
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.

320
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
It's a movie about happiness.

321
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
And here we asked some nearby pigs

322
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
to do the titles for us.

323
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
They weren't quite slick enough.

324
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
So we asked the goose to do it again,

325
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
and hoped she would do somehow,

326
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
a more elegant or pretty job.

327
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
And I think she overdid it.

328
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Just a bit too ornamental.

329
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.

330
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
And the monkeys in that monkey forest

331
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
looked, actually, fairly happy.

332
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,820
So we asked those guys to do it again.

333
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
They did a fine job, but had

334
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,820
a couple of readability problems.

335
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself

336
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
doesn't really get done properly.

337
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,820
That film we'll be working on for the next two years.

338
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
So it's going to be a while.

339
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
And of course you might think that

340
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
doing a film on happiness

341
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
might not really be worthwhile.

342
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Then you can of course always

343
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
go and see this guy.

344
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Video: (Laughter)

345
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
And I'm happy I'm alive.

346
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.

347
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

348
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,820
(Applause)
