1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
A few months ago

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
the Nobel Prize in physics

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
was awarded to two teams of astronomers

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
for a discovery that has been hailed

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
as one of the most important

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
astronomical observations ever.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And today, after briefly describing what they found,

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
for explaining their discovery,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
namely the possibility

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
that way beyond the Earth,

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
we may find that our universe

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
is not the only universe,

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
but is instead

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
part of a vast complex of universes

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
that we call the multiverse.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I mean, most of us were raised to believe

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
that the word "universe" means everything.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
And I say most of us with forethought,

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
And last year I was holding her

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and I said, "Sophia,

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I love you more than anything in the universe."

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy,

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
universe or multiverse?"

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
(Laughter)

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
But barring such an anomalous upbringing,

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
it is strange to imagine

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
other realms separate from ours,

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
most with fundamentally different features,

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
that would rightly be called universes of their own.

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And yet,

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
speculative though the idea surely is,

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
I aim to convince you

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
that there's reason for taking it seriously,

38
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
as it just might be right.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
In part one,

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and to highlight a profound mystery

43
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
which those results revealed.

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
In part two,

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I'll offer a solution to that mystery.

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
It's based on an approach called string theory,

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
and that's where the idea of the multiverse

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
will come into the story.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Finally, in part three,

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm going to describe a cosmological theory

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
called inflation,

52
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
which will pull all the pieces of the story together.

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Okay, part one starts back in 1929

54
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
realized that the distant galaxies

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
were all rushing away from us,

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
establishing that space itself is stretching,

58
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
it's expanding.

59
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Now this was revolutionary.

60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
the universe was static.

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
But even so,

63
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
there was one thing that everyone was certain of:

64
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
The expansion must be slowing down.

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,

67
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
the gravitational pull

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
of each galaxy on every other

69
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
must be slowing

70
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
the expansion of space.

71
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
when those two teams of astronomers

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
I mentioned at the outset

74
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
were inspired by this reasoning

75
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
to measure the rate

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
at which the expansion has been slowing.

77
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
And they did this

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
by painstaking observations

79
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
of numerous distant galaxies,

80
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
allowing them to chart

81
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
how the expansion rate has changed over time.

82
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Here's the surprise:

83
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
They found that the expansion is not slowing down.

84
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
Instead they found that it's speeding up,

85
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
going faster and faster.

86
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
That's like tossing an apple upward

87
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
and it goes up faster and faster.

88
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Now if you saw an apple do that,

89
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
you'd want to know why.

90
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
What's pushing on it?

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Similarly, the astronomers' results

92
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,

93
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
but they raised an analogous question.

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
What force is driving all galaxies

95
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
to rush away from every other

96
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
at an ever-quickening speed?

97
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Well the most promising answer

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
comes from an old idea of Einstein's.

99
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
You see, we are all used to gravity

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
being a force that does one thing,

101
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
pulls objects together.

102
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
But in Einstein's theory of gravity,

103
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
his general theory of relativity,

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
gravity can also push things apart.

105
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
How? Well according to Einstein's math,

106
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
if space is uniformly filled

107
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
with an invisible energy,

108
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,

109
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
then the gravity generated by that mist

110
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
would be repulsive,

111
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
repulsive gravity,

112
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
which is just what we need to explain the observations.

113
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Because the repulsive gravity

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
of an invisible energy in space --

115
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
we now call it dark energy,

116
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
its repulsive gravity

118
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
would cause each galaxy to push against every other,

119
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
driving expansion to speed up,

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
not slow down.

121
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And this explanation

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
represents great progress.

123
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
But I promised you a mystery

124
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
here in part one.

125
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Here it is.

126
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
When the astronomers worked out

127
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
how much of this dark energy

128
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
must be infusing space

129
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
to account for the cosmic speed up,

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
look at what they found.

131
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
This number is small.

132
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Expressed in the relevant unit,

133
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
it is spectacularly small.

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
We want this number

136
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
to emerge from the laws of physics,

137
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
but so far no one has found a way to do that.

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Now you might wonder,

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
should you care?

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Maybe explaining this number

141
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
is just a technical issue,

142
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
a technical detail of interest to experts,

143
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
but of no relevance to anybody else.

144
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Well it surely is a technical detail,

145
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
but some details really matter.

146
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Some details provide

147
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
windows into uncharted realms of reality,

148
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
and this peculiar number may be doing just that,

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
invokes the possibility of other universes --

151
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,

152
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
which takes me to part two: string theory.

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
So hold the mystery of the dark energy

154
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
in the back of your mind

155
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
as I now go on to tell you

156
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
three key things about string theory.

157
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
First off, what is it?

158
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream

159
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
of a unified theory of physics,

160
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
a single overarching framework

161
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
that would be able to describe

162
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
all the forces at work in the universe.

163
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
And the central idea of string theory

164
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
is quite straightforward.

165
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
It says that if you examine

166
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
any piece of matter ever more finely,

167
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
at first you'll find molecules

168
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.

169
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,

170
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
much smaller than we can with existing technology,

171
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
you'd find something else inside these particles --

172
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,

173
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
a little tiny vibrating string.

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
And just like the strings on a violin,

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
they can vibrate in different patterns

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
producing different musical notes.

177
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
These little fundamental strings,

178
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
when they vibrate in different patterns,

179
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
they produce different kinds of particles --

180
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,

181
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
all other particles

182
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
would be united into a single framework,

183
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
as they would all arise from vibrating strings.

184
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
It's a compelling picture,

185
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
a kind of cosmic symphony,

186
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
where all the richness

187
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
that we see in the world around us

188
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
emerges from the music

189
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
that these little, tiny strings can play.

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
But there's a cost

191
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
to this elegant unification,

192
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
because years of research

193
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.

194
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
It has internal inconsistencies,

195
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
unless we allow

196
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
for something wholly unfamiliar --

197
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
extra dimensions of space.

198
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.

199
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
And you can think about those

200
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
as height, width and depth.

201
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,

202
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
there are additional dimensions

203
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
crumpled to a tiny size so small

204
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
that we have not detected them.

205
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
But even though the dimensions are hidden,

206
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
they would have an impact on things that we can observe

207
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
because the shape of the extra dimensions

208
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
constrains how the strings can vibrate.

209
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
And in string theory,

210
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
vibration determines everything.

211
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
So particle masses, the strengths of forces,

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
and most importantly, the amount of dark energy

213
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
would be determined

214
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
by the shape of the extra dimensions.

215
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,

216
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
we should be able to calculate these features,

217
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
calculate the amount of dark energy.

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
The challenge

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
is we don't know

220
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
the shape of the extra dimensions.

221
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
All we have

222
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
is a list of candidate shapes

223
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
allowed by the math.

224
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Now when these ideas were first developed,

225
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
there were only about five different candidate shapes,

226
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
so you can imagine

227
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
analyzing them one-by-one

228
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
to determine if any yield

229
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
the physical features we observe.

230
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
But over time the list grew

231
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
as researchers found other candidate shapes.

232
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --

233
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,

234
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
since after all,

235
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
graduate students need something to do.

236
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
But then the list continued to grow

237
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
into the millions and the billions, until today.

238
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
The list of candidate shapes

239
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,820
has soared to about 10 to the 500.

240
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
So, what to do?

241
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Well some researchers lost heart,

242
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,

243
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
each giving rise to different physical features,

244
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
string theory would never make

245
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
definitive, testable predictions.

246
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
But others turned this issue on its head,

247
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.

248
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Here's the idea.

249
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.

250
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Each is as real as every other,

251
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
in the sense

252
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
that there are many universes,

253
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.

254
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
And this radical proposal

255
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
has a profound impact on this mystery:

256
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.

257
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Because you see,

258
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
if there are other universes,

259
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
and if those universes

260
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,

261
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
then the physical features of each universe will be different,

262
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
and in particular,

263
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
the amount of dark energy in each universe

264
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
will be different.

265
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Which means that the mystery

266
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured

267
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
would take on a wholly different character.

268
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
In this context,

269
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
because there isn't just one number,

271
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
there are many numbers.

272
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Which means

273
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
we have been asking the wrong question.

274
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
It's that the right question to ask is,

275
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
why do we humans find ourselves in a universe

276
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured

277
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
instead of any of the other possibilities

278
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
that are out there?

279
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
And that's a question on which we can make headway.

280
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Because those universes

281
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
that have much more dark energy than ours,

282
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,

283
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong

284
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
that it blows the clump apart

285
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
and galaxies don't form.

286
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
And in those universes that have much less dark energy,

287
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
well they collapse back on themselves so quickly

288
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
that, again, galaxies don't form.

289
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets

290
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
and no chance

291
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
for our form of life

292
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
to exist in those other universes.

293
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
So we find ourselves in a universe

294
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured

295
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
simply because our universe has conditions

296
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
hospitable to our form of life.

297
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
And that would be that.

298
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Mystery solved,

299
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
multiverse found.

300
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.

301
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
We're used to physics

302
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.

303
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
But the point is,

304
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
if the feature you're observing

305
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
can and does take on

306
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
a wide variety of different values

307
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
across the wider landscape of reality,

308
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
then thinking one explanation

309
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
for a particular value

310
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
is simply misguided.

311
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
An early example

312
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler

313
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
who was obsessed with understanding

314
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
a different number --

315
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,820
why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.

316
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,

317
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
but he never succeeded, and we know why.

318
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Kepler was asking

319
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
the wrong question.

320
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
We now know that there are many planets

321
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.

322
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
So hoping that the laws of physics

323
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,

324
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
well that is simply wrongheaded.

325
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Instead the right question to ask is,

326
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
why do we humans find ourselves on a planet

327
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
at this particular distance,

328
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
instead of any of the other possibilities?

329
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
And again, that's a question we can answer.

330
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun

331
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
would be so hot

332
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
that our form of life wouldn't exist.

333
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
And those planets that are much farther away from the star,

334
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
well they're so cold

335
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
that, again, our form of life would not take hold.

336
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
So we find ourselves

337
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
on a planet at this particular distance

338
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
simply because it yields conditions

339
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
vital to our form of life.

340
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
And when it comes to planets and their distances,

341
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.

342
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
The point is,

343
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,

344
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
it may also be the right kind of reasoning.

345
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
One key difference, of course,

346
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
is we know that there are other planets out there,

347
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
but so far I've only speculated on the possibility

348
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
that there might be other universes.

349
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
So to pull it all together,

350
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
we need a mechanism

351
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
that can actually generate other universes.

352
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
And that takes me to my final part, part three.

353
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Because such a mechanism has been found

354
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.

355
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,

356
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
we often have an image

357
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
of a kind of cosmic explosion

358
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
that created our universe

359
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
and set space rushing outward.

360
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
But there's a little secret.

361
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,

362
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
the Bang.

363
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,

364
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
but gives us no insight

365
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,820
into what would have powered the Bang itself.

366
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
And this gap was finally filled

367
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.

368
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
It's called inflationary cosmology,

369
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
which identified a particular kind of fuel

370
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
that would naturally generate

371
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
an outward rush of space.

372
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,

373
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
but the only detail that matters for us

374
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
is that this fuel proves to be so efficient

375
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
that it's virtually impossible

376
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
to use it all up,

377
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
which means in the inflationary theory,

378
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
the Big Bang giving rise to our universe

379
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
is likely not a one-time event.

380
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,

381
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,820
but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,

382
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
each giving rise to its own separate universe

383
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
with our universe becoming but one bubble

384
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.

385
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
And now, when we meld this with string theory,

386
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
here's the picture we're led to.

387
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.

388
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.

389
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
The different shapes yield different physical features.

390
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another

391
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
simply because it's only in our universe

392
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,

393
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
are right for our form of life to take hold.

394
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture

395
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
of the wider cosmos

396
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
that cutting-edge observation and theory

397
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,820
have now led us to seriously consider.

398
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
One big remaining question, of course, is,

399
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
could we ever confirm

400
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,820
the existence of other universes?

401
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Well let me describe

402
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
one way that might one day happen.

403
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
The inflationary theory

404
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
already has strong observational support.

405
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Because the theory predicts

406
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
that the Big Bang would have been so intense

407
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
that as space rapidly expanded,

408
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
tiny quantum jitters from the micro world

409
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,820
would have been stretched out to the macro world,

410
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
yielding a distinctive fingerprint,

411
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,

412
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
across space,

413
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
which powerful telescopes have now observed.

414
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Going further, if there are other universes,

415
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
the theory predicts that every so often

416
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
those universes can collide.

417
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
And if our universe got hit by another,

418
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
that collision

419
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
would generate an additional subtle pattern

420
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
of temperature variations across space

421
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
that we might one day

422
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
be able to detect.

423
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
And so exotic as this picture is,

424
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
it may one day be grounded

425
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
in observations,

426
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
establishing the existence of other universes.

427
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I'll conclude

428
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
with a striking implication

429
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
of all these ideas

430
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
for the very far future.

431
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
You see, we learned

432
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
that our universe is not static,

433
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
that space is expanding,

434
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
that that expansion is speeding up

435
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
and that there might be other universes

436
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
all by carefully examining

437
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
faint pinpoints of starlight

438
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,820
coming to us from distant galaxies.

439
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
But because the expansion is speeding up,

440
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
in the very far future,

441
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,820
those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast

442
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
that we won't be able to see them --

443
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
not because of technological limitations,

444
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
but because of the laws of physics.

445
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
The light those galaxies emit,

446
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,

447
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
will not be able to overcome

448
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
the ever-widening gulf between us.

449
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
So astronomers in the far future

450
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
looking out into deep space

451
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
will see nothing but an endless stretch

452
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,820
of static, inky, black stillness.

453
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
And they will conclude

454
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
that the universe is static and unchanging

455
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
and populated by a single central oasis of matter

456
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
that they inhabit --

457
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
a picture of the cosmos

458
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
that we definitively know to be wrong.

459
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records

460
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
handed down from an earlier era,

461
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
like ours,

462
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
attesting to an expanding cosmos

463
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
teeming with galaxies.

464
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
But would those future astronomers

465
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
believe such ancient knowledge?

466
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Or would they believe

467
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
in the black, static empty universe

468
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,820
that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?

469
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I suspect the latter.

470
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
Which means that we are living

471
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
through a remarkably privileged era

472
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
when certain deep truths about the cosmos

473
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
are still within reach

474
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
of the human spirit of exploration.

475
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,820
It appears that it may not always be that way.

476
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Because today's astronomers,

477
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,820
by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,

478
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,820
have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --

479
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
a kind of cosmic telegram

480
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
billions of years in transit.

481
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,820
and the message echoing across the ages is clear.

482
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Sometimes nature guards her secrets

483
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
with the unbreakable grip

484
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
of physical law.

485
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons

486
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,820
from just beyond the horizon.

487
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Thank you very much.

488
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,820
(Applause)

489
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.

490
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
The range of ideas you've just spoken about

491
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.

492
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
How do you think

493
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
of where cosmology is now,

494
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
in a sort of historical side?

495
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?

496
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
BG: Well it's hard to say.

497
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,820
When we learn that astronomers of the far future

498
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,820
may not have enough information to figure things out,

499
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,820
the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position

500
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
and certain deep, critical features of the universe

501
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,820
already have escaped our ability to understand

502
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
because of how cosmology evolves.

503
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
So from that perspective,

504
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
maybe we will always be asking questions

505
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
and never be able to fully answer them.

506
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
On the other hand, we now can understand

507
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
how old the universe is.

508
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
We can understand

509
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,820
how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation

510
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
that was set down 13.72 billion years ago --

511
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look

512
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
and it matches.

513
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Holy cow! That's just amazing.

514
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,820
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,

515
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,820
but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.

516
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.

517
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Maybe some of these conversations can continue.

518
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

519
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,820
(Applause)
