1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Do you know

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
deployed worldwide?

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
And these are base stations.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
And we also have

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
more than five billion

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
of these devices here.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
These are cellular mobile phones.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
And with these mobile phones,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
every month.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
a very large number.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
And wireless communications

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
has become a utility

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
like electricity and water.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now --

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
in our private lives, in our business lives.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
to switch off the mobile phone at events like this

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
for good reasons.

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
And it's this importance

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
why I decided to look into the issues

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
that this technology has,

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
because it's so fundamental to our lives.

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And one of the issues is capacity.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves --

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
in particular, radio waves.

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
And radio waves are limited.

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
They are scarce; they are expensive;

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
and we only have a certain range of it.

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
And it's this limitation

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
that doesn't cope

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
with the demand of wireless data transmissions

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
And we are simply running out of spectrum.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
There's another problem.

38
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
That is efficiency.

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
consume a lot of energy.

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
And mind you, most of the energy

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
is not used to transmit the radio waves,

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
it is used to cool the base stations.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Then the efficiency of such a base station

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
is only at about five percent.

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And that creates a big problem.

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
You have to switch off your mobile phone

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
during flights.

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
In hospitals, they are security issues.

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And security is another issue.

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
These radio waves penetrate through walls.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
They can be intercepted,

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
and somebody can make use of your network

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
if he has bad intentions.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
So these are the main four issues.

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
But on the other hand,

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
we have 14 billion of these:

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
light bulbs, light.

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
So let's look at this in the context

62
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.

63
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.

65
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Then there's ultraviolet light.

66
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
it's good for a nice suntan,

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
but otherwise dangerous for the human body.

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
Infrared --

69
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
due to eye safety regulations,

70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
can be only used with low power.

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.

72
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
It's light,

74
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
and light has been around for many millions of years.

75
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
And in fact, it has created us,

76
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
has created life,

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
has created all the stuff of life.

78
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
So it's inherently safe to use.

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,820
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
I compared the radio waves spectrum --

82
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
the size of it --

83
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
with the size of the visible light spectrum.

84
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
And guess what?

85
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,

86
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
which is there for us to use.

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.

89
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
We have 1.4 million

90
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
expensively deployed,

91
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
inefficient radio cellular base stations.

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And multiply that by 10,000,

93
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
then you end up at 14 billion.

94
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.

95
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
So we have the infrastructure there.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.

97
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.

98
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Can we use them for communications?

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Yes.

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
What do we need to do?

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
The one thing we need to do

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
florescent lights,

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
with this new technology of LED,

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
LED light bulbs.

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.

107
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
And it has a very nice acute property.

108
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Its intensity can be modulated

109
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
at very high speeds,

110
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
and it can be switched off at very high speeds.

111
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
And this is a fundamental basic property

112
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
that we exploit

113
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
with our technology.

114
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
So let's show how we do that.

115
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum --

116
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
go to remote controls.

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED --

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.

119
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream

120
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
in 10,000 bits per second,

121
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
20,000 bits per second.

122
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Not usable for a YouTube video.

123
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
What we have done

124
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
is we have developed a technology

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
with which we can furthermore

126
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
replace the remote control of our light bulb.

127
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
We transmit with our technology,

128
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
not only a single data stream,

129
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
we transmit thousands of data streams

130
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
in parallel,

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
at even higher speeds.

132
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
And the technology we have developed --

133
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
it's called SIM OFDM.

134
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
And it's spacial modulation --

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details --

136
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
but this is how we enabled

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
that light source

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
to transmit data.

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
You will say, "Okay, this is nice --

140
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
a slide created in 10 minutes."

141
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
But not only that.

142
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
What we've done

143
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
is we have also developed a demonstrator.

144
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And I'm showing for the first time in public

145
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
this visible light demonstrator.

146
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
And what we have here

147
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
is no ordinary desk lamp.

148
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
We fit in an LED light bulb,

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
worth three U.S. dollars,

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
put in our signal processing technology.

151
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
And then what we have here is a little hole.

152
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
And the light goes through that hole.

153
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
There's a receiver.

154
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude

155
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
that we create there

156
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
into an electrical signal.

157
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
And that signal is then converted back

158
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
to a high-speed data stream.

159
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
In the future we hope

160
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
that we can integrate this little hole

161
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
into these smart phones.

162
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
And not only integrate a photo detector here,

163
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
but maybe use the camera inside.

164
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
So what happens

165
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
when I switch on that light?

166
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
As you would expect,

167
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
it's a light, a desk lamp.

168
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Put your book beneath it and you can read.

169
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
It's illuminating the space.

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,820
But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.

171
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And that's a video, a high-definition video

172
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
that is transmitted through that light beam.

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
You're critical.

174
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
You think, "Ha, ha, ha.

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."

176
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
But let me do this.

177
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,820
(Applause)

178
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Once again.

179
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Still don't believe?

180
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
It is this light

181
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.

182
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
And if you look at the light,

183
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
it is illuminating as you would expect.

184
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
You don't notice with your human eye.

185
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude

186
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
that we impress onto this light bulb.

187
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
It's serving the purpose of illumination,

188
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.

189
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
And you see,

190
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.

191
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
It can ignore that constant light,

192
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
because all the receiver's interested in

193
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
are subtle changes.

194
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
You also have a critical question now, and

195
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
you say, "Okay,

196
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
do I have to have the light on all the time

197
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
to have this working?"

198
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
And the answer is yes.

199
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
But, you can dim down the light

200
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
to a level that it appears to be off.

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible.

202
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Capacity:

204
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
We have 10,000 times more spectrum,

205
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
10,000 times more LEDs

206
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
installed already in the infrastructure there.

207
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
You would agree with me, hopefully,

208
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
there's no issue of capacity anymore.

209
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Efficiency:

210
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
This is data through illumination --

211
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
it's first of all an illumination device.

212
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And if you do the energy budget,

213
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
the data transmission comes for free --

214
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
highly energy efficient.

215
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I don't mention the high energy efficiency

216
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
of these LED light bulbs.

217
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
If the whole world would deploy them,

218
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
you would save hundreds of power plants.

219
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
That's aside.

220
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
And then I've mentioned the availability.

221
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.

222
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
You need to see what to do.

223
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
You have lights in an aircraft.

224
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
So it's everywhere in a day there is light.

225
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.

226
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.

227
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.

228
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
And then there's security.

229
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
You would agree with me

230
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
that light doesn't penetrate through walls.

231
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
So no one, if I have a light here,

232
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
if I have secure data,

233
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
no one on the other side of this room through that wall

234
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
would be able to read that data.

235
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
And there's only data where there is light.

236
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820
So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,

237
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
then what I could do,

238
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
turn it away.

239
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.

240
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to.

241
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
So for me,

242
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
the applications of it,

243
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,820
to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.

244
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.

245
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
And you only have to notice, where we have light,

246
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
there is a potential way to transmit data.

247
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
But I can give you a few examples.

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Well you may see the impact already now.

249
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
This is a remote operated vehicle

250
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
beneath the ocean.

251
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
And they use light to illuminate space down there.

252
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data

253
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
that these things [use] to communicate with each other.

254
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Intrinsically safe environments

255
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
like this petrochemical plant --

256
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,

257
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.

258
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
In hospitals,

259
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
for new medical instruments;

260
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
in streets for traffic control.

261
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,

262
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
and cars can communicate with each other

263
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
and prevent accidents

264
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
in the way that they exchange information.

265
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.

266
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
And then you have these millions of street lamps

267
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
deployed around the world.

268
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
And every street lamp could be a free access point.

269
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,

270
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
light-fidelity.

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,820
And then we have these aircraft cabins.

272
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,820
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
and each of these lights

274
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.

275
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video

276
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
on your long flight back home.

277
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.

278
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
So, all we would need to do

279
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
is to fit a small microchip

280
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
to every potential illumination device.

281
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
And this would then combine

282
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
two basic functionalities:

283
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
illumination and wireless data transmission.

284
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe

285
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
could solve the four essential problems

286
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
that face us in wireless communication these days.

287
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
And in the future,

288
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,

289
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
you may have 14 billion Li-Fis

290
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
deployed worldwide --

291
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
for a cleaner, a greener,

292
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
and even a brighter future.

293
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Thank you.

294
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:41,820
(Applause)
