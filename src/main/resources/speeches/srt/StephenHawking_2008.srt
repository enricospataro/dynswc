1
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:16,736
There is nothing bigger
or older than the universe.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,248
The questions
I would like to talk about are:

3
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:28,558
one, where did we come from?

4
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:32,073
How did the universe come into being?

5
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,796
Are we alone in the universe?

6
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,964
Is there alien life out there?

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,433
What is the future of the human race?

8
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,796
Up until the 1920s,

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,796
everyone thought the universe
was essentially static

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,796
and unchanging in time.

11
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:55,475
Then it was discovered
that the universe was expanding.

12
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,649
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.

13
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:05,073
This meant they must have been
closer together in the past.

14
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:08,176
If we extrapolate back,

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,796
we find we must have
all been on top of each other

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,342
about 15 billion years ago.

17
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:19,207
This was the Big Bang,
the beginning of the universe.

18
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,232
But was there anything
before the Big Bang?

19
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:27,120
If not, what created the universe?

20
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:32,534
Why did the universe emerge
from the Big Bang the way it did?

21
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,796
We used to think
that the theory of the universe

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,280
could be divided into two parts.

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,796
First, there were the laws

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,484
like Maxwell's equations
and general relativity

25
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:48,473
that determined the evolution
of the universe,

26
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:51,795
given its state
over all of space at one time.

27
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:57,796
And second, there was no question
of the initial state of the universe.

28
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:02,796
We have made good progress
on the first part,

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,796
and now have the knowledge
of the laws of evolution

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,796
in all but the most extreme conditions.

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,796
But until recently,
we have had little idea

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,946
about the initial conditions
for the universe.

33
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:21,486
However, this division into laws
of evolution and initial conditions

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,431
depends on time and space
being separate and distinct.

35
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:31,295
Under extreme conditions,
general relativity and quantum theory

36
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,820
allow time to behave
like another dimension of space.

37
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:43,019
This removes the distinction
between time and space,

38
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:48,166
and means the laws of evolution
can also determine the initial state.

39
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,166
The universe can spontaneously
create itself out of nothing.

40
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:02,796
Moreover, we can calculate
a probability that the universe

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,220
was created in different states.

42
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,582
These predictions
are in excellent agreement

43
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:14,778
with observations by the WMAP satellite
of the cosmic microwave background,

44
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,796
which is an imprint
of the very early universe.

45
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,820
We think we have solved
the mystery of creation.

46
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,588
Maybe we should patent the universe

47
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:30,064
and charge everyone royalties
for their existence.

48
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:36,174
I now turn to the second big question:

49
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,820
are we alone, or is there
other life in the universe?

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,485
We believe that life arose
spontaneously on the Earth,

51
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:52,359
so it must be possible for life
to appear on other suitable planets,

52
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:55,977
of which there seem to be
a large number in the galaxy.

53
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:01,345
But we don't know how life first appeared.

54
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,796
We have two pieces
of observational evidence

55
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
on the probability of life appearing.

56
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:17,820
The first is that we have fossils of algae
from 3.5 billion years ago.

57
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,976
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,488
and was probably too hot
for about the first half billion years.

59
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,075
So life appeared on Earth

60
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:38,751
within half a billion years
of it being possible,

61
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:42,451
which is short compared
to the 10-billion-year lifetime

62
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,093
of a planet of Earth type.

63
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,935
This suggests that the probability
of life appearing is reasonably high.

64
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:54,314
If it was very low,
one would have expected it

65
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:57,796
to take most
of the ten billion years available.

66
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,550
On the other hand, we don't seem
to have been visited by aliens.

67
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:07,391
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.

68
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,694
Why would they appear
only to cranks and weirdos?

69
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,362
If there is a government conspiracy
to suppress the reports

70
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:22,796
and keep for itself the scientific
knowledge the aliens bring,

71
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,216
it seems to have been a singularly
ineffective policy so far.

72
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:36,796
Furthermore, despite an extensive search
by the SETI project,

73
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,796
we haven't heard any alien
television quiz shows.

74
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:46,241
This probably indicates
that there are no alien civilizations

75
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,511
at our stage of development

76
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:51,820
within a radius
of a few hundred light years.

77
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,796
Issuing an insurance policy

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,493
against abduction by aliens
seems a pretty safe bet.

79
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,215
This brings me to the last
of the big questions:

80
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,365
the future of the human race.

81
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,140
If we are the only intelligent
beings in the galaxy,

82
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,449
we should make sure
we survive and continue.

83
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,040
But we are entering an increasingly
dangerous period of our history.

84
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:32,618
Our population and our use
of the finite resources of planet Earth

85
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,714
are growing exponentially,

86
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:39,737
along with our technical ability
to change the environment for good or ill.

87
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,275
But our genetic code

88
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,306
still carries the selfish
and aggressive instincts

89
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,410
that were of survival
advantage in the past.

90
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,772
It will be difficult enough
to avoid disaster

91
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,512
in the next hundred years,

92
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:04,059
let alone the next thousand or million.

93
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,438
Our only chance of long-term survival

94
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,796
is not to remain inward-looking
on planet Earth,

95
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,048
but to spread out into space.

96
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,240
The answers to these big questions

97
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:27,036
show that we have made remarkable progress
in the last hundred years.

98
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:32,139
But if we want to continue
beyond the next hundred years,

99
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,326
our future is in space.

100
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,796
That is why I am in favor of manned --

101
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,533
or should I say, personed -- space flight.

102
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:51,796
All of my life I have sought
to understand the universe

103
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,309
and find answers to these questions.

104
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,158
I have been very lucky

105
00:07:57,182 --> 00:08:01,239
that my disability has not been
a serious handicap.

106
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:05,902
Indeed, it has probably given me
more time than most people

107
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,196
to pursue the quest for knowledge.

108
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:15,796
The ultimate goal is a complete
theory of the universe,

109
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,074
and we are making good progress.

110
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,740
Thank you for listening.

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,634
Chris Anderson: Professor,
if you had to guess either way,

112
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:33,464
do you now believe
that it is more likely than not

113
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:36,806
that we are alone in the Milky Way,

114
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,533
as a civilization of our level
of intelligence or higher?

115
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,796
This answer took seven minutes,
and really gave me an insight

116
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,872
into the incredible act of generosity
this whole talk was for TED.

117
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:22,796
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely
that we are the only civilization

118
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,155
within several hundred light years;

119
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,592
otherwise we would have heard radio waves.

120
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:36,772
The alternative is that civilizations
don't last very long,

121
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:38,957
but destroy themselves.

122
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,796
CA: Professor Hawking,
thank you for that answer.

123
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,769
We will take it
as a salutary warning, I think,

124
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:49,083
for the rest of our conference this week.

125
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:54,087
Professor, we really thank you
for the extraordinary effort you made

126
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:57,024
to share your questions with us today.

127
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:58,700
Thank you very much indeed.

128
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,536
(Applause)
