1
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:25,887
So what does it mean
for a machine to be athletic?

2
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,704
We will demonstrate the concept
of machine athleticism

3
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,424
and the research to achieve it

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,306
with the help of these flying machines
called quadrocopters,

5
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,377
or quads, for short.

6
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:40,004
Quads have been around for a long time.

7
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,598
They're so popular these days
because they're mechanically simple.

8
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,464
By controlling
the speeds of these four propellers,

9
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:49,233
these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,

10
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,428
and accelerate
along their common orientation.

11
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:55,197
On board are also a battery, a computer,

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,174
various sensors and wireless radios.

13
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,427
Quads are extremely agile,
but this agility comes at a cost.

14
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,670
They are inherently unstable,

15
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:08,265
and they need some form
of automatic feedback control

16
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,662
in order to be able to fly.

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,332
So, how did it just do that?

18
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,111
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop

19
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,565
serve as an indoor
global positioning system.

20
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,160
It's used to locate objects in the space

21
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:28,272
that have these reflective
markers on them.

22
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,334
This data is then sent to another laptop

23
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,716
that is running estimation
and control algorithms,

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,694
which in turn sends commands to the quad,

25
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,351
which is also running estimation
and control algorithms.

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,926
The bulk of our research is algorithms.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,526
It's the magic that brings
these machines to life.

28
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:52,144
So how does one design the algorithms
that create a machine athlete?

29
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,199
We use something broadly
called model-based design.

30
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,025
We first capture the physics

31
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,032
with a mathematical model
of how the machines behave.

32
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:04,406
We then use a branch of mathematics
called control theory

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,087
to analyze these models

34
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,881
and also to synthesize
algorithms for controlling them.

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,664
For example, that's how we can
make the quad hover.

36
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:15,978
We first captured the dynamics
with a set of differential equations.

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,454
We then manipulate these equations
with the help of control theory

38
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:22,415
to create algorithms
that stabilize the quad.

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,243
Let me demonstrate
the strength of this approach.

40
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,651
Suppose that we want
this quad to not only hover

41
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:33,334
but to also balance this pole.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,114
With a little bit of practice,

43
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:38,821
it's pretty straightforward
for a human being to do this,

44
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,036
although we do have the advantage
of having two feet on the ground

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,119
and the use of our very versatile hands.

46
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,362
It becomes a little bit more difficult

47
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,365
when I only have one foot on the ground

48
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,991
and when I don't use my hands.

49
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:55,115
Notice how this pole has
a reflective marker on top,

50
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,800
which means that it can
be located in the space.

51
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,163
(Audience) Oh!

52
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,446
(Applause)

53
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,183
(Applause ends)

54
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,848
You can notice that this quad
is making fine adjustments

55
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,246
to keep the pole balanced.

56
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,309
How did we design
the algorithms to do this?

57
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,928
We added the mathematical
model of the pole

58
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,399
to that of the quad.

59
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:25,401
Once we have a model
of the combined quad-pole system,

60
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,744
we can use control theory to create
algorithms for controlling it.

61
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:31,922
Here, you see that it's stable,

62
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,615
and even if I give it little nudges,

63
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,805
it goes back --

64
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:39,178
to the nice, balanced position.

65
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,297
We can also augment the model

66
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,692
to include where we want
the quad to be in space.

67
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,191
Using this pointer,
made out of reflective markers,

68
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,644
I can point to where I want
the quad to be in space

69
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:51,265
a fixed distance away from me.

70
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,485
(Laughter)

71
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,709
The key to these acrobatic
maneuvers is algorithms,

72
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,026
designed with the help
of mathematical models

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,235
and control theory.

74
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,051
Let's tell the quad to come back here

75
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,739
and let the pole drop,

76
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,894
and I will next demonstrate the importance

77
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,907
of understanding physical models

78
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,976
and the workings of the physical world.

79
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:41,110
Notice how the quad lost altitude
when I put this glass of water on it.

80
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,537
Unlike the balancing pole,

81
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,576
I did not include the mathematical
model of the glass

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,907
in the system.

83
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,944
In fact, the system doesn't even know
that the glass is there.

84
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,706
Like before, I could use
the pointer to tell the quad

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,301
where I want it to be in space.

86
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,303
(Applause)

87
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,891
(Applause ends)

88
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,074
Okay, you should be asking yourself,

89
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,160
why doesn't the water
fall out of the glass?

90
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,738
Two facts.

91
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:14,395
The first is that gravity acts
on all objects in the same way.

92
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,650
The second is that the propellers

93
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,747
are all pointing in the same direction
of the glass, pointing up.

94
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:22,109
You put these two things together,

95
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,688
the net result is that all side forces
on the glass are small

96
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:27,989
and are mainly dominated
by aerodynamic effects,

97
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,974
which at these speeds are negligible.

98
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,490
And that's why you don't need
to model the glass.

99
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,255
It naturally doesn't spill,
no matter what the quad does.

100
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,883
(Audience) Oh!

101
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,018
(Applause)

102
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,234
(Applause ends)

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,874
The lesson here

104
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:02,911
is that some high-performance tasks
are easier than others,

105
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,272
and that understanding
the physics of the problem

106
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,990
tells you which ones are easy
and which ones are hard.

107
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:10,524
In this instance, carrying
a glass of water is easy.

108
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,178
Balancing a pole is hard.

109
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:18,262
We've all heard stories of athletes
performing feats while physically injured.

110
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:21,471
Can a machine also perform
with extreme physical damage?

111
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,941
Conventional wisdom says

112
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:27,848
that you need at least four fixed motor
propeller pairs in order to fly,

113
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,396
because there are four degrees
of freedom to control:

114
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,385
roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.

115
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:36,233
Hexacopters and octocopters,
with six and eight propellers,

116
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,716
can provide redundancy,

117
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,705
but quadrocopters are much more popular

118
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,415
because they have the minimum number
of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.

119
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,004
Or do they?

120
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:53,647
(Audience) Oh!

121
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,227
(Laughter)

122
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,872
If we analyze the mathematical
model of this machine

123
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:06,048
with only two working propellers,

124
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,812
we discover that there's
an unconventional way to fly it.

125
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,482
We relinquish control of yaw,

126
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,552
but roll, pitch and acceleration
can still be controlled

127
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,922
with algorithms that exploit
this new configuration.

128
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:37,777
Mathematical models tell us
exactly when and why this is possible.

129
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,579
In this instance, this knowledge
allows us to design

130
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:43,076
novel machine architectures

131
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,768
or to design clever algorithms
that gracefully handle damage,

132
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,492
just like human athletes do,

133
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,780
instead of building
machines with redundancy.

134
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,165
We can't help but hold our breath

135
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,864
when we watch a diver
somersaulting into the water,

136
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,841
or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,

137
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,372
the ground fast approaching.

138
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,940
Will the diver be able
to pull off a rip entry?

139
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:04,771
Will the vaulter stick the landing?

140
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:08,292
Suppose we want this quad here
to perform a triple flip

141
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:11,142
and finish off at the exact same
spot that it started.

142
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,675
This maneuver is going
to happen so quickly

143
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,544
that we can't use position feedback
to correct the motion during execution.

144
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:19,165
There simply isn't enough time.

145
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:23,272
Instead, what the quad can do
is perform the maneuver blindly,

146
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,504
observe how it finishes the maneuver,

147
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,005
and then use that information
to modify its behavior

148
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,667
so that the next flip is better.

149
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,029
Similar to the diver and the vaulter,

150
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,948
it is only through repeated practice

151
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,115
that the maneuver can
be learned and executed

152
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,381
to the highest standard.

153
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,189
(Laughter)

154
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:49,998
(Applause)

155
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:54,432
Striking a moving ball
is a necessary skill in many sports.

156
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,439
How do we make a machine do

157
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:59,051
what an athlete does
seemingly without effort?

158
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:10,874
(Laughter)

159
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,820
(Applause)

160
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,618
(Applause ends)

161
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,988
This quad has a racket
strapped onto its head

162
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:28,475
with a sweet spot roughly the size
of an apple, so not too large.

163
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:31,642
The following calculations
are made every 20 milliseconds,

164
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,983
or 50 times per second.

165
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,697
We first figure out where
the ball is going.

166
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,855
We then next calculate
how the quad should hit the ball

167
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,364
so that it flies
to where it was thrown from.

168
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,202
Third, a trajectory is planned
that carries the quad

169
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:49,226
from its current state
to the impact point with the ball.

170
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,829
Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds'
worth of that strategy.

171
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:55,979
Twenty milliseconds later,
the whole process is repeated

172
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,770
until the quad strikes the ball.

173
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,514
(Applause)

174
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,374
Machines can not only perform
dynamic maneuvers on their own,

175
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:15,237
they can do it collectively.

176
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:18,848
These three quads are cooperatively
carrying a sky net.

177
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,088
(Applause)

178
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,781
(Applause ends)

179
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:38,146
They perform an extremely dynamic
and collective maneuver

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,838
to launch the ball back to me.

181
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:43,008
Notice that, at full extension,
these quads are vertical.

182
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:50,054
(Applause)

183
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,221
In fact, when fully extended,

184
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,508
this is roughly five times greater
than what a bungee jumper feels

185
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,502
at the end of their launch.

186
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,482
The algorithms to do this are very similar

187
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:08,421
to what the single quad used
to hit the ball back to me.

188
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,730
Mathematical models are used
to continuously re-plan

189
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,585
a cooperative strategy
50 times per second.

190
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:20,585
Everything we have seen so far has been
about the machines and their capabilities.

191
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,601
What happens when we couple
this machine athleticism

192
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,108
with that of a human being?

193
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:29,181
What I have in front of me
is a commercial gesture sensor

194
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,490
mainly used in gaming.

195
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,562
It can recognize
what my various body parts

196
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,903
are doing in real time.

197
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,609
Similar to the pointer
that I used earlier,

198
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,855
we can use this as inputs to the system.

199
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:41,646
We now have a natural way of interacting

200
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,931
with the raw athleticism
of these quads with my gestures.

201
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:26,392
(Applause)

202
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,190
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.

203
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:39,404
It can be physical.

204
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,324
Take this quad, for example.

205
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:43,936
It's trying to stay
at a fixed point in space.

206
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:48,442
If I try to move it
out of the way, it fights me,

207
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,340
and moves back to where it wants to be.

208
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:54,161
We can change this behavior, however.

209
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,868
We can use mathematical models

210
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,556
to estimate the force
that I'm applying to the quad.

211
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:03,239
Once we know this force,
we can also change the laws of physics,

212
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,350
as far as the quad
is concerned, of course.

213
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:11,071
Here, the quad is behaving
as if it were in a viscous fluid.

214
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,109
We now have an intimate way
of interacting with a machine.

215
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,895
I will use this new capability to position

216
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,472
this camera-carrying quad
to the appropriate location

217
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,924
for filming the remainder
of this demonstration.

218
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,786
So we can physically interact
with these quads

219
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,770
and we can change the laws of physics.

220
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,190
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.

221
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,728
For what you will see next,

222
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:48,046
these quads will initially behave
as if they were on Pluto.

223
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,014
As time goes on, gravity will be increased

224
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,063
until we're all back on planet Earth,

225
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,853
but I assure you we won't get there.

226
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,306
Okay, here goes.

227
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,268
(Laughter)

228
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:37,558
(Laughter)

229
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:41,439
(Applause)

230
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,646
Whew!

231
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,092
You're all thinking now,

232
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:50,067
these guys are having way too much fun,

233
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,146
and you're probably also asking yourself,

234
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,971
why exactly are they building
machine athletes?

235
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,916
Some conjecture that the role
of play in the animal kingdom

236
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,077
is to hone skills
and develop capabilities.

237
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,725
Others think that it has
more of a social role,

238
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,399
that it's used to bind the group.

239
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:08,759
Similarly, we use the analogy
of sports and athleticism

240
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,838
to create new algorithms for machines

241
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,305
to push them to their limits.

242
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,218
What impact will the speed
of machines have on our way of life?

243
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:19,051
Like all our past creations
and innovations,

244
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:21,878
they may be used to improve
the human condition

245
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:23,876
or they may be misused and abused.

246
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,717
This is not a technical choice
we are faced with;

247
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,756
it's a social one.

248
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,503
Let's make the right choice,

249
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,439
the choice that brings out the best
in the future of machines,

250
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,328
just like athleticism in sports
can bring out the best in us.

251
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,275
Let me introduce you to the wizards
behind the green curtain.

252
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,633
They're the current members
of the Flying Machine Arena research team.

253
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:46,874
(Applause)

254
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:49,365
Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,

255
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,814
Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin,
Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.

256
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:55,362
Look out for them.
They're destined for great things.

257
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:56,440
Thank you.

258
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,920
(Applause)
