1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
When I was president of the American Psychological Association,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
they tried to media-train me,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
and an encounter I had with CNN

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,820
which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,820
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them,

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm going to give you the eleventh.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,820
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said, "Professor Seligman,

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
would you tell us about the state of psychology today?

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
We'd like to interview you about that." And I said, "Great."

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,820
And she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
So I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
And she said, "Well, one."

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
(Laughter)

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
And cameras rolled, and she said, "Professor Seligman,

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,820
what is the state of psychology today?"

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
"Good."

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
(Laughter)

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
"Cut. Cut. That won't do.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,820
We'd really better give you a longer sound bite."

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,820
"Well, how many words do I get this time?" "I think, well, you get two.

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
"Not good."

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:38,820
(Laughter)

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
"Look, Doctor Seligman,

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium.

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
We'd better give you a real sound bite.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
This time you can have three words.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,820
"Not good enough." And that's what I'm going to be talking about.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,820
I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,820
and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology,

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,820
about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.

35
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
So, why was psychology good?

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,820
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did,

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
they'd move away from me.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
And because, quite rightly, they were saying

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,820
And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
And what was good about psychology,

44
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,820
about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made,

45
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
about working in the disease model,

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
about what you mean by psychology,

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,820
is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable --

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
it was entirely smoke and mirrors.

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable,

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
two of them actually curable.

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed,

52
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
a science of mental illness.

53
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:21,820
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism --

54
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
and measure them with rigor.

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,820
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.

57
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
We could look across time at the same people --

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia --

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,820
and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are,

60
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
and we could isolate third variables

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years,

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,820
to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.

64
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And then we were able to test them rigorously,

65
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
in random assignment, placebo controlled designs,

66
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,820
throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.

67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years,

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,820
can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,820
And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it.

70
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,820
But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
The first was moral,

72
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,820
that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers,

73
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,820
that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,820
We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.

76
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,820
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.

77
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,820
We forgot about improving normal lives.

78
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,820
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,820
more fulfilled, more productive. And "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.

80
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
No one works on that.

81
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,820
And the third problem about the disease model is,

82
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
in our rush to do something about people in trouble,

83
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,820
in our rush to do something about repairing damage,

84
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
it never occurred to us to develop interventions

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,820
to make people happier, positive interventions.

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
So that was not good.

87
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,820
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,

88
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology,

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
which has three aims.

90
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,820
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
with human strength as it is with weakness.

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,820
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
It should be interested in the best things in life.

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,820
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling,

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,820
and with genius, with nurturing high talent.

96
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future,

97
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,820
we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology,

98
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
a science of what makes life worth living.

99
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,820
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,820
And any of you, for free, can go to that website

101
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.

102
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,820
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning,

103
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?

104
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,820
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities:

105
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,820
a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,

106
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
how they're defined, how to diagnose them,

107
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,820
what builds them and what gets in their way.

108
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,820
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states,

109
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,820
the relationship between left hemispheric activity

110
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,820
and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.

111
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people,

112
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
and I've asked the question,

113
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,820
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.

115
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
And how do they differ from the rest of us?

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
And it turns out there's one way.

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
They're not more religious, they're not in better shape,

118
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
they don't have more money, they're not better looking,

119
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
they don't have more good events and fewer bad events.

120
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,820
The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.

121
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.

122
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,820
(Laughter)

123
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
They don't spend time alone.

124
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Each of them is in a romantic relationship

125
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
and each has a rich repertoire of friends.

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,820
But watch out here. This is merely correlational data, not causal,

127
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,820
and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about:

128
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.

129
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,820
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment.

130
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,820
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries,

131
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.

132
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
About 120 interventions have been proposed

133
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
that allegedly make people happy.

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,820
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them,

135
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
and we actually carry out random assignment

136
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
efficacy and effectiveness studies.

137
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,820
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?

138
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.

139
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,820
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have,

140
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,820
in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill,

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable,

142
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,820
is can psychology actually make people happier?

143
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,820
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much --

144
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,820
we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.

145
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
And I believe there are three different --

146
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,820
and I call them different because different interventions build them,

147
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
it's possible to have one rather than the other --

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
three different happy lives.

149
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
The first happy life is the pleasant life.

150
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,820
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can,

151
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
and the skills to amplify it.

152
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
The second is a life of engagement --

153
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,820
a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.

154
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
That's what Aristotle was talking about.

155
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
And third, the meaningful life.

156
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives

157
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
and what we know about them.

158
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,820
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it,

159
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
it's having as many of the pleasures as you can,

160
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
as much positive emotion as you can,

161
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,820
and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them,

162
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
that stretch them over time and space.

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,

164
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,820
and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.

165
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life,

166
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,820
your experience of positive emotion, is heritable,

167
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,820
about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.

168
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,820
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know

169
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life

170
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,820
are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.

171
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed.

172
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent;

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.

174
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.

175
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
And this leads to the second life.

176
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
And I have to tell you about my friend, Len,

177
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,820
to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,

178
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
more than building pleasure.

179
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,

180
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work.

181
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.

182
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire

183
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
and the head of an options trading company.

184
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Second, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.

185
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,820
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.

186
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,820
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.

187
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
(Laughter)

188
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Len is an introvert.

189
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,820
American women said to Len, when he dated them,

190
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."

191
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,820
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma

193
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.

194
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.

195
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,820
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island

196
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,820
and he played football and watched football, and played bridge --

197
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.

198
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
The question is, is Len unhappy? And I want to say not.

199
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent

200
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
of the human race in positive affectivity,

201
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.

202
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness

203
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.

204
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,820
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning,

205
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell.

206
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
When the first card is played,

207
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.

208
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,820
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about,

209
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,820
about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.

210
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Pleasure has raw feels: you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling.

211
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:52,820
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.

212
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,820
You're one with the music. Time stops.

213
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
You have intense concentration.

214
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,820
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.

215
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
And we think there's a recipe for it,

216
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
and it's knowing what your highest strengths are.

217
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
And again, there's a valid test

218
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
of what your five highest strengths are.

219
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,820
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.

220
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Re-crafting your work, your love,

221
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
your play, your friendship, your parenting.

222
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.

223
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Hated the job.

224
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
She's working her way through college.

225
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Her highest strength was social intelligence,

226
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,820
so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her

227
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
the social highlight of every customer's day.

228
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Now obviously she failed.

229
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
But what she did was to take her highest strengths,

230
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,820
and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.

231
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.

232
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.

233
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,820
You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.

234
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,820
So, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion.

235
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
The second path is eudaimonian flow.

236
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
And the third path is meaning.

237
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,820
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.

238
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,820
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia --

239
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,820
it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them

240
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,820
to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.

241
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life,

242
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,820
the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question,

243
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,820
are there things that lastingly change those lives?

244
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,820
And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it.

245
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
It's being done in a rigorous manner.

246
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,820
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.

247
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,820
So we do random assignment, placebo controlled,

248
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
long-term studies of different interventions.

249
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,820
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect,

250
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,820
when we teach people about the pleasant life,

251
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
how to have more pleasure in your life,

252
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,820
one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills,

253
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,820
and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.

254
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day,

255
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.

256
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,820
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.

257
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would.

258
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Close your eyes.

259
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important

260
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
that changed your life in a good direction,

261
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
and who you never properly thanked.

262
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
The person has to be alive. OK.

263
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.

264
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
I hope all of you have such a person.

265
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit,

266
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person,

267
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
call them on the phone in Phoenix,

268
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,820
ask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door,

269
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,820
you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.

270
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,820
And what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later,

271
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,820
three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.

272
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Another example is a strength date, in which we get couples

273
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test,

274
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,820
and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths,

275
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.

276
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
And fun versus philanthropy.

277
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this,

278
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,820
in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.

279
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this,

280
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
so we actually have people do something altruistic

281
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
and do something fun, and to contrast it.

282
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
And what you find is when you do something fun,

283
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
it has a square wave walk set.

284
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,820
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.

285
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
So those are examples of positive interventions.

286
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,820
So, the next to last thing I want to say is

287
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.

288
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,820
And this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable.

289
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,820
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,

290
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
how much life satisfaction do you get?

291
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,820
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people --

292
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure,

293
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,820
the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life,

294
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you,

295
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,820
and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?

296
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.

297
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,820
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.

298
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.

299
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,820
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.

300
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement

301
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.

302
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.

303
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Conversely, if you have none of the three,

304
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.

305
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
And what we're asking now is

306
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,820
does the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity,

307
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,820
how long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?

308
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
That is, in a corporation,

309
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,820
is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?

310
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Is health a function of positive engagement,

311
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
of pleasure, and of meaning in life?

312
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,820
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.

313
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,820
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard,

314
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,820
and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this.

315
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much,

316
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
which was one of the remarkable things.

317
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,820
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel

318
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,820
to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.

319
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,820
We all know that technology, entertainment and design

320
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,820
have been and can be used for destructive purposes.

321
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,820
We also know that technology, entertainment and design

322
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,820
can be used to relieve misery.

323
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,820
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery

324
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
and building happiness is extremely important.

325
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,820
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago,

326
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,820
that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed,

327
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,820
not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.

328
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,820
And I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero.

329
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
But they were empty.

330
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,820
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life,

331
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,820
the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning,

332
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,820
are different from the skills of relieving misery.

333
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,820
And so, the parallel thing holds

334
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.

335
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:07,820
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world

336
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,820
to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion,

337
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
and that's typically how they've been used.

338
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do --

339
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,820
not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough --

340
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,820
there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.

341
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
As Laura Lee told us,

342
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,820
design, and, I believe, entertainment and technology,

343
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,820
can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.

344
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,820
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism,

345
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,820
in addition to the space elevator,

346
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,820
is that I think with technology, entertainment and design,

347
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,820
we can actually increase the amount of tonnage

348
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
of human happiness on the planet.

349
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,820
And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life,

350
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,820
the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.

351
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,820
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion,

352
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,820
meaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.

353
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,820
And if design can increase positive emotion,

354
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,820
eudaimonia, and flow and meaning,

355
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,820
what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you.

356
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:35,820
(Applause)
