1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,042
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

2
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,796
I've been making games
online now for 10 years,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,796
and my goal for the next decade

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,216
is to try to make it as easy
to save the world in real life

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,796
as it is to save the world
in online games.

6
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,437
Now, I have a plan for this,

7
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:33,374
and it entails convincing more people,

8
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:38,255
including all of you, to spend more time
playing bigger and better games.

9
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:42,796
Right now we spend three billion hours
a week playing online games.

10
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,796
Some of you might be thinking,

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,963
"That's a lot of time
to spend playing games.

12
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:48,289
Maybe too much time,

13
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:51,796
considering how many urgent problems
we have to solve in the real world."

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,796
But actually, according to my research
at the Institute for the Future,

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,796
actually the opposite is true.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,145
Three billion hours a week
is not nearly enough game play

17
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:04,567
to solve the world's most urgent problems.

18
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,210
In fact, I believe
that if we want to survive

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,796
the next century on this planet,

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,343
we need to increase
that total dramatically.

21
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,345
I've calculated the total we need

22
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,407
at 21 billion hours
of game play every week.

23
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,009
So, that's probably a bit
of a counter-intuitive idea,

24
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,574
so I'll say it again, let it sink in:

25
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,796
If we want to solve problems like hunger,

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,066
poverty, climate change,
global conflict, obesity,

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,106
I believe that we need to aspire
to play games online

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,702
for at least 21 billion hours a week,
by the end of the next decade.

29
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:36,734
(Laughter)

30
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:38,876
No. I'm serious. I am.

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,051
Here's why.

32
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:43,318
This picture pretty much sums up
why I think games are so essential

33
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,481
to the future survival
of the human species.

34
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,509
(Laughter)

35
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,684
Truly.

36
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,325
This is a portrait
by photographer Phil Toledano.

37
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,589
He wanted to capture
the emotion of gaming,

38
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,723
so he set up a camera in front
of gamers while they were playing.

39
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:58,672
And this is a classic gaming emotion.

40
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,601
Now, if you're not a gamer,

41
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,022
you might miss some
of the nuance in this photo.

42
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,796
You probably see the sense of urgency,

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,204
a little bit of fear,
but intense concentration,

44
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,796
deep, deep focus on tackling
a really difficult problem.

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,557
If you are a gamer, you will notice
a few nuances here:

46
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,370
the crinkle of the eyes up,
and around the mouth

47
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:20,989
is a sign of optimism,

48
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,448
and the eyebrows up is surprise.

49
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:27,599
This is a gamer who's on the verge
of something called an "epic win."

50
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:28,796
(Laughter)

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,226
Oh, you've heard of that.

52
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,782
OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.

53
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:37,052
An epic win is an outcome
that is so extraordinarily positive,

54
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:40,092
you had no idea it was even
possible until you achieved it.

55
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:44,375
It was almost beyond the threshold
of imagination, and when you get there,

56
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,058
you're shocked to discover
what you're truly capable of.

57
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,240
That's an epic win.

58
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,648
This is a gamer on the verge
of an epic win.

59
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,085
And this is the face that we need to see

60
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:55,796
on millions of problem-solvers
all over the world

61
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,141
as we try to tackle the obstacles
of the next century --

62
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,796
the face of someone who, against all odds,

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,717
is on the verge of an epic win.

64
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:07,057
Now, unfortunately this is more
of the face that we see

65
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,852
in everyday life now as we try
to tackle urgent problems.

66
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:12,375
This is what I call
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

67
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,899
This is actually me making it.

68
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,176
Can you see? Yes. Good.

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,796
This is me making
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

70
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,201
This is a piece of graffiti
in my old neighborhood

71
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,480
in Berkeley, California,
where I did my PhD

72
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:25,718
on why we're better in games
than we are in real life.

73
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,021
And this is a problem
that a lot of gamers have.

74
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:32,322
We feel that we are not as good
in reality as we are in games.

75
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,796
I don't mean just good as in successful,
although that's part of it.

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,665
We do achieve more in game worlds.

77
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:41,655
But I also mean good as in motivated
to do something that matters --

78
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,463
inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.

79
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:45,939
And when we're in game worlds,

80
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:49,020
I believe that many of us become
the best version of ourselves --

81
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,162
the most likely to help
at a moment's notice,

82
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,027
the most likely to stick
with a problem as long at it takes,

83
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,137
to get up after failure and try again.

84
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:59,796
And in real life, when we face failure,

85
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,710
when we confront obstacles,
we often don't feel that way.

86
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,576
We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,340
we feel anxious, maybe depressed,
frustrated or cynical.

88
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,920
We never have those feelings
when we're playing games,

89
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,483
they just don't exist in games.

90
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:16,564
So that's what I wanted to study
when I was a graduate student.

91
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,060
What about games makes it impossible

92
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,537
to feel that we can't achieve everything?

93
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,965
How can we take those feelings from games

94
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,652
and apply them to real-world work?

95
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,074
So I looked at games
like World of Warcraft,

96
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,383
which is really the ideal collaborative
problem-solving environment.

97
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,231
And I started to notice a few things

98
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:36,412
that make epic wins
so possible in online worlds.

99
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:39,721
The first thing is whenever you show up
in one of these online games,

100
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,324
especially in World of Warcraft,

101
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,642
there are lots and lots
of different characters

102
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,920
who are willing to trust you
with a world-saving mission, right away.

103
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:49,445
But not just any mission,

104
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,285
it's a mission that is perfectly matched
with your current level in the game.

105
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,015
Right? So you can do it.

106
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,484
They never give you a challenge
you can't achieve.

107
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,883
But it is on the verge
of what you're capable of,

108
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,151
so you have to try hard.

109
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,496
But there's no unemployment
in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,671
wringing your hands --

111
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:08,514
there's always something
specific and important to be done.

112
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:10,371
There are also tons of collaborators.

113
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,783
Everywhere you go,
hundreds of thousands of people

114
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,749
ready to work with you
to achieve your epic mission.

115
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,399
That's not something we have
in real life that easily,

116
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:21,412
this sense that at our fingertips
are tons of collaborators.

117
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,927
And there's this epic story,
this inspiring story of why we're there,

118
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,112
and what we're doing,

119
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,014
and we get all this positive feedback.

120
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,031
You guys have heard of leveling up,
+1 strength, +1 intelligence.

121
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:34,737
We don't get that kind
of constant feedback in real life.

122
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,002
When I get off this stage,

123
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:40,908
I'm not going to have
+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,

124
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:42,596
+20 crazy idea.

125
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,638
I don't get that feedback in real life.

126
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:49,510
Now, the problem with collaborative
online environments like World of Warcraft

127
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:53,689
is that it's so satisfying to be
on the verge of an epic win all the time,

128
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,288
we decide to spend all our time
in these game worlds.

129
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,796
It's just better than reality.

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,796
So, so far, collectively
all the World of Warcraft gamers

131
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,796
have spent 5.93 million years

132
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,796
solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,980
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

134
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,196
It might sound like it's a bad thing.

135
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,544
But to put that in context:

136
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:15,651
5.93 million years ago

137
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:20,300
was when our earliest primate
human ancestors stood up.

138
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:23,054
That was the first upright primate.

139
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:26,182
So when we talk about how much time

140
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,218
we're currently investing
in playing games,

141
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:31,020
the only way it makes sense
to even think about it

142
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:34,796
is to talk about time
at the magnitude of human evolution,

143
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,796
which is an extraordinary thing.

144
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,328
But it's also apt,

145
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,510
because it turns out that by spending
all this time playing games,

146
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,796
we're actually changing
what we are capable of as human beings.

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,134
We're evolving to be a more
collaborative and hearty species.

148
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,928
This is true. I believe this.

149
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,110
So, consider this really
interesting statistic;

150
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:56,618
it was recently published by a researcher
at Carnegie Mellon University:

151
00:06:56,642 --> 00:07:00,796
The average young person today
in a country with a strong gamer culture

152
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,474
will have spent 10,000 hours
playing online games

153
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:05,744
by the age of 21.

154
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,565
Now 10,000 hours is a really
interesting number for two reasons.

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,686
First of all, for children
in the United States,

156
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,694
10,080 hours is the exact amount
of time you will spend in school,

157
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,820
from fifth grade
to high school graduation,

158
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,367
if you have perfect attendance.

159
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,392
(Laughter)

160
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,001
So, we have an entire
parallel track of education going on,

161
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,733
where young people are learning as much
about what it takes to be a good gamer

162
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,237
as they're learning
about everything else in school.

163
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,848
Some of you have probably read
Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"

164
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,214
so you would have heard
of his theory of success,

165
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,337
the "10,000 hours" theory of success.

166
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,796
It's based on this great
cognitive-science research

167
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,137
that says if we can master 10,000 hours

168
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:50,534
of effortful study at anything
by the age of 21,

169
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,057
we will be virtuosos at it.

170
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:53,796
We will be as good at whatever we do

171
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,661
as the greatest people in the world.

172
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,443
And so, now what we're looking at

173
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:02,348
is an entire generation of young people
who are virtuoso gamers.

174
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:05,796
So, the big question is,

175
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,137
"What exactly are gamers
getting so good at?"

176
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,946
Because if we could figure that out,

177
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,375
we would have a virtually unprecedented
human resource on our hands.

178
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,662
This is how many people
we now have in the world

179
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:20,573
who spend at least an hour
a day playing online games.

180
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,693
These are our virtuoso gamers,

181
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:26,549
500 million people who are
extraordinarily good at something.

182
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:28,796
And in the next decade,

183
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
we're going to have another billion gamers

184
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,621
who are extraordinarily
good at whatever that is.

185
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,796
If you don't know it already,
this is coming.

186
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,796
The game industry is developing consoles

187
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,174
that are low-energy and that work
with the wireless phone networks

188
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,024
instead of broadband Internet,

189
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,796
so that gamers all over the world,

190
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,644
particularly in India, China,
Brazil, can get online.

191
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:51,294
They expect one billion more
gamers in the next decade.

192
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,342
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.

193
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,245
So I've started to think about

194
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,485
what these games
are making us virtuosos at.

195
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,460
Here are the four things I came up with.

196
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,444
The first is urgent optimism.

197
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:04,150
OK, think of this
as extreme self-motivation.

198
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:07,611
Urgent optimism is the desire
to act immediately

199
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,292
to tackle an obstacle,

200
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:12,896
combined with the belief that we have
a reasonable hope of success.

201
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,249
Gamers always believe
that an epic win is possible,

202
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:18,978
and that it's always worth
trying, and trying now.

203
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,252
Gamers don't sit around.

204
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,649
Gamers are virtuosos
at weaving a tight social fabric.

205
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,930
There's a lot of interesting
research that shows

206
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,510
we like people better
after we play a game with them,

207
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,343
even if they've beaten us badly.

208
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,709
And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust
to play a game with someone.

209
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,025
We trust that they will spend
their time with us,

210
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,891
that they will play by the same rules,

211
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,247
value the same goal,
stay with the game until it's over.

212
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,839
And so, playing a game together

213
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,796
actually builds up bonds
and trust and cooperation.

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,645
And we actually build stronger
social relationships as a result.

215
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,796
Blissful productivity. I love it.

216
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,114
You know, there's a reason why
the average World of Warcraft gamer

217
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,796
plays for 22 hours a week --
kind of a half-time job.

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,422
It's because we know,
when we're playing a game,

219
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:03,795
that we're actually happier working hard

220
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,070
than we are relaxing, or hanging out.

221
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:08,372
We know that we are
optimized as human beings,

222
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:10,014
to do hard and meaningful work.

223
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:13,245
And gamers are willing
to work hard all the time,

224
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,870
if they're given the right work.

225
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,086
Finally: epic meaning.

226
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:21,331
Gamers love to be attached
to awe-inspiring missions

227
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,367
to human planetary-scale stories.

228
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,131
So, just one bit of trivia
that helps put that into perspective:

229
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:32,796
So, you all know Wikipedia,
biggest wiki in the world.

230
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:36,796
Second biggest wiki in the world,
with nearly 80,000 articles,

231
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,796
is the World of Warcraft wiki.

232
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,796
Five million people use it every month.

233
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,479
They have compiled more information
about World of Warcraft on the Internet

234
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:47,610
than any other topic covered
on any other wiki in the world.

235
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:49,670
They are building an epic story.

236
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:51,916
They are building an epic
knowledge resource

237
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,472
about the World of Warcraft.

238
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:57,796
Okay, so these are four superpowers
that add up to one thing:

239
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,306
Gamers are super-empowered
hopeful individuals.

240
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:05,820
These are people who believe
that they are individually capable

241
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:07,394
of changing the world.

242
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,053
And the only problem is,

243
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:12,106
they believe that they are capable
of changing virtual worlds

244
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,796
and not the real world.

245
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,933
That's the problem
that I'm trying to solve.

246
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,796
There's an economist
named Edward Castronova.

247
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,990
His work is brilliant.

248
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,916
He looks at why people are investing
so much time and energy

249
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,796
and money in online worlds.

250
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,003
And he says,

251
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:29,335
"We're witnessing what amounts to
no less than a mass exodus

252
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,796
to virtual worlds and online
game environments."

253
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,009
And he's an economist, so he's rational.

254
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,470
And he says --

255
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,137
(Laughter)

256
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,446
Not like me, I'm a game
designer; I'm exuberant.

257
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,669
But he says that this makes perfect sense,

258
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:46,117
because gamers can achieve
more in online worlds

259
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,467
than they can in real life.

260
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,952
They can have stronger
social relationships in games

261
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,531
than they can have in real life;

262
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,522
they get better feedback
and feel more rewarded in games

263
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:55,796
than they do in real life.

264
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense

265
00:11:57,844 --> 00:12:01,419
for gamers to spend more time
in virtual worlds than the real world.

266
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:04,796
Now, I also agree
that that is rational, for now.

267
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,796
But it is not, by any means,
an optimal situation.

268
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,796
We have to start making
the real world work more like a game.

269
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,179
I take my inspiration
from something that happened

270
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:15,632
2,500 years ago.

271
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:19,796
These are ancient dice,
made out of sheep's knuckles.

272
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,796
Before we had awesome game controllers,

273
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,633
we had sheep's knuckles.

274
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,725
And these represent
the first game equipment

275
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,615
designed by human beings,

276
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,383
and if you're familiar with the work
of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

277
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:33,916
you might know this history,

278
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,860
which is the history
of who invented games and why.

279
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,380
Herodotus says that games,
particularly dice games,

280
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:42,796
were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,

281
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,629
during a time of famine.

282
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,992
Apparently, there was such a severe famine

283
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,796
that the king of Lydia decided
they had to do something crazy.

284
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,916
People were suffering.
People were fighting.

285
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,796
It was an extreme situation,
they needed an extreme solution.

286
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,796
So, according to Herodotus,
they invented dice games,

287
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,796
and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:

288
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,402
On one day, everybody would eat,

289
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,796
and on the next day,
everybody would play games.

290
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,454
And they would be so immersed
in playing the dice games,

291
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:11,922
because games are so engaging,

292
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:15,158
and immerse us in such satisfying,
blissful productivity,

293
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,896
they would ignore the fact
that they had no food to eat.

294
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,206
And then on the next day,
they would play games;

295
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,106
and on the next day, they would eat.

296
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,796
And according to Herodotus,

297
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,796
they passed 18 years this way,

298
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,559
surviving through a famine,

299
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,249
by eating on one day,
and playing games on the next.

300
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,977
Now, this is exactly, I think,
how we're using games today.

301
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:37,253
We're using games to escape
real-world suffering --

302
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:38,868
we're using games to get away

303
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:41,481
from everything that's broken
in the real environment,

304
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:44,051
everything that's not satisfying
about real life,

305
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,173
and we're getting what we need from games.

306
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:47,796
But it doesn't have to end there.

307
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,796
This is really exciting.

308
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,796
According to Herodotus, after 18 years
the famine wasn't getting better,

309
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,260
so the king decided they would
play one final dice game.

310
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,601
They divided the entire kingdom in half.

311
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,697
They played one dice game,

312
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:07,140
and the winners of that game
got to go on an epic adventure.

313
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,796
They would leave Lydia,

314
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,795
and they would go out in search
of a new place to live,

315
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:14,019
leaving behind just enough people

316
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,336
to survive on the resources
that were available,

317
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,185
and hopefully to take their civilization
somewhere else where they could thrive.

318
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,108
Now, this sounds crazy, right?

319
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:26,550
But recently, DNA evidence
has shown that the Etruscans,

320
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,336
who then led to the Roman Empire,

321
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,265
actually share the same DNA
as the ancient Lydians.

322
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,796
And so, recently,
scientists have suggested

323
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,217
that Herodotus' crazy
story is actually true.

324
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,210
And geologists have found
evidence of a global cooling

325
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:42,970
that lasted for nearly 20 years,
that could have explained the famine.

326
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:45,224
So this crazy story might be true.

327
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:49,144
They might have actually saved
their culture by playing games,

328
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,090
escaping to games for 18 years,

329
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,566
and then been so inspired,

330
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,272
and knew so much about
how to come together with games,

331
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:58,033
that they actually saved
the entire civilization that way.

332
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,222
Okay, we can do that.

333
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,268
(Laughter)

334
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,630
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.

335
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:06,325
That was the first real-time strategy
game from the World of Warcraft series.

336
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:07,748
That was 16 years ago.

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,953
They played dice games for 18 years,

338
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,223
we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.

339
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:15,405
I say we are ready for our own epic game.

340
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:20,039
Now, they had half the civilization
go off in search of a new world,

341
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,912
so that's where I get my 21 billion
hours a week of game-play from.

342
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,796
Let's get half of us to agree

343
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,796
to spend an hour a day playing games,

344
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,662
until we solve real-world problems.

345
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,258
Now, I know you're asking,

346
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:33,961
"How are we going to solve
real-world problems in games?"

347
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:37,096
Well, that's what I've devoted
my work to over the past few years,

348
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,796
at the Institute for the Future.

349
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,106
We have this banner
in our offices in Palo Alto,

350
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,955
and it expresses our view of how
we should try to relate to the future.

351
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,526
We do not want to try
to predict the future.

352
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,582
What we want to do is make the future.

353
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,098
We want to imagine
the best-case scenario outcome,

354
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:55,796
and then we want to empower people
to make that outcome a reality.

355
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,796
We want to imagine epic wins,

356
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,796
and then give people the means
to achieve the epic win.

357
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,918
I'm just going to very briefly show you
three games that I've made

358
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,998
that are an attempt to give people
the means to create epic wins

359
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:08,355
in their own futures.

360
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,796
This is World Without Oil.

361
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,511
We made this game in 2007.

362
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,893
This is an online game

363
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,637
in which you try to survive
an oil shortage.

364
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:17,922
The oil shortage is fictional,

365
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,796
but we put enough online content out there

366
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,500
for you to believe that it's real,

367
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,410
and to live your real life
as if we've run out of oil.

368
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:26,870
So when you come to the game,

369
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,823
you sign up, tell us where you live,

370
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:31,187
and then we give you
real-time news videos,

371
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,331
data feeds that show you
exactly how much oil costs,

372
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:37,084
what's not available, how food
supply is being affected,

373
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:38,942
how transportation is being affected,

374
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,037
if schools are closed, if there's rioting,

375
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:43,910
and you have to figure out
how you would live your real life

376
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,173
as if this were true.

377
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:46,996
And then we ask you to blog about it,

378
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,796
to post videos, to post photos.

379
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,220
We piloted this game
with 1,700 players in 2007,

380
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,577
and we've tracked them
for the three years since.

381
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:57,678
And I can tell you that this
is a transformative experience.

382
00:16:57,702 --> 00:16:59,585
Nobody wants to change how they live,

383
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:03,011
just because it's good for the world,
or because we're supposed to.

384
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,796
But if you immerse them
in an epic adventure

385
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,796
and tell them, "We've run out of oil.

386
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,085
This is an amazing story
and adventure for you to go on.

387
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,796
Challenge yourself to see
how you would survive,"

388
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,868
most of our players
have kept up the habits

389
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,688
that they learned in this game.

390
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,796
So for the next world-saving game,

391
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,796
we decided to aim higher --
bigger problem than just peak oil.

392
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:26,697
We did a game called Superstruct
at the Institute for the Future.

393
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:29,796
And the premise was,
a supercomputer has calculated

394
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,796
that humans have only 23 years
left on the planet.

395
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,369
This supercomputer was called

396
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,796
the Global Extinction
Awareness System, of course.

397
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,796
We asked people to come online --

398
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,919
almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

399
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,796
You know Jerry Bruckheimer
movies, you form a dream team --

400
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,571
you've got the astronaut,
the scientist, the ex-convict,

401
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,032
and they all have something
to do to save the world.

402
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,063
(Laughter)

403
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:53,475
But in our game, instead of just having
five people on the dream team,

404
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:55,428
we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,

405
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,796
and it's your job to invent
the future of energy,

406
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,796
the future of food, the future of health,

407
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,868
the future of security and the future
of the social safety net."

408
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:05,481
We had 8,000 people
play that game for eight weeks.

409
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:08,553
They came up with 500
insanely creative solutions

410
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,116
that you can go online,
Google "Superstruct," and see.

411
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,796
So, finally, the last game,

412
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,276
we're launching it March 3rd.

413
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,734
This is a game done
with the World Bank Institute.

414
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:17,962
If you complete the game,

415
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:20,796
you will be certified
by the World Bank Institute

416
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,518
as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.

417
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,796
Working with universities
all over sub-Saharan Africa,

418
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,796
and we are inviting them
to learn social innovation skills.

419
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,796
We've got a graphic novel,
we've got leveling up

420
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,796
in skills like local insight,
knowledge networking,

421
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,821
sustainability,
vision and resourcefulness.

422
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,892
I would like to invite all of you

423
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,051
to please share this game
with young people,

424
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,796
anywhere in the world,
particularly in developing areas,

425
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,018
who might benefit from coming together

426
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,751
to try to start to imagine their own
social enterprises to save the world.

427
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,983
So, I'm going to wrap up now.

428
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,796
I want to ask a question.

429
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:56,840
What do you think happens next?

430
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,849
We've got all these amazing gamers,
we've got these games

431
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,985
that are kind of pilots
of what we might do,

432
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,215
but none of them
have saved the real world yet.

433
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,588
Well I hope you will agree with me
that gamers are a human resource

434
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,796
that we can use to do real-world work,

435
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,039
that games are a powerful
platform for change.

436
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:15,389
We have all these amazing superpowers:

437
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,796
blissful productivity, the ability
to weave a tight social fabric,

438
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,796
this feeling of urgent optimism
and the desire for epic meaning.

439
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,329
I really hope that we can come together
to play games that matter,

440
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,579
to survive on this planet
for another century.

441
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:32,255
That's my hope, that you will join me
in making and playing games like this.

442
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,079
When I look forward to the next decade,
I know two things for sure:

443
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,796
that we can make
any future we can imagine,

444
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,930
and we can play any games
we want, so I say:

445
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,670
Let the world-changing games begin.

446
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:44,852
Thank you.

447
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:49,050
(Applause)
