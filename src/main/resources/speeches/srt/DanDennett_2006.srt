1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
It's wonderful to be back.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I love this wonderful gathering.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
And you must be wondering, "What on Earth?

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Have they put up the wrong slide?"

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
No, no.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,820
Look at this magnificent beast and ask the question -- who designed it?

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
This is TED.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,820
This is Technology, Entertainment, Design and there's a dairy cow.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,820
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
you know: "Poems are made by fools like me,

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
but only God can make a tree."

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
And you might say, "Well, God designed the cow."

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
But, of course, God got a lot of help.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
This is the ancestor of cattle.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
This is the Oryx.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
And it was designed by natural selection,

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,820
the process of natural selection, over many millions of years.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,820
And then it became domesticated thousands of years ago.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,820
And human beings became its stewards,

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
and, without even knowing what they were doing,

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,820
they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
And then, more recently, they really began

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,820
and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Now why am I talking about cows?

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Religions are natural phenomena.

31
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
They're just as natural as cows.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,820
They have evolved over millennia.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,820
They have a biological base, just like the Oryx.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
They have become domesticated, and human beings

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,820
have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,820
This is TED, and I want to talk about design.

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Because what I've been doing for the last four years,

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED

39
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,820
when I was talking about religion, and in the last four years

40
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
I've been working just about non-stop on this topic.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,820
or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And that is the spell that I want to break.

45
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,820
I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
We should study them with the same intensity

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
that we study all the other important natural phenomena,

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed.

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
They're immensely powerful social institutions

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,820
and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,820
that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.

53
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,820
And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design,

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,820
designed by natural selection itself, and intelligent design --

55
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,820
more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
who are trying to redesign their religions.

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,820
You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide

58
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,820
about my book, because there is one message in it

59
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
which I think this group really needs to hear.

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,820
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this.

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,820
It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book,

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,820
at this time when I claim not to know enough about religion

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
to know what other policy proposals to make.

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Here's my proposal.

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it --

67
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,820
education in world religions, on world religions, for all of our children in primary school,

68
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,820
in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
So what I'm proposing is,

70
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,820
just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,

71
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,820
so we should have a curriculum on facts

72
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
about all the religions of the world --

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,820
about their history, about their creeds, about their texts,

74
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,820
their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.

75
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,

76
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,820
with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.

77
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
And as long as you teach them that,

78
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
you can teach them anything else you like.

79
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,820
That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,820
As long as you inform your children about other religions,

81
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like --

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
teach them whatever creed you want them to learn.

83
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
But also let them know about other religions.

84
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Now why do I say that?

85
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship.

86
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Informed consent is the very bedrock

87
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
of our understanding of democracy.

88
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Misinformed consent is not worth it.

89
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count really.

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Democracy depends on informed consent.

91
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,820
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults.

92
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Now, children below the age of consent are a special case.

93
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used --

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
parents are stewards of their children.

95
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
They don't own them.

96
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
You can't own your children.

97
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
You have a responsibility to the world,

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,820
to the state, to them, to take care of them right.

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,820
You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,

100
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,820
but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed

101
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,820
about all the other creeds in the world, too.

102
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,820
The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear

103
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
some of the reactions to this.

104
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,820
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian."

105
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,820
It strikes me as practically libertarian.

106
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
I don't think so.

108
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
All I'm saying is -- facts. Facts only.

109
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,820
No values, just facts about all the world's religions.

110
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."

111
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact

112
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
that anybody would think that was hilarious.

113
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
It seems to me to be such a plausible,

114
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,820
natural extension of the democratic principles we already have,

115
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,820
that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.

116
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity

117
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
of their faith among their children that they are intent

118
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.

119
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,820
I don't think that's defensible, but I'd really be pleased

120
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later.

121
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
But now I'm going to move on.

122
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Back to the cow.

123
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
This picture, which I pulled off the web --

124
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.

125
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
That's the steward.

126
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated.

127
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,820
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.

128
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,820
They depend on us for their survival.

129
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.

130
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.

131
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.

132
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,820
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!

133
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Think of what this got them.

134
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
They could outsource all their problems --

135
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,820
protection from predators, food finding, health maintenance.

136
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,820
The only cost in most flocks is a loss of free mating.

137
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
What a deal.

138
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
"How clever of sheep!" you might say.

139
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.

140
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,820
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they're not very smart.

141
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.

142
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
They were clueless.

143
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
But it was a very clever move.

144
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Whose clever move was it?

145
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
It was a clever move of natural selection itself.

146
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA

147
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.

148
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Leslie Orgel is still a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,

149
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are.

150
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick.

151
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

152
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand

153
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,820
why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.

154
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,820
The designs discovered by the process of natural selection

155
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.

156
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
But the process itself is without purpose,

158
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
without foresight, without design.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
When I was here four years ago,

160
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
And why was the ant doing it?

162
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Well, it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was --

163
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,820
needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce.

164
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
It was sort of a spooky story.

165
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
And I think some people may have misunderstood.

166
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Lancet flukes aren't smart.

167
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there

168
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
somewhere between petunia and carrot.

169
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
They're not really bright. They don't have to be.

170
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
The lesson we learn from this is

171
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.

172
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,820
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.

173
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
It doesn't have to be.

174
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
That's the way evolution works.

175
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
The question -- was domestication good for sheep?

176
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
It was great for their genetic fitness.

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point

178
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago.

179
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Here's what he said.

180
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture,

181
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately

182
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,820
a tenth of one per cent of the terrestrial vertebrae landmass.

183
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
That was just 10,000 years ago.

184
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Yesterday, in biological terms.

185
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us?

186
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
98 percent.

187
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
That is what we have done on this planet.

188
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards.

189
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this,

190
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
and get the sources and so forth.

191
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
And he gave me a paper that he had written on this.

192
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
There was a passage in it which he did not present here

193
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
and I think it is so good I'm going to read it to you.

194
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
"Over billions of years on a unique sphere,

195
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
chance has painted a thin covering of life:

196
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.

197
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species

198
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,

199
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,820
have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power.

200
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
We now wield the paintbrush."

201
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish.

202
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet.

203
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.

204
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
And how can we do that?

205
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
The key to our domination of the planet is culture,

206
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
and the key to culture is religion.

207
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.

208
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
They would be puzzled by many things.

209
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Anybody know what this is?

210
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'll tell you what it is.

211
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,820
This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,

212
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,820
perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever,

213
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
as seen from satellite photograph.

214
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Here's a big crowd.

215
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Here's another crowd in Mecca.

216
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Martians would be amazed by this.

217
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,820
They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.

218
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Actually, I'm going to pass over this.

219
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
The ant isn't alone.

220
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species.

221
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,820
In that case, a parasite gets into a mouse

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
and it needs to get into the belly of a cat.

223
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse -- it makes it fearless,

224
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.

225
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
True story.

226
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
In other words, we have these hijackers --

227
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
you've seen this slide before, from four years ago --

228
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
a parasite that infects the brain

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause

230
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
other than one's own genetic fitness.

231
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Does that ever happen to us?

232
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.

233
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."

234
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."

235
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
But I'm not just talking about Islam.

236
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm talking also about Christianity.

237
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,820
This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago.

238
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
And on it it says, in Latin:

239
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.

240
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,820
The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ."

241
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Same idea! Well, not quite.

242
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:48,820
But in fact, Christians, too, glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God.

243
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
I'll give you a few quotes.

244
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
"The heart of worship is surrender.

245
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense."

246
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Those words are by Rick Warren.

247
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."

248
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read.

249
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
You've all got a copy.

250
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
You've just heard the man.

251
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,820
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint,

252
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
because I think it's actually a brilliant book.

253
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
First of all, the goal.

254
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
And you heard just now what the goal is.

255
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
It's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.

256
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Is it a good goal?

257
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.

258
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
He's absolutely right.

259
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life,

260
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal.

261
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
I give him an A+ on this.

262
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Is the goal achieved?

263
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Yes.

264
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
30 million copies of this book.

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Al Gore, eat your heart out.

266
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
(Laughter)

267
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing.

268
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
This is a fantastic achievement.

269
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,820
And, the means -- how does he do it?

270
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes --

271
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,

272
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
putting new interpretations on other features.

273
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years,

274
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it.

275
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I don't have to tell you this.

276
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
You've just heard the man.

277
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.

278
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,820
Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood.

279
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I really appreciated that.

280
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
For instance, he has an appendix where he explains

281
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
his choice of translations of different Bible verses.

282
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,820
The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.

283
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Just enough repetition.

284
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
That's really important.

285
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.

286
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.

287
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
(Laughter)

288
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,820
With me, everybody -- every time you read it or say it,

289
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
you make another copy in your brain.

290
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Thank you.

291
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
And now we come to my problem.

292
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation

293
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
of all that I've said about this book.

294
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
But I wish it were better.

295
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
I have some problems with the book.

296
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,820
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.

297
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,820
I wish he could do this with a revision,

298
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
a Mark 2 version of his book.

299
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
"The truth will set you free" --

300
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,820
that's what it says in the Bible, and it's something that I want to live by, too.

301
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.

302
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Now some of this is a difference of opinion,

303
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
and that's not my main complaint.

304
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
That's worth mentioning.

305
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
Here's a passage -- it's very much what he said, anyway.

306
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
"If there was no God we would all be accidents,

307
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.

308
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
You could stop reading this book because life

309
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,820
would have no purpose or meaning or significance.

310
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,820
There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth."

311
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Now, I just do not believe that.

312
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,820
By the way, I find Homer Groening's film

313
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim.

314
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.

315
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,820
We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.

316
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,820
But that is just a difference of opinion.

317
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
That's not what I'm really worried about.

318
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,820
How about this -- "God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it."

319
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,820
I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean

320
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore

321
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
is trying so hard to get us to do.

322
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm not happy with that sentiment at all.

323
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,820
And then I find this -- "All the evidence available in the biological sciences

324
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole

325
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose,

326
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning

327
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
and explanation in this central fact."

328
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.

329
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
And here I think, "Wait a minute."

330
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
I read this again.

331
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
I read it three or four times and I think,

332
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
"Is he really endorsing intelligent design?

333
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Is he endorsing creationism here?"

334
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
And you can't tell.

335
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know,

336
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."

337
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,820
But then I read on and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain,

338
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,820
because prior to the flood God irrigated the earth from the ground up."

339
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.

340
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,820
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,

341
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
after we've just been hearing about the history

342
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
of the planet over millions of years,

343
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,820
discourages people from scientific understanding.

344
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:08,820
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids

345
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
and information in a very interesting way.

346
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Here's one: "God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him

347
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
in a way that makes your ministry unique.

348
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,820
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you."

349
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
I think that's false.

350
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.

351
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Here's another one -- "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.

352
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."

353
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that.

354
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
There might be some way of treating that as true.

355
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,820
"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,

356
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being,

357
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
an inbuilt need to connect with God."

358
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Well, there's a sense which I agree with him,

359
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.

360
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,820
And what I find deeply troubling in this book

361
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,820
is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,

362
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
if you want to have meaning in your life,

363
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,820
you have to be an Intelligent Designer -- you have to deny

364
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,820
the theory of evolution by natural selection.

365
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,820
And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important to solving

366
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,820
the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously.

367
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Whose truth are we going to listen to?

368
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Well, this from "The Purpose Driven Life" --

369
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life,

370
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,820
the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to

371
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,820
for making wise decisions and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."

372
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?

373
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
And here's one that does concern me.

374
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Remember I quoted him before with this line --

375
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,820
"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."

376
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
And that's a problem.

377
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,820
"Don't ever argue with the Devil.

378
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,820
He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands of years to practice."

379
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,820
Now Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.

380
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
It's an old move.

381
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,820
It's a very clever adaptation of religions.

382
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,820
It's a wildcard for disarming any reasonable criticism.

383
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
"You don't like my interpretation?

384
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
You've got a reasonable objection to it?

385
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Don't listen, don't listen!

386
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
That's the Devil speaking."

387
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,820
This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship

388
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,820
it seems to me that we want to have.

389
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,820
I've got one more problem, then I'm through.

390
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,820
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.

391
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations

392
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,820
and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father,

393
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,820
the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do everything I've told you.'"

394
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,820
The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world.

395
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Now here we've seen many wonderful maps of the world

396
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
in the last day or so.

397
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Here's one, not as beautiful as the others.

398
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,820
It simply shows the religions of the world.

399
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,820
And here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.

400
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Now do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing

401
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,820
all the other religions when their holy books are telling them,

402
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,820
"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"

403
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,820
It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship

404
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,820
to get on for the future.

405
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,820
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently,

406
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
in front of a church -- "Good without God becomes zero."

407
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
Sort of cute.

408
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
A very clever little meme.

409
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,820
I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is -- not in this guise

410
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,820
but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face.

411
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:15,820
If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged

412
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,820
atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God.

413
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,820
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity

414
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
instead of doing good works.

415
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,820
So, I wish we could drop this meme.

416
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
I wish this meme would go extinct.

417
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
Thanks very much for your attention.

418
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,820
(Applause)
