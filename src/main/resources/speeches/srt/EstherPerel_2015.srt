1
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,169
Why do we cheat?

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,748
And why do happy people cheat?

3
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:25,267
And when we say "infidelity,"
what exactly do we mean?

4
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:32,406
Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room,

5
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,445
a massage with a happy ending?

6
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:41,314
Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

7
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:46,076
but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy?

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,819
And is an affair always
the end of a relationship?

9
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:56,310
For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,355
and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples

11
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:01,542
who have been shattered by infidelity.

12
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,422
There is one simple act of transgression

13
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:10,810
that can rob a couple
of their relationship,

14
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:15,065
their happiness and their
very identity: an affair.

15
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:20,937
And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood.

16
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:27,044
So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved.

17
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:33,345
Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented,

18
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,890
and so, too, the taboo against it.

19
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:42,647
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy,

20
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:46,105
so much so, that this is
the only commandment

21
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:50,041
that is repeated twice in the Bible:

22
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,145
once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it.

23
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,415
(Laughter)

24
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,742
So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden,

25
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:03,187
yet universally practiced?

26
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:09,856
Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat

27
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:12,151
with little consequence,

28
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,559
and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories

29
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,135
that justified their need to roam,

30
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:23,112
so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself.

31
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:29,536
But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right?

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,572
Because when it comes to sex,

33
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:35,759
the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate,

34
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,304
but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny,

35
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:45,530
which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries

36
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,054
where women can be killed for straying.

37
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:54,240
Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life.

38
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,335
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.

39
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,953
(Laughter)

40
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,843
(Applause)

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,120
I mean, many of you probably have said,

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,708
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,683
(Laughter)

44
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,080
We used to marry,

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,989
and had sex for the first time.

46
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,896
But now we marry,

47
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,823
and we stop having sex with others.

48
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:25,497
The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love.

49
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,715
Men relied on women's fidelity

50
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,779
in order to know whose children these are,

51
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,120
and who gets the cows when I die.

52
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:38,475
Now, everyone wants to know

53
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:40,223
what percentage of people cheat.

54
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,454
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.

55
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:46,056
(Laughter)

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,460
It applies to you.

57
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:52,779
But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding:

58
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:57,841
sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps.

59
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:02,637
So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition

60
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,776
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

61
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:11,406
estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent.

62
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,779
But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions.

63
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,612
So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong

64
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:22,789
for our partner to lie
about having an affair,

65
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,010
but just about the same
amount of us will say

66
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:28,168
that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one.

67
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,628
(Laughter)

68
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:35,397
Now, I like this definition
of an affair --

69
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:39,146
it brings together the three key elements:

70
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:44,852
a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair;

71
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:49,646
an emotional connection
to one degree or another;

72
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,286
and a sexual alchemy.

73
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,157
And alchemy is the key word here,

74
00:04:55,157 --> 00:05:02,085
because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving,

75
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,169
can be as powerful and as enchanting

76
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,659
as hours of actual lovemaking.

77
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,135
As Marcel Proust said,

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,460
it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person.

79
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:21,578
So it's never been easier to cheat,

80
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:25,055
and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret.

81
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,279
And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll.

82
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:35,162
When marriage was an economic enterprise,

83
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:38,128
infidelity threatened
our economic security.

84
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,779
But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement,

85
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,599
infidelity threatens
our emotional security.

86
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,860
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --

87
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,089
that was the space where
we sought pure love.

88
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,302
But now that we seek love in marriage,

89
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,962
adultery destroys it.

90
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:03,167
Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today.

91
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,433
We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person

92
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:14,630
to fulfill an endless list of needs:

93
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,230
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,

94
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,383
the best parent, my trusted confidant,

95
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:24,477
my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal.

96
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:29,749
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,

97
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:33,065
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,

98
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,255
I'm the one.

99
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:38,334
And infidelity tells me I'm not.

100
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:41,017
It is the ultimate betrayal.

101
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,945
Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love.

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,381
But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful,

103
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,739
today it is often traumatic,

104
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:56,540
because it threatens our sense of self.

105
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,643
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.

106
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,415
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.

107
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:06,621
I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was.

108
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,842
Now, I question everything."

109
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:14,639
Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity.

110
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,944
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

111
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,270
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

112
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,725
And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me,

113
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,352
when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick.

114
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:27,802
Married, two kids.

115
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:30,479
Nick just left on a business trip,

116
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,010
and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys,

117
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,947
when she sees a message
appear on the screen:

118
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,485
"Can't wait to see you."

119
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:41,874
Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other.

120
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,199
And then another message:

121
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,960
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."

122
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,063
And Heather realizes

123
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:51,431
these are not for her.

124
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:55,628
She also tells me
that her father had affairs,

125
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:59,573
but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket,

126
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,755
and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar.

127
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,430
Heather, she goes digging,

128
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,493
and she finds hundreds of messages,

129
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,906
and photos exchanged
and desires expressed.

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,938
The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair

131
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:19,120
unfold in front of her in real time,

132
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,092
And it made me think:

133
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:26,138
Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts.

134
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,933
But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days.

135
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,237
Because of this romantic ideal,

136
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:38,295
we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor.

137
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,364
But we also have never
been more inclined to stray,

138
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:45,075
and not because we have new desires today,

139
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,821
but because we live in an era

140
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:50,502
where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires,

141
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:53,958
because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy.

142
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,851
And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy,

143
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,684
today we divorce
because we could be happier.

144
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,667
And if divorce carried all the shame,

145
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,558
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

146
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:11,922
is the new shame.

147
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,988
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends

148
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,249
because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick,

149
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:21,797
and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice:

150
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:24,422
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

151
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:30,557
And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation.

152
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,184
Staying is the new shame.

153
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:38,179
So if we can divorce,

154
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,275
why do we still have affairs?

155
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:46,383
Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats,

156
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:50,228
either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you.

157
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,506
But millions of people
can't all be pathological.

158
00:09:56,203 --> 00:10:00,111
The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home,

159
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:03,535
then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere,

160
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:07,002
assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage

161
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,858
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

162
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,319
But what if passion
has a finite shelf life?

163
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:19,158
What if there are things
that even a good relationship

164
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,563
can never provide?

165
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,022
If even happy people cheat,

166
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:26,618
what is it about?

167
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:31,461
The vast majority of people
that I actually work with

168
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:34,245
are not at all chronic philanderers.

169
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:38,295
They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs,

170
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:39,868
and at least for their partner.

171
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:43,321
But they find themselves in a conflict

172
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:46,360
between their values and their behavior.

173
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:51,755
They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades,

174
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:54,394
but one day they cross a line

175
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,867
that they never thought they would cross,

176
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,614
and at the risk of losing everything.

177
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,455
But for a glimmer of what?

178
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,429
Affairs are an act of betrayal,

179
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,525
and they are also an expression
of longing and loss.

180
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,348
At the heart of an affair,
you will often find

181
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:18,609
a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection,

182
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:24,379
for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity,

183
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,046
a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves

184
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:33,360
or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.

185
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,586
I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya,

186
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,202
who is blissfully married,

187
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,667
loves her husband,

188
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,050
and would never want to hurt the man.

189
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,651
But she also tells me

190
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:49,825
that she's always done
what was expected of her:

191
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:53,505
good girl, good wife, good mother,

192
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,497
taking care of her immigrant parents.

193
00:11:56,497 --> 00:12:01,009
Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard

194
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,495
after Hurricane Sandy.

195
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:07,907
And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her.

196
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:14,589
But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had.

197
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:20,850
And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another,

198
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,568
it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from,

199
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,405
but the person that
we have ourselves become.

200
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,094
And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person,

201
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:36,636
as much as we are
looking for another self.

202
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,422
Now, all over the world,

203
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:44,278
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.

204
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,731
They feel alive.

205
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:52,106
And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses --

206
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,961
of a parent who died,

207
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,161
and a friend that went too soon,

208
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:57,961
and bad news at the doctor.

209
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:03,958
Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair,

210
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,428
because they raise these questions.

211
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,356
Is this it? Is there more?

212
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,777
Am I going on for another
25 years like this?

213
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,182
Will I ever feel that thing again?

214
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,608
And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions

215
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:25,767
are the ones that propel
people to cross the line,

216
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:29,759
and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness,

217
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,555
in an antidote to death.

218
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,687
And contrary to what you may think,

219
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:41,723
affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire:

220
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:45,212
desire for attention,
desire to feel special,

221
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:47,128
desire to feel important.

222
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:51,067
And the very structure of an affair,

223
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,319
the fact that you can
never have your lover,

224
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,758
keeps you wanting.

225
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:57,779
That in itself is a desire machine,

226
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,567
because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

227
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,342
keeps you wanting
that which you can't have.

228
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:06,997
Now some of you probably think

229
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,627
that affairs don't happen
in open relationships,

230
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:11,818
but they do.

231
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,382
First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same

232
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,563
as the conversation about infidelity.

233
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:21,779
But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have

234
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,452
the freedom to have other sexual partners,

235
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:28,540
we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden,

236
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,027
that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do,

237
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,826
then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to.

238
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,755
And I've also told
quite a few of my patients

239
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:45,356
that if they could bring
into their relationships

240
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:48,987
one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve

241
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,699
that they put into their affairs,

242
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,944
they probably would never need to see me.

243
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,968
(Laughter)

244
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,467
So how do we heal from an affair?

245
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:02,167
Desire runs deep.

246
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:04,062
Betrayal runs deep.

247
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,641
But it can be healed.

248
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,740
And some affairs are death knells

249
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:13,502
for relationships that were
already dying on the vine.

250
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,589
But others will jolt us
into new possibilities.

251
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:19,756
The fact is, the majority of couples

252
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,970
who have experienced
affairs stay together.

253
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,219
But some of them will merely survive,

254
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:29,923
and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

255
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:34,280
They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience.

256
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:38,018
And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner,

257
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,378
who will often say,

258
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,185
"You think I didn't want more?

259
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,027
But I'm not the one who did it."

260
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,930
But now that the affair is exposed,

261
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,064
they, too, get to claim more,

262
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,706
and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo

263
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:53,620
that may not have been working
for them that well, either.

264
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,930
I've noticed that a lot of couples,

265
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,071
in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

266
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:05,407
because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order,

267
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:08,989
will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness

268
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,644
that they haven't had in decades.

269
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,500
And, partners who were
sexually indifferent

270
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,099
find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious,

271
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,634
they don't know where it's coming from.

272
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:24,341
Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire,

273
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:27,660
and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth.

274
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:32,824
So when an affair is exposed,

275
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,985
what are some of the specific things
that couples can do?

276
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:42,024
We know from trauma that healing begins

277
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:46,016
when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing.

278
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,870
So for the partner who had the affair,

279
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,402
for Nick,

280
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,207
one thing is to end the affair,

281
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:58,929
but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing

282
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,135
guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.

283
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,084
But the truth is

284
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,185
that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs

285
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,283
may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner,

286
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:13,496
but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself.

287
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,796
And that distinction is important.

288
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,676
And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship.

289
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,146
He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries.

290
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,769
It's his responsibility to bring it up,

291
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,749
because if he thinks about it,

292
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:31,759
he can relieve Heather from the obsession,

293
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,969
and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten,

294
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,152
and that in itself
begins to restore trust.

295
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,249
But for Heather,

296
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:42,994
or deceived partners,

297
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:48,332
it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth,

298
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:52,065
to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities

299
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,472
that give back joy
and meaning and identity.

300
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,689
But even more important,

301
00:17:57,689 --> 00:18:02,592
is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details --

302
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,789
Where were you? Where did you do it?

303
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,811
How often? Is she better
than me in bed? --

304
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,295
questions that only inflict more pain,

305
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,779
and keep you awake at night.

306
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:17,170
And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions,

307
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,470
the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives --

308
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,947
What did this affair mean for you?

309
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:25,719
What were you able to express
or experience there

310
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,974
that you could no longer do with me?

311
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,006
What was it like for you
when you came home?

312
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:34,405
What is it about us that you value?

313
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,557
Are you pleased this is over?

314
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:42,545
Every affair will redefine a relationship,

315
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:45,427
and every couple will determine

316
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,962
what the legacy of the affair will be.

317
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:53,231
But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away.

318
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,779
And the dilemmas of love and desire,

319
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,749
they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad,

320
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,723
and victim and perpetrator.

321
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:10,116
Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms.

322
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,470
There are many ways
that we betray our partner:

323
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,639
with contempt, with neglect,

324
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:17,112
with indifference, with violence.

325
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:21,257
Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner.

326
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,861
In other words, the victim of an affair

327
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,803
is not always the victim of the marriage.

328
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,868
Now, you've listened to me,

329
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,243
and I know what you're thinking:

330
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:38,017
She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair.

331
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,819
(Laughter)

332
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,085
So, you're wrong.

333
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,994
I am not French.

334
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,939
(Laughter)

335
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,843
(Applause)

336
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:55,089
And I'm not pro-affair.

337
00:19:56,494 --> 00:20:00,878
But because I think that good
can come out of an affair,

338
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:04,209
I have often been asked
this very strange question:

339
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,970
Would I ever recommend it?

340
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:10,325
Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair

341
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,869
than I would recommend you have cancer,

342
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:15,572
and yet we know that people
who have been ill

343
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:19,770
often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective.

344
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,726
The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference

345
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:27,237
when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against?

346
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,569
I said, "Yes."

347
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:32,403
(Laughter)

348
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:37,325
I look at affairs from a dual perspective:

349
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:40,973
hurt and betrayal on one side,

350
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,329
growth and self-discovery on the other --

351
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:47,425
what it did to you,
and what it meant for me.

352
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:53,109
And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair

353
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,912
that has been revealed,

354
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,240
I will often tell them this:

355
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,645
Today in the West,

356
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:04,524
most of us are going to have
two or three relationships

357
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,223
or marriages,

358
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,358
and some of us are going
to do it with the same person.

359
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,731
Your first marriage is over.

360
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:16,294
Would you like to create
a second one together?

361
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,415
Thank you.

362
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:25,073
