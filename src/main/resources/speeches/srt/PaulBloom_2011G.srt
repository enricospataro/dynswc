1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I'm going to talk today

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
about the pleasures of everyday life.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
But I want to begin with a story

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
of an unusual and terrible man.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
This is Hermann Goering.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
his designated successor.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
And like Hitler,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
Goering fancied himself a collector of art.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
He went through Europe, through World War II,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
stealing, extorting and occasionally buying

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
various paintings for his collection.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
So he finally found an art dealer,

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
who sold him a wonderful Vermeer

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And it was his favorite artwork ever.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
World War II came to an end,

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
and Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and ultimately sentenced to death.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Then the Allied forces went through his collections

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
and found the paintings

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
and went after the people who sold it to him.

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
and arrested Van Meegeren.

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
which is itself punishable by death.

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Six weeks into his prison sentence,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
van Meegeren confessed.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
But he didn't confess to treason.

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
to that Nazi.

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Now nobody believed him.

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
And he said, "I'll prove it.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Bring me a canvas and some paint,

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
and I will paint a Vermeer much better

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
than I sold that disgusting Nazi.

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
(Laughter)

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
So they brought him in.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
And then the charges of treason were dropped.

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
He had a lesser charge of forgery,

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
got a year sentence

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and died a hero to the Dutch people.

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
but I want to turn now to Goering,

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
His American interrogators described him

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
as an amicable psychopath.

56
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
But you could feel sympathy

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
for the reaction he had

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
when he was told that his favorite painting

59
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
was actually a forgery.

60
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
According to his biographer,

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
"He looked as if for the first time

62
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
he had discovered there was evil in the world."

63
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
(Laughter)

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
And he killed himself soon afterwards.

65
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
He had discovered after all

66
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
that the painting he thought was this

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
was actually that.

68
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
It looked the same,

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
that he himself had painted

74
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
that were attributed to other artists.

75
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work --

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
people would come [from] all over the world to see it --

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
was actually a forgery.

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
It was not that painting, but that painting.

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
And when that was discovered,

81
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
Why does this matter?

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much?

84
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Why do we respond so much

85
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
to our knowledge of where something comes from?

86
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Well there's an answer that many people would give.

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe

88
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously

89
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
is because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.

90
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Among other things,

91
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
it's always better to own an original than a forgery

93
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.

94
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
I don't doubt that that plays some role,

95
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
but what I want to convince you of today

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
is that there's something else going on.

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
I want to convince you

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
What I mean by this

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
is we don't just respond to things as we see them,

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
or feel them, or hear them.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
about what they really are, what they came from,

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.

105
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
I want to suggest that this is true,

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
not just for how we think about things,

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
but how we react to things.

108
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep --

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
and that this isn't true

110
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
just for higher level pleasures like art,

111
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
but even the most seemingly simple pleasures

112
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.

113
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
So take food.

114
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Would you eat this?

115
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"

116
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Some of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Some of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.

118
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat

119
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
or a human.

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
That's not so surprising.

122
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
But what's more interesting

123
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
is how it tastes to you

124
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
will depend critically on what you think you're eating.

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
So one demonstration of this was done with young children.

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
How do you make children

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk --

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
to think they taste better?

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.

131
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
They believe McDonald's food is tastier,

132
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
and it leads them to experience it as tastier.

133
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?

134
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
It's very simple:

135
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
pour it from an expensive bottle.

136
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing

137
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
it tastes better to you.

139
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.

140
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
They get people into a fMRI scanner,

141
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
and while they're lying there, through a tube,

142
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
they get to sip wine.

143
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Everybody, of course,

145
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
drinks exactly the same wine.

146
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,

147
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward

148
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
light up like a Christmas tree.

149
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,

150
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
you really experience it in a different way.

151
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Or take sex.

152
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.

153
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,820
And if you simply show people these pictures,

154
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
they'll say these are fairly attractive people.

155
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
But how attractive you find them,

156
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
how sexually or romantically moved you are by them,

157
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
rests critically on who you think you're looking at.

158
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
You probably think the picture on the left is male,

159
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
the one on the right is female.

160
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.

161
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
(Laughter)

162
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
It will make a difference if they turn out to be

163
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
much younger or much older than you think they are.

164
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
It will make a difference if you were to discover

165
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
that the person you're looking at with lust

166
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,

167
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
your mother or father.

168
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.

169
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Maybe one of the most heartening findings

170
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
from the psychology of pleasure

171
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.

172
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
If you like somebody, they look better to you.

173
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
This is why spouses in happy marriages

174
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
tend to think that their husband or wife

175
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.

176
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
(Laughter)

177
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
A particularly dramatic example of this

178
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.

179
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder

180
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
where you get a specific delusion.

181
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Sufferers of Capgras syndrome

182
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
believe that the people they love most in the world

183
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
have been replaced by perfect duplicates.

184
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.

185
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
People have murdered those that they loved,

186
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
believing that they were murdering an imposter.

187
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
But there's at least one case

188
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.

189
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
This was recorded in 1931.

190
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome

191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."

192
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.

193
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
After she got it, "She was happy to report

194
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
that she has discovered that he possessed a double

195
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."

196
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Of course, it was the same man,

197
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
but she was seeing him in different ways.

198
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
As a third example,

199
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
consider consumer products.

200
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
So one reason why you might like something is its utility.

201
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;

202
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.

203
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
But each of these three objects has value

204
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
above and beyond what it can do for you

205
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
based on its history.

206
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy

207
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.

208
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears

209
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
and sold for several hundreds of dollars.

210
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
And in fact, there's a thriving market

211
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
in the partially eaten food of beloved people.

212
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
(Laughter)

213
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,820
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.

214
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
According to an unconfirmed report,

215
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars

216
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
for this pair of shoes.

217
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
They were the ones thrown at George Bush

218
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
at an Iraqi press conference several years ago.

219
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
(Applause)

220
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Now this attraction to objects

221
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
doesn't just work for celebrity objects.

222
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Each one of us, most people,

223
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,

224
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
in that it has value because of its history --

225
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
maybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes --

226
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
so that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.

227
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it,

228
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
but you couldn't get the same object back.

229
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,

230
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters

231
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
for the objects that people like.

232
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
So in one of our experiments,

233
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
we asked people to name a famous person who they adored,

234
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
a living person they adored.

235
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
So one answer was George Clooney.

236
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
Then we asked them,

237
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"

238
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
And the answer is a fair amount --

239
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
more than you would pay for a brand new sweater

240
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.

241
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Then we asked other groups of subjects --

242
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
we gave them different restrictions

243
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
and different conditions.

244
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
So for instance, we told some people,

245
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
"Look, you can buy the sweater,

246
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
but you can't tell anybody you own it,

247
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
and you can't resell it."

248
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
That drops the value of it,

249
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.

250
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
But what really causes an effect

251
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,

252
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
but before it gets to you,

253
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
it's thoroughly washed."

254
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
That causes a huge drop in the value.

255
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."

256
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
(Laughter)

257
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
So let's go back to art.

258
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.

259
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference,

260
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
you could buy me a Chagall.

261
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
But I don't want a duplicate,

262
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
even if I can't tell the difference.

263
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
That's not because, or it's not simply because,

264
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.

265
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.

266
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
In the case of artwork,

267
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
the history is special indeed.

268
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
The philosopher Denis Dutton

269
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
makes the case that, "The value of an artwork

271
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."

272
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
And that could explain the difference

273
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
between an original and a forgery.

274
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
They may look alike, but they have a different history.

275
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
The original is typically the product of a creative act,

276
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
the forgery isn't.

277
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
I think this approach can explain differences

278
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
in people's taste in art.

279
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.

280
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?

281
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?

282
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
They just don't like it.

283
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm not going to make a claim about who's right,

284
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
but I will make an empirical claim

285
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
about people's intuitions,

286
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,

287
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it

288
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
to believe that these works are difficult to create,

289
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
that they require a lot of time and energy

290
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
and creative energy.

291
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example

292
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
because there's a young American artist

293
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,

294
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
and her work was worth

295
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
many tens of thousands of dollars --

296
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
in large part because she's a very young artist.

297
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
This is Marla Olmstead

298
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
who did most of her work when she was three years old.

299
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead

300
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
is her family made the mistake

301
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,820
of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house

302
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
to film her painting.

303
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
And they then reported that her father was coaching her.

304
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
When this came out on television,

305
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
the value of her art dropped to nothing.

306
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
It was the same art, physically,

307
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
but the history had changed.

308
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
I've been focusing now on the visual arts,

309
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
but I want to give two examples from music.

310
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.

311
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten

312
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.

313
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,

314
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
the music of Joshua Bell,

315
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?

316
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin

317
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
down to a Washington D.C. subway station

318
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.

319
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
And here's a brief clip of this.

320
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,820
(Violin music)

321
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
After being there for three-quarters of an hour,

322
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
he made 32 dollars.

323
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Not bad. It's also not good.

324
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,

325
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.

326
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
He actually made 20 dollars more than that,

327
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
but he didn't count it.

328
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Because this woman comes up --

329
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
you see at the end of the video -- she comes up.

330
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before

331
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
at this extravagant black-tie affair.

332
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.

333
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
So she's struck with pity.

334
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.

335
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
(Laughter)

336
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
(Applause)

337
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
The second example from music

338
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
is from John Cage's modernist composition,

339
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
"4'33"."

340
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
As many of you know,

341
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,

342
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
opens up the piano

343
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds --

344
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
that period of silence.

345
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And people have different views on this.

346
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
But what I want to point out

347
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
is you can buy this from iTunes.

348
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
(Laughter)

349
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
For a dollar 99,

350
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
you can listen to that silence,

351
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
which is different than other forms of silence.

352
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
(Laughter)

353
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Now I've been talking so far about pleasure,

354
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
but what I want to suggest

355
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
is that everything I've said applies as well to pain.

356
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
And how you think about what you're experiencing,

357
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
your beliefs about the essence of it,

358
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
affect how it hurts.

359
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
One lovely experiment

360
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.

361
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates

362
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
to an electric shock machine.

363
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.

364
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
So it was a series of five painful shocks.

365
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks

366
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
by somebody in another room,

367
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.

368
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.

369
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
The first shock is recorded as very painful.

370
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.

371
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.

372
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
The pain gets less.

373
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
In the other condition,

374
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
they're told that the person in the next room

375
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them.

376
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
The first shock hurts like hell.

377
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
The second shock hurts just as much,

378
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
and the third and the fourth and the fifth.

379
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
It hurts more

380
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,820
if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.

381
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
The most extreme example of this

382
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
is that in some cases,

383
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
pain under the right circumstances

384
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
can transform into pleasure.

385
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property

386
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
that will often seek out low-level doses of pain

387
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
in controlled circumstances

388
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
and take pleasure from it --

389
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
as in the eating of hot chili peppers

390
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
and roller coaster rides.

391
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
The point was nicely summarized

392
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
by the poet John Milton

393
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
who wrote, "The mind is its own place,

394
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
and in itself can make a heaven of hell,

395
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
a hell of heaven."

396
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
And I'll end with that. Thank you.

397
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,820
