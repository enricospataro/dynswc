1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,922
I'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.

2
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:21,126
I like special missions
and secret objectives.

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,817
So here's my special mission
for this talk:

4
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:29,591
I'm going to try to increase the life span
of every single person in this room

5
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,778
by seven and a half minutes.

6
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:34,922
Literally, you will live seven
and a half minutes longer

7
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:36,397
than you would have otherwise,

8
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,127
just because you watched this talk.

9
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:41,570
Some of you are looking
a little bit skeptical.

10
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,310
That's okay, because check it out --

11
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,087
I have math to prove that it is possible.

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,584
It won't make much sense now.

13
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:48,920
I'll explain it all later,

14
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:51,183
just pay attention
to the number at the bottom:

15
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,483
+7.68245837 minutes.

16
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:58,002
That will be my gift to you
if I'm successful in my mission.

17
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:01,195
Now, you have a secret mission too.

18
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,730
Your mission is to figure out
how you want to spend

19
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,794
your extra seven and a half minutes.

20
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,366
And I think you should do
something unusual with them,

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,920
because these are bonus minutes.

22
00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:12,912
You weren't going to have them anyway.

23
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:16,936
Now, because I'm a game designer,
you might be thinking to yourself,

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,381
I know what she wants us to do
with those minutes,

25
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,532
she wants us to spend them playing games.

26
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:24,018
Now this is a totally
reasonable assumption,

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,804
given that I have made quite
a habit of encouraging people

28
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,450
to spend more time playing games.

29
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,730
For example, in my first TED Talk,

30
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,921
I did propose that we should spend
21 billion hours a week,

31
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:37,042
as a planet, playing video games.

32
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,429
Now, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.

33
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:44,763
It's so much time, in fact,
that the number one unsolicited comment

34
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:47,065
that I have heard from people
all over the world

35
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,946
since I gave that talk, is this:

36
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:53,256
Jane, games are great and all,
but on your deathbed,

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,777
are you really going to wish you spent
more time playing Angry Birds?

38
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:57,801
(Laughter)

39
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,950
This idea is so pervasive --

40
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,868
that games are a waste of time
that we will come to regret --

41
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:05,041
that I hear it literally everywhere I go.

42
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:06,960
For example, true story:

43
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,324
Just a few weeks ago,

44
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:11,674
this cab driver, upon finding out
that a friend and I were in town

45
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,587
for a game developers' conference,

46
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,682
turned around and said -- and I quote --

47
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:19,272
"I hate games. Waste of life.

48
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:23,900
Imagine getting to the end of your life
and regretting all that time."

49
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:27,149
Now, I want to take
this problem seriously.

50
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,704
I want games to be
a force for good in the world.

51
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,504
I don't want gamers to regret
the time they spent playing,

52
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,630
time that I encouraged them to spend.

53
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,713
So I have been thinking about this
question a lot lately.

54
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,076
When we're on our deathbeds,

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,977
will we regret the time
we spent playing games?

56
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,210
Now, this may surprise you,
but it turns out

57
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:49,378
there is actually some scientific research
on this question.

58
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,651
It's true.

59
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,266
Hospice workers,

60
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,201
the people who take care of us
at the end of our lives,

61
00:02:55,225 --> 00:03:00,002
recently issued a report
on the most frequently expressed regrets

62
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:03,735
that people say when they are
literally on their deathbeds.

63
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,521
And that's what I want
to share with you today --

64
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,688
the top five regrets of the dying.

65
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,672
Number one:

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,426
I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

67
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:18,676
Number two:

68
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,087
I wish I had stayed
in touch with my friends.

69
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,297
Number three:

70
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,788
I wish I had let myself be happier.

71
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,729
Number four:

72
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,940
I wish I'd had the courage
to express my true self.

73
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,089
And number five:

74
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,797
I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,

75
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,826
instead of what others expected of me.

76
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:47,407
Now, as far as I know, no one ever
told one of the hospice workers,

77
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:50,502
"I wish I'd spent more
time playing video games,"

78
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:53,106
but when I hear these top five
regrets of the dying,

79
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,922
I can't help but hear
five deep human cravings

80
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,946
that games actually help us fulfill.

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,641
For example, I wish
I hadn't worked so hard.

82
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,372
For many people, this means,
I wish I'd spent more time

83
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:06,085
with my family, with my kids
when they were growing up.

84
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,258
Well, we know that playing games together
has tremendous family benefits.

85
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:13,680
A recent study from Brigham
Young University School of Family Life

86
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,927
reported that parents who spend more time
playing video games with their kids

87
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,010
have much stronger
real-life relationships with them.

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,222
"I wish I'd stayed in touch
with my friends."

89
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,690
Hundreds of millions of people

90
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:29,852
use social games like FarmVille
or Words With Friends

91
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:33,181
to stay in daily contact
with real-life friends and family.

92
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,673
A recent study from
the University of Michigan

93
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:42,957
showed that these games are incredibly
powerful relationship-management tools.

94
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:47,229
They help us stay connected
with people in our social network

95
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,349
that we would otherwise grow distant from,

96
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,174
if we weren't playing games together.

97
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,466
"I wish I'd let myself be happier."

98
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,871
Well, here I can't help but think
of the groundbreaking clinical trials

99
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,799
recently conducted
at East Carolina University

100
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:02,674
that showed that online games
can outperform

101
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,416
pharmaceuticals for treating
clinical anxiety and depression.

102
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:09,947
Just 30 minutes of online game play a day

103
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,944
was enough to create
dramatic boosts in mood

104
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,529
and long-term increases in happiness.

105
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:20,000
"I wish I'd had the courage
to express my true self."

106
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:23,658
Well, avatars are a way
to express our true selves,

107
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:27,014
our most heroic, idealized
version of who we might become.

108
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,656
You can see that in this alter ego
portrait by Robbie Cooper

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,786
of a gamer with his avatar.

110
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,650
And Stanford University has been
doing research for five years now

111
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:40,827
to document how playing a game
with an idealized avatar

112
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,621
changes how we think and act in real life,

113
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,605
making us more courageous, more ambitious,

114
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,796
more committed to our goals.

115
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,364
"I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,

116
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:54,194
and not what others expected of me."

117
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,500
Are games doing this yet?

118
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm not sure, so I've left
a Super Mario question mark.

119
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,818
We're going to come back to this one.

120
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,881
But in the meantime,
perhaps you're wondering,

121
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,840
who is this game designer
to be talking to us

122
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:09,287
about deathbed regrets?

123
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:13,033
And it's true, I've never
worked in a hospice,

124
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:15,186
I've never been on my deathbed.

125
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,263
But recently I did spend
three months in bed, wanting to die.

126
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,693
Really wanting to die.

127
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,580
Now let me tell you that story.

128
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:29,541
It started two years ago, when I hit
my head and got a concussion.

129
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,338
The concussion didn't heal properly,

130
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:35,119
and after 30 days, I was left
with symptoms like nonstop headaches,

131
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:37,881
nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.

132
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,869
My doctor told me that in order
to heal my brain,

133
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:41,917
I had to rest it.

134
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,574
So I had to avoid everything
that triggered my symptoms.

135
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,469
For me that meant no reading,
no writing, no video games,

136
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,549
no work or email, no running,
no alcohol, no caffeine.

137
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,542
In other words -- and I think
you see where this is going --

138
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:54,646
no reason to live.

139
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,671
(Laughter)

140
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,536
Of course it's meant to be funny,

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,454
but in all seriousness,
suicidal ideation is quite common

142
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,123
with traumatic brain injuries.

143
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,636
It happens to one in three,
and it happened to me.

144
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:11,636
My brain started telling me,
"Jane, you want to die."

145
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,717
It said, "You're never going
to get better."

146
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:18,542
It said, "The pain will never end."

147
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:23,362
And these voices became
so persistent and so persuasive

148
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:28,495
that I started to legitimately
fear for my life,

149
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,996
which is the time that I said
to myself after 34 days --

150
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,083
and I will never forget this moment --

151
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:38,490
I said, "I am either going to kill myself

152
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:41,117
or I'm going to turn this into a game."

153
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:42,286
Now, why a game?

154
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,414
I knew from researching the psychology
of games for more than a decade

155
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,145
that when we play a game --

156
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,200
and this is
in the scientific literature --

157
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,993
we tackle tough challenges
with more creativity,

158
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,694
more determination, more optimism,

159
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:57,266
and we're more likely
to reach out to others for help.

160
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,309
I wanted to bring these gamer traits
to my real-life challenge,

161
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,329
so I created a role-playing recovery game

162
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,237
called Jane the Concussion Slayer.

163
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,055
Now this became my new secret identity,

164
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,479
and the first thing I did as a slayer
was call my twin sister --

165
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,811
I have an identical
twin sister named Kelly --

166
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:16,553
and tell her, "I'm playing
a game to heal my brain,

167
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,200
and I want you to play with me."

168
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,046
This was an easier way to ask for help.

169
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,945
She became my first ally in the game,

170
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,905
my husband Kiyash joined next,

171
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:30,323
and together we identified
and battled the bad guys.

172
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:33,435
Now this was anything
that could trigger my symptoms

173
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,523
and therefore slow down
the healing process,

174
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,895
things like bright lights
and crowded spaces.

175
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,940
We also collected and activated power-ups.

176
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:43,901
This was anything I could do
on even my worst day

177
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:46,068
to feel just a little bit good,

178
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,996
just a little bit productive.

179
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,713
Things like cuddling
my dog for 10 minutes,

180
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:54,005
or getting out of bed and walking
around the block just once.

181
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,769
Now the game was that simple:

182
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:58,927
Adopt a secret identity,
recruit your allies,

183
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,500
battle the bad guys,
activate the power-ups.

184
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,935
But even with a game so simple,

185
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,498
within just a couple days
of starting to play,

186
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:10,329
that fog of depression
and anxiety went away.

187
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,789
It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.

188
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,301
Now it wasn't a miracle cure
for the headaches

189
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,564
or the cognitive symptoms.

190
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,305
That lasted for more than a year,

191
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,942
and it was the hardest year
of my life by far.

192
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,829
But even when I still had the symptoms,

193
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:27,510
even while I was still in pain,
I stopped suffering.

194
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:30,995
Now what happened next
with the game surprised me.

195
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,080
I put up some blog posts
and videos online,

196
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,525
explaining how to play.

197
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,080
But not everybody
has a concussion, obviously,

198
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:39,336
not everyone wants to be "the slayer,"

199
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,676
so I renamed the game SuperBetter.

200
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,266
And soon, I started hearing
from people all over the world

201
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,576
who were adopting
their own secret identity,

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,901
recruiting their own allies,
and they were getting "super better,"

203
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:54,807
facing challenges
like cancer and chronic pain,

204
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:57,140
depression and Crohn's disease.

205
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:01,521
Even people were playing it
for terminal diagnoses like ALS.

206
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:05,164
And I could tell from their messages
and their videos

207
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,751
that the game was helping them
in the same ways that it helped me.

208
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,627
They talked about feeling
stronger and braver.

209
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:16,312
They talked about feeling better
understood by their friends and family.

210
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,879
And they even talked
about feeling happier,

211
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,983
even though they were in pain,

212
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,374
even though they were tackling
the toughest challenge of their lives.

213
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:28,259
Now at the time, I'm thinking
to myself, what is going on here?

214
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:33,176
I mean, how could a game
so trivial intervene so powerfully

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,127
in such serious, and in some cases
life-and-death, circumstances?

216
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,922
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me,

217
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:41,453
there's no way I would have
believed it was possible.

218
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:43,896
Well, it turns out
there's some science here, too.

219
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:49,659
Some people get stronger and happier
after a traumatic event.

220
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,476
And that's what was happening to us.

221
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,621
The game was helping us experience

222
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,775
what scientists call
post-traumatic growth,

223
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,999
which is not something
we usually hear about.

224
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:01,888
We usually hear about
post-traumatic stress disorder.

225
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,504
But scientists now know
that a traumatic event

226
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,394
doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.

227
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,758
Instead, we can use it as a springboard

228
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:13,278
to unleash our best qualities
and lead happier lives.

229
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:17,944
Here are the top five things that people
with post-traumatic growth say:

230
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,492
"My priorities have changed."

231
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,826
"I'm not afraid to do
what makes me happy."

232
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,000
"I feel closer to my friends and family."

233
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,967
"I understand myself better.
I know who I really am now."

234
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:32,774
"I have a new sense of meaning
and purpose in my life."

235
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,250
"I'm better able to focus
on my goals and dreams."

236
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,369
Now, does this sound familiar?

237
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:42,625
It should, because the top five traits
of post-traumatic growth

238
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,139
are essentially the direct opposite
of the top five regrets of the dying.

239
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,703
Now this is interesting, right?

240
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,423
It seems that somehow, a traumatic event

241
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,587
can unlock our ability to lead
a life with fewer regrets.

242
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:57,907
But how does it work?

243
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,452
How do you get from trauma to growth?

244
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:03,227
Or better yet, is there a way
to get all the benefits

245
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,748
of post-traumatic growth
without the trauma,

246
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,201
without having to hit
your head in the first place?

247
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:09,708
That would be good, right?

248
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,107
I wanted to understand
the phenomenon better,

249
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,322
so I devoured the scientific literature,
and here's what I learned.

250
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,539
There are four kinds
of strength, or resilience,

251
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:21,679
that contribute to post-traumatic growth,

252
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:24,277
and there are scientifically
validated activities

253
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:28,741
that you can do every day to build up
these four kinds of resilience,

254
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,534
and you don't need a trauma to do it.

255
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:33,144
I could tell you what these four
types of strength are,

256
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:35,271
but I'd rather you
experience them firsthand.

257
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,244
I'd rather we all start building them up
together right now.

258
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,699
Here's what we're going to do.

259
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:41,500
We'll play a quick game together.

260
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:43,923
This is where you earn
the seven and a half minutes

261
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,947
of bonus life that I promised you earlier.

262
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,618
All you have to do
is successfully complete

263
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,959
the first four SuperBetter quests.

264
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:53,625
And I feel like you can do it.
I have confidence in you.

265
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,009
So, everybody ready?

266
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,296
This is your first quest. Here we go.

267
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,052
Pick one: Stand up and take three steps,

268
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:02,718
or make your hands into fists,
raise them over your head

269
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,671
as high as you can for five seconds, go!

270
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,509
All right, I like the people doing both.

271
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,138
You are overachievers. Very good.

272
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,231
(Laughter)

273
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,278
Well done, everyone.

274
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:14,438
That is worth +1 physical resilience,

275
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,184
which means that your body
can withstand more stress

276
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,723
and heal itself faster.

277
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:20,058
We know from the research

278
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:23,448
that the number one thing you can do
to boost your physical resilience

279
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,748
is to not sit still.

280
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:25,972
That's all it takes.

281
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:29,192
Every single second
that you are not sitting still,

282
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,984
you are actively improving
the health of your heart,

283
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:33,317
and your lungs and brains.

284
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,349
Everybody ready for your next quest?

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,293
I want you to snap
your fingers exactly 50 times,

286
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,820
or count backwards from 100
by seven, like this: 100, 93...

287
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:42,857
Go!

288
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:46,309
(Snapping)

289
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,396
Don't give up.

290
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,211
(Snapping)

291
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,267
Don't let the people
counting down from 100

292
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,997
interfere with your counting to 50.

293
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,909
(Snapping)

294
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,482
(Laughter)

295
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:02,210
Nice. Wow. That's the first
time I've ever seen that.

296
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:04,726
Bonus physical resilience.
Well done, everyone.

297
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,296
Now that's worth +1 mental resilience,

298
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,987
which means you have more
mental focus, more discipline,

299
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,837
determination and willpower.

300
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,649
We know from the scientific research

301
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,800
that willpower
actually works like a muscle.

302
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,575
It gets stronger the more you exercise it.

303
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,951
So tackling a tiny challenge
without giving up,

304
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:25,333
even one as absurd as snapping
your fingers exactly 50 times

305
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,215
or counting backwards from 100 by seven

306
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,811
is actually a scientifically validated way
to boost your willpower.

307
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,813
So good job. Quest number three.

308
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:36,101
Pick one: Because of the room,
fate's really determined this for you,

309
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,509
but here are the two options.

310
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,987
If you're inside,
find a window and look out of it.

311
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:42,539
If you're outside,
find a window and look in.

312
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,164
Or do a quick YouTube
or Google image search

313
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,960
for "baby [your favorite animal.]"

314
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,785
Do it on your phones,
or just shout out some baby animals,

315
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,361
and I'll put them on the screen.

316
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,841
So, what do we want to see?

317
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:58,318
Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake.
Okay, let's see what we got.

318
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:03,039
Baby dolphin and baby llamas.
Everybody look.

319
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:04,813
Got that?

320
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,068
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.

321
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,257
(Audience) Oh!

322
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:09,742
We're clapping for that?

323
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,950
That's amazing.

324
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:12,066
(Laughter)

325
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,589
All right, what we're just feeling there
is plus-one emotional resilience,

326
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,115
which means you have the ability
to provoke powerful,

327
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,597
positive emotions like curiosity or love,

328
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,473
which we feel looking at baby animals,

329
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:23,724
when you need them most.

330
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,402
Here's a secret from the scientific
literature for you.

331
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,127
If you can manage to experience
three positive emotions

332
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:32,652
for every one negative emotion

333
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,644
over the course of an hour, a day, a week,

334
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,740
you dramatically improve your health

335
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:41,324
and your ability to successfully tackle
any problem you're facing.

336
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,603
And this is called the three-to-one
positive emotion ratio.

337
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,285
It's my favorite
SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.

338
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,380
All right, pick one, last quest:

339
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:51,236
Shake someone's hand for six seconds,

340
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,967
or send someone a quick thank you

341
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,897
by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!

342
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:59,865
(Chatting)

343
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,584
Looking good, looking good.

344
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:04,511
Nice, nice.

345
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:06,448
Keep it up.

346
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,168
I love it!

347
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:11,584
All right, everybody,
that is +1 social resilience,

348
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:14,831
which means you actually get
more strength from your friends,

349
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:16,952
your neighbors, your family,
your community.

350
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,461
Now, a great way to boost
social resilience is gratitude.

351
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:21,752
Touch is even better.

352
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:23,303
Here's one more secret for you:

353
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,572
Shaking someone's hand for six seconds

354
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,608
dramatically raises the level
of oxytocin in your bloodstream,

355
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,474
now that's the trust hormone.

356
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,723
That means that all of you
who just shook hands

357
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:36,135
are biochemically primed to like
and want to help each other.

358
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,687
This will linger during the break,

359
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:41,097
so take advantage
of the networking opportunities.

360
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,167
(Laughter)

361
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:44,897
Well, you have successfully
completed your four quests,

362
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,324
let's see if I've successfully
completed my mission

363
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,733
to give you seven and a half
minutes of bonus life.

364
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:52,558
Now I get to share one more
little bit of science with you.

365
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:56,742
It turns out that people who regularly
boost these four types of resilience --

366
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,281
physical, mental, emotional and social --

367
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:01,738
live 10 years longer than everyone else.

368
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:02,824
So this is true.

369
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:06,631
If you are regularly achieving
the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,

370
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:09,782
if you are never sitting still
for more than an hour at a time,

371
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:13,651
if you are reaching out to one person
you care about every single day,

372
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:17,778
if you are tackling tiny goals
to boost your willpower,

373
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:20,129
you will live 10 years longer
than everyone else,

374
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,868
and here's where that math
I showed you earlier comes in.

375
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:26,891
So, the average life expectancy
in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,

376
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,019
but we know from more than 1,000
peer-reviewed scientific studies

377
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:33,638
that you can add 10 years of life
by boosting your four types of resilience.

378
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:37,197
So every single year that you are boosting
your four types of resilience,

379
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,470
you're actually earning
.128 more years of life

380
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:44,043
or 46 more days of life,
or 67,298 more minutes of life,

381
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:48,357
which means every single day,
you are earning 184 minutes of life,

382
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,858
or every single hour that you are boosting
your four types of resilience,

383
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:55,123
like we just did together,
you are earning 7.68245837

384
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,218
more minutes of life.

385
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,154
Congratulations, those seven
and a half minutes are all yours.

386
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,654
You totally earned them.

387
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:01,685
Yeah!

388
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,003
(Applause)

389
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:04,063
Awesome.

390
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,112
Wait, wait, wait.

391
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,600
You still have your special mission,
your secret mission.

392
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,664
How are you going to spend
these minutes of bonus life?

393
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:15,381
Well, here's my suggestion.

394
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:19,023
These seven and a half bonus minutes
are kind of like genie's wishes.

395
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:22,521
You can use your first wish
to wish for a million more wishes.

396
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,592
Pretty clever, right?

397
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:27,447
So, if you spend these
seven and a half minutes today

398
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,081
doing something that makes you happy,

399
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,824
or that gets you physically active,

400
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:34,927
or puts you in touch
with someone you care about,

401
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,760
or even just tackling a tiny challenge,

402
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,409
you're going to boost your resilience,
so you're going to earn more minutes.

403
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,888
And the good news is,
you can keep going like that.

404
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,192
Every hour of the day,
every day of your life,

405
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,624
all the way to your deathbed,

406
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:50,601
which will now be 10 years later
than it would have otherwise.

407
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:54,059
And when you get there, more than likely,

408
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,599
you will not have
any of those top five regrets,

409
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:00,472
because you will have built up
the strength and resilience

410
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:03,179
to lead a life truer to your dreams.

411
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,195
And with 10 extra years,
you might even have enough time

412
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,138
to play a few more games.

413
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,241
Thank you.

414
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,720
(Applause)
