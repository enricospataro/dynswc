00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:17,796
You know, when Chris first approached me
to speak at TED, I said no,

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,963
because I felt
like I wasn't going to be able

3
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:23,226
to make that personal connection,
you know, that I wanted to.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,796
It's such a large conference.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,319
But he explained to me
that he was in a bind,

6
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:30,796
and that he was having trouble
finding the kind of sex appeal

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,796
and star power that
the conference was known for.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,655
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,796
I'll come on two conditions.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,662
One: I want to speak as early
in the morning as possible.

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,436
And two: I want to pick
the theme for TED 2006.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,569
And luckily he agreed.

13
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:55,275
And the theme, in two years,
is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,796

Before my father death,

53
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:52,378
he had the sum of 23 million
United States dollars,

54
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:55,800
which he kept away from the rebel
leaders during the course of the war.

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,882

for the rehabilitation of water reserves
all over the country,

58
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,302
before the outbreak of war.

59
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,351
When the war broke out,

60
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,821
the rebel leader demanded
the fund be given to him,

61
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:13,148
my father insisted it
was not in his possession,

62
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:16,087
and he was killed because of his refusal
to release the fund.

63
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:17,718
Meanwhile, my mother and I

64

66
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,340
I made an arrangement
with a Red Cross relief worker,

67
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:28,937
who used his official van to transport
the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,

68

the real contents of the box.

in a safe, reliable security company
in Dakar, Senegal,

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,796
where I was only given temporary asylum.

73
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,796
I do not wish to invest
the money in Senegal

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,563
due to unfavorable economic climate,
and so close to my country.

00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:53,607
The only assistance I need from you,
which I know you would do for me,

76

are the following:
one, be a silent partner

and receive the funds
in your account in trust;

78
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,197
two, provide a bank account
under your control

00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,164

three, receive the funds
into your account in trust;

and leave the rest of the money

82

after the transfer is complete.

"What was I going to say next?"

(Laughter)

180
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,796
I'm obsessed with email.
I get a lot of it.

181
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,059
Four years later, I still get probably
two or three hundred emails a day

182
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,278
from people I don't know,

183
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,069
and it's been an amazing opportunity

184
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:03,031
to kind of get to know
different cultures, you know?

185
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,796
It's like a microscope
to the rest of the world.

186
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,785
You can kind of peer
into other people's lives.

187
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:15,298
And I also feel like I get a lot
of inspiration from the average user.

188
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:19,796
For example, somebody wrote,
"Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,

189
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,379
you should rock out with us,"
and I said, "Why wait?"

190
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:23,569
[rocking out]

191
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:26,559
(Video) (Music)

192
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,796
And they said,
"Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,

193
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,535
but I meant the kind of rocking out
where we'd be naked."

194
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,003
(Laughter)

195
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,471
And that was embarrassing.

196
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:39,925
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration
between me and the fans,

197
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,511
so I said, "Sure."

198
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:42,812
[rocking out naked]

199
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:43,863
(Video) (Music)

200
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:47,259
(Laughter)

201
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:48,796
I hear a lot of you whispering.

202
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,796
(Laughter)

203
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,735
And I know what you're saying,

204
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,990
"Holy crap!

205
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,796
How is his presentation so smooth?"

206
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,168
(Laughter)

207
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:02,015
And I have to say
that it's not all me this year.

208
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,796
I guess Chris has to take some credit
here, because in years past,

209
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,530
I guess there's been
some sort of subpar speakers at TED.

210
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,796
I don't know.

211
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,796
And so, this year, Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator.

212
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,227
(Laughter)

213
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:21,796
Which really allowed us as speakers
to get there, in the trenches,

214
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,796
and practice at home so that we would be
ready for this experience.

215
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,796
And I've got to say that, you know,
it's really, really great to be here.

216
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,665
(Pre-recorded applause)

217
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,785
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.

218
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,274
(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)

219
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,431
Not just the good stuff, though.

220
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,447
You can do heckler mode.

221
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,195
Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!

222
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,796
ZF: You get off the stage.

223
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,796
(Laughter)

224
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,015
Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.

225
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,790
(Laughter)

226
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:57,209
(Baby cooing)

227
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:02,706
(Huge crowd applauding)

228
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,304
In case you run over time.

229
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,478
(Heroic music)

230
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,896
Just one last thing
I'd like to say, I'd, really --

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,796
(Laughter)

232
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,163
I'd like to thank all of you
for being here.

233
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:13,350
(Loud music)

234
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,510
(Laughter)

235
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:16,938
And frog mode.

236
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,779
(Singing)

237
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,191
(Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made
love to a rock shrimp --"

238
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:35,662
(Laughter)

239
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:38,286
[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]

240
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:39,996
(Sighs)

241
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,292
It's true.

242
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,988
Some people say to me,

243
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:46,551
"Ze, you're doing all this stuff,
this Internet stuff,

244
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,206
and you're not making any money."

245
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,796
(Laughter)

246
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,148
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad --

247
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,796
(Laughter)

248
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,014
I'm trying."

249
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,796
I don't know if you're all aware of this,

250
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,796
but the video game market,

251
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,664
kids are playing these video games,

252
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,740
but, supposedly, there's tons of money.

253
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,987
I mean, like, I think,
100,000 dollars or so a year

254
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,606
is being spent on these things.

255
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,617
So I decided to try my hand.

256
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,424
I came up with a few games.

257
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,542
(Laughter)

258
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,796
This is called "Atheist."

259
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,463
I figured it would be popular
with the young kids.

260
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,184
Okay.

261
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,820
Look, I'll move around
and say some things.

262
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,380
(Sighs)

263
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:34,346
[Game over. There is no replay.]

264
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,148
(Laughter)

265
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,796
So that didn't go over so well.

266
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,153
(Laughter)

267
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,447
I don't really understand
why you're laughing.

268
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,796
(Laughter)

269
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,299
Should have done this
before I tried to pitch it.

270
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,796
"Buddhist," of course, looks
very, very similar to "Atheist."

271
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,905
(Laughter)

272
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,796
But you come back as a duck.

273
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,796
(Laughter)

274
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,249
And this is great because,
you know, for a quarter,

275
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:06,249
you can play this for a long time.

276
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:07,797
(Laughter)

277
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,598
And Chris had said in an email

278
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,969
that we should really bring
something new to TED,

279
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:14,445
something that we haven't shown anyone.

280
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,796
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."

281
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,274
It's the third in the series.

282
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,430
I'm hoping it's going
to do well this year.

283
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,161
(Sighs)

284
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,796
(Laughter)

285
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,074
Do you have a preference?

286
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,227
(Laughter)

287
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,401
Good choice.

288
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:34,467
(Laughter)

289
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:37,201
So you can wait for the Second Coming,

290
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:41,796
which is a random number
between one and 500 million.

291
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,746
(Laughter)

292
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,537
So really, what are we talking about here?

293
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,796
Oh, tech joy.

294
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,213
(Laughter)

295
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:55,939
Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.

296
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,796
And in fact, making things
using technology --

297
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,248
and I'm being serious here,

298
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:05,417
even though I'm using
my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.

299
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:09,532
Making things, you know --

300
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,862
making things actually
does give me a lot of joy.

301
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,201
It's the process of creation that keeps me

302
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:17,796
sort of a bubble and a half
above perpetual anxiety in my life,

303
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,249
and it's that feeling of being
about 80 percent complete on a project --

304
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:23,464
where you know you still have
something to do,

305
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,796
but it's not finished,
and you're not starting something --

306
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,510
that really fills my entire life.

307
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,368
And so, what I've done is,

308
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,998
I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces

309
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,492
to share that feeling

310
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:38,920
with people who don't consider
themselves artists.

311
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,418
We're in a culture of guru-ship.

312
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:45,274
It's so hard to use some software
because, you know, it's unapproachable,

313
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,874
people feel like they have
to read the manual.

314
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:53,490
So I try to create
these very minimal activities

315
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:56,944
that allow people to express
themselves, and, hopefully --

316
00:14:56,968 --> 00:15:00,796
("The End" by The Doors)

317
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,796
Whoa! I'm like -- on the page,
but it doesn't exist.

318
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,182
(Laughter)

319
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:11,194
It's, like -- seriously, though --

320
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,796
(Laughter)

321
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,796
I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves.

322
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,883
(Laughter)

323
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:22,796
Here I created a contest called,
"When Office Supplies Attack,"

324
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,796
which, I think, really resonated
with the working population.

325
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,978
(Laughter)

326
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:32,463
Over 500 entries in three weeks.

327
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,796
Toilet paper fashion.

328
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,663
(Laughter)

329
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,974
Again, people from all over the country.

330
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:42,106
The watch is particularly incredible.

331
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,796
(Laughter)

332
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,604
Online drawing tools --
you've probably seen a lot of them.

333
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:48,875
I think they're wonderful.

334
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,371
It's a chance for people
to get to play with crayons

335
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,681
and all that kind of stuff.

336
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,058
But I'm interested
in the process of creating,

337
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:58,260
as the real event that I'm interested in.

338
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:02,418
And the problem is that
a lot of people suck at drawing,

339
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:06,408
and they get bummed out at this,
sort of, you know, stick figure,

340
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,635
awful little thing that they created.

341
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:11,796
And eventually, it just makes them
stop playing with it,

342
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,341
or they draw penises and things like that.

343
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:15,796
(Laughter)

344
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,225
So, the Scribbler is an attempt
to create a generative tool.

345
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,796
In other words, it's a helping tool.

346
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,630
You can draw your simple stick figure,

347
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:27,796
and it collaborates with you to create
sort of a post-war German etching.

348
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,026
(Laughter)

349
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,875
In fact, it's tuned to be better
at drawing things that look worse.

350
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,764
So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.

351
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,796
So the idea is that you can really,

352
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,796
you know, partake in this process,

353
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,796
but watch something
really crappy look beautiful.

354
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,383
And here are some of my favorites.

355
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:58,265
This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me.

356
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,368
Very cool.

357
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:03,513
(Laughter)

358
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,306
Darling.

359
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,310
Beautiful stuff.

360
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,211
I mean this is incredible.

361
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:13,936
An 11-year-old girl drew this
and submitted it.

362
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,667
It's just gorgeous.

363
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,215
(Laughter)

364
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,007
I'm dead serious here.

365
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,478
This is not a joke.

366
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,796
(Laughter)

367
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,115
But, I think it's a really fun
and wonderful thing.

368
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,301
So this is called the "Fiction Project."

369
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,298
This is an online space,

370
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,796
which is basically
a refurbished message board

371
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,550
that encourages collaborative
fiction writing.

372
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:38,796
These are haikus.

373
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,201
None of the haikus were written
by the same person.

374
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:45,181
In fact, each line is contributed
by a different person

375
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:46,796
at a different time.

376
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,662
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,

377
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,466
mistress cruel approaches me,
now tied down, it's up."

378
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,796
It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,

379
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,248
if you come home, and your spouse,
or whoever it is,

380
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:05,018
says, "Let's talk" --

381
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:10,365
That, like, chills you to the very core.

382
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,444
(Laughter)

383
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,643
But it's peripheral activities like these

384
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,796
that allow people to get together,
doing fun things.

385
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,582
They actually get to know each other,

386
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:22,176
and it's sort of like low-threshold
peripheral activities

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,166
that I think are the key to bringing up

388
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,714
some of our bonding social capital
that we're lacking.

389
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,102
And very, very quickly --
I love puppets.

390
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,111
Here's a puppet.

391
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,319
It dances to music.

392
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:36,796
Lotte Reiniger, an amazing
shadow puppeteer in the 20s,

393
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,789
that started doing more elaborate things.

394
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,290
I became interested in puppets,

395
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,503
and I just want to show
one last thing to you.

396
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,099
Oh, this is how you make puppets.

397
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,709
(Applause)

398
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,249
Chris Anderson: Ladies
and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

399
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:51,273
(Applause)
