1
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,789
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,

2
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,487
which has an equally disturbing answer.

3
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:23,089
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,

4
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,423
and the question I'm going to tackle

5
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:29,504
is the one question everyone always asks:

6
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:31,116
Why does she stay?

7
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:35,112
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?

8
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:38,089
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker

9
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,424
or an expert in domestic violence.

10
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:43,623
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.

11
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:48,136
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.

12
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:50,608
I had moved to New York City for my first job

13
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,904
as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.

14
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,144
I had my first apartment,

15
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:59,344
my first little green American Express card,

16
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,372
and I had a very big secret.

17
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:06,071
My secret was that I had this gun

18
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:09,509
loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head

19
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,072
by the man who I thought was my soulmate,

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,557
many, many times.

21
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:19,117
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth

22
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:23,196
held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me

23
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:26,381
more times than I can even remember.

24
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:29,124
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,

25
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:32,308
a psychological trap disguised as love,

26
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:35,160
one that millions of women and even a few men

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,541
fall into every year.

28
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,290
It may even be your story.

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,333
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.

30
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,639
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,

31
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,001
an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.

32
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,293
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies

33
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:55,565
including Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.

34
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:59,361
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:02,150
and we have three kids together.

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,379
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.

37
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,859
(Laughter)

38
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,578
So my first message for you is that domestic violence

39
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,946
happens to everyone --

40
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:18,122
all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

41
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:20,061
It's everywhere.

42
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,581
And my second message is that everyone thinks

43
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,699
domestic violence happens to women,

44
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,967
that it's a women's issue.

45
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,186
Not exactly.

46
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:33,298
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse

47
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:39,216
happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,

48
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:41,385
in other words, in families,

49
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:45,250
the last place we would want or expect to find violence,

50
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,528
which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.

51
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:53,079
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth

52
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,651
who would stay with a man who beats me,

53
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:59,058
but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.

54
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,343
I was 22, and in the United States,

55
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:06,192
women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely

56
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,953
to be domestic violence victims

57
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:11,768
as women of other ages,

58
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:15,071
and over 500 women and girls this age

59
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:18,642
are killed every year by abusive partners,

60
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:23,275
boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.

61
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,335
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing

62
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:30,920
about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,985
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.

64
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:38,948
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,

65
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:41,087
and he started chatting me up.

66
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,955
He told me two things.

67
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:46,757
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,

68
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:51,112
and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.

69
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:54,772
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting

70
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:58,060
was that he was smart and funny

71
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,460
and he looked like a farm boy.

72
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,807
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks

73
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,492
and this wheat-blond hair,

74
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,779
and he seemed so sweet.

75
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,563
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,

76
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:16,137
was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.

77
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,338
He did this especially at the beginning

78
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:21,204
by idolizing me.

79
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:24,490
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,

80
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,174
that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,

81
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:29,204
that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.

82
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,735
He wanted to know everything about my family

83
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,351
and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.

84
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:37,985
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,

85
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,664
in a way that no one else ever had.

86
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:45,989
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us

87
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,509
by confessing his secret,

88
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,989
which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,

89
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,900
he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused

90
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,586
by his stepfather,

91
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:01,526
and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,

92
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:04,145
even though he was very smart,

93
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:07,401
and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.

94
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:10,557
Which is why that Ivy League degree

95
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:13,370
and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future

96
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,941
meant so much to him.

97
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,085
If you had told me

98
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:23,449
that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me

99
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,832
would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,

100
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:29,882
how short my skirts were,

101
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,812
where I lived, what jobs I took,

102
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:35,176
who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,

103
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,124
I would have laughed at you,

104
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:40,172
because there was not a hint of violence or control

105
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,656
or anger in Conor at the beginning.

106
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,781
I didn't know that the first stage

107
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,156
in any domestic violence relationship

108
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:52,808
is to seduce and charm the victim.

109
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:57,568
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.

110
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:01,722
Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,

111
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,856
"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,

112
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:06,861
but I need to move into the next phase

113
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:11,040
where I isolate you and I abuse you" — (Laughter) —

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,395
"so I need to get you out of this apartment

115
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,036
where the neighbors can hear you scream

116
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,509
and out of this city where you have friends and family

117
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,815
and coworkers who can see the bruises."

118
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:24,036
Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening

119
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,767
and he told me that he had quit his job that day,

120
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,232
his dream job,

121
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:33,373
and he said that he had quit his job because of me,

122
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,551
because I had made him feel so safe and loved

123
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,674
that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,

124
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:42,189
and he just wanted to get out of the city

125
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,167
and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,

126
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,289
and move to a tiny town in New England

127
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,862
where he could start his life over with me by his side.

128
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:55,728
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,

129
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:59,335
and my dream job,

130
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,918
but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,

131
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,382
so I agreed, and I quit my job,

132
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,013
and Conor and I left Manhattan together.

133
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:12,379
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,

134
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,011
that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid

135
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:20,991
physical, financial and psychological trap.

136
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,311
The next step in the domestic violence pattern

137
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:27,593
is to introduce the threat of violence

138
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,792
and see how she reacts.

139
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,501
And here's where those guns come in.

140
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:35,419
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,

141
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,157
that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --

142
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,573
he bought three guns.

143
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,013
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.

144
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,669
He kept one under the pillows on our bed,

145
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,831
and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.

146
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:52,149
And he said that he needed those guns

147
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:54,945
because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.

148
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:57,429
He needed them to feel protected.

149
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,341
But those guns were really a message for me,

150
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,035
and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,

151
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:08,841
my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.

152
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,414
Conor first physically attacked me

153
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:15,239
five days before our wedding.

154
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:19,431
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.

155
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,671
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,

156
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,485
and I got frustrated,

157
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:28,572
and Conor used my anger as an excuse

158
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:31,723
to put both of his hands around my neck

159
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:35,543
and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,

160
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,367
and he used the chokehold

161
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,793
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.

162
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:47,111
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,

163
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,586
and I put on my mother's wedding dress,

164
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:51,903
and I married him.

165
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:54,184
Despite what had happened,

166
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:57,703
I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,

167
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,784
because I loved him, and he loved me so much.

168
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:05,156
And he was very, very sorry.

169
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:08,329
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding

170
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,526
and by becoming a family with me.

171
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,247
It was an isolated incident,

172
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,843
and he was never going to hurt me again.

173
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,423
It happened twice more on the honeymoon.

174
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,510
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach

175
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,212
and I got lost,

176
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,182
and he punched me in the side of my head so hard

177
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,326
that the other side of my head repeatedly hit

178
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,733
the driver's side window.

179
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:35,099
And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,

180
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,382
he got frustrated by traffic,

181
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:40,814
and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.

182
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,422
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week

183
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:46,839
for the next two and a half years of our marriage.

184
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,964
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique

185
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,607
and alone in this situation.

186
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,798
One in three American women

187
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:58,950
experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,

188
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,591
and the CDC reports that 15 million children

189
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:06,001
are abused every year, 15 million.

190
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:10,374
So actually, I was in very good company.

191
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:12,790
Back to my question:

192
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,285
Why did I stay?

193
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:18,023
The answer is easy.

194
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:20,711
I didn't know he was abusing me.

195
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:24,559
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,

196
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,782
pushed me down stairs,

197
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,163
threatened to kill our dog,

198
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:32,086
pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,

199
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:34,603
poured coffee grinds on my head

200
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,919
as I dressed for a job interview,

201
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,289
I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.

202
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:44,866
Instead, I was a very strong woman

203
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:47,118
in love with a deeply troubled man,

204
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,175
and I was the only person on Earth

205
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:52,615
who could help Conor face his demons.

206
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:56,326
The other question everybody asks is,

207
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,743
why doesn't she just leave?

208
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:02,694
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.

209
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:07,406
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,

210
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,497
because we victims know something you usually don't:

211
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:14,890
It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.

212
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,209
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern

213
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,104
is kill her.

214
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:23,645
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders

215
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,713
happen after the victim has ended the relationship,

216
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:29,606
after she's gotten out,

217
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,857
because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.

218
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,948
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,

219
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,900
even after the abuser remarries;

220
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,055
denial of financial resources;

221
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,444
and manipulation of the family court system

222
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:46,267
to terrify the victim and her children,

223
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:51,193
who are regularly forced by family court judges

224
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,162
to spend unsupervised time

225
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:56,833
with the man who beat their mother.

226
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:01,008
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?

227
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:02,762
I was able to leave,

228
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,664
because of one final, sadistic beating

229
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:08,823
that broke through my denial.

230
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,993
I realized that the man who I loved so much

231
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:14,903
was going to kill me if I let him.

232
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:17,418
So I broke the silence.

233
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:20,248
I told everyone:

234
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:24,033
the police, my neighbors,

235
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,873
my friends and family, total strangers,

236
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:34,727
and I'm here today because you all helped me.

237
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,265
We tend to stereotype victims

238
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,327
as grisly headlines,

239
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,623
self-destructive women, damaged goods.

240
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:46,626
The question, "Why does she stay?"

241
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:52,262
is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"

242
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,586
as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men

243
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,218
intent upon destroying us.

244
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,722
But since publishing "Crazy Love,"

245
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:04,245
I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women

246
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,690
who also got out,

247
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,070
who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,

248
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,283
and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --

249
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,617
as employees, wives and mothers,

250
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:22,298
lives completely free of violence, like me.

251
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:26,329
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim

252
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,773
and a typical domestic violence survivor.

253
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:33,798
I remarried a kind and gentle man,

254
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,134
and we have those three kids.

255
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:39,535
I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.

256
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:43,001
What I will never have again,

257
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:45,959
ever,

258
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,084
is a loaded gun held to my head

259
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:51,727
by someone who says that he loves me.

260
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,358
Right now, maybe you're thinking,

261
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,265
"Wow, this is fascinating,"

262
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:59,393
or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"

263
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:05,396
but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.

264
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:08,913
I promise you there are several people

265
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,655
listening to me right now

266
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,667
who are currently being abused

267
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,182
or who were abused as children

268
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:19,552
or who are abusers themselves.

269
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:21,489
Abuse could be affecting your daughter,

270
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:26,782
your sister, your best friend right now.

271
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,226
I was able to end my own crazy love story

272
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:32,427
by breaking the silence.

273
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:34,942
I'm still breaking the silence today.

274
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:38,758
It's my way of helping other victims,

275
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:42,126
and it's my final request of you.

276
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,958
Talk about what you heard here.

277
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,286
Abuse thrives only in silence.

278
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:51,989
You have the power to end domestic violence

279
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,498
simply by shining a spotlight on it.

280
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:58,572
We victims need everyone.

281
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:02,645
We need every one of you to understand

282
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:06,423
the secrets of domestic violence.

283
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:09,407
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it

284
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,534
with your children, your coworkers,

285
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,471
your friends and family.

286
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:16,917
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people

287
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,732
with full futures.

288
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:23,213
Recognize the early signs of violence

289
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,046
and conscientiously intervene,

290
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:30,208
deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.

291
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,203
Together we can make our beds,

292
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:37,820
our dinner tables and our families

293
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,077
the safe and peaceful oases they should be.

294
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:43,049
Thank you.

295
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:50,757
(Applause)
