1
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,415
I want to talk about social innovation

2
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,366
and social entrepreneurship.

3
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,986
I happen to have triplets.

4
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,559
They're little. They're five years old.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,226
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets.
They say, "Really? How many?"

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,615
(Laughter)

7
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:33,740
Here's a picture of the kids --
that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.

8
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,318
Now, I also happen to be gay.

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,378
Being gay and fathering triplets is by far

10
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:45,244
the most socially innovative,
socially entrepreneurial thing

11
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:46,816
I have ever done.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,895
(Laughter)

13
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:51,567
(Applause)

14
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:55,972
The real social innovation I want
to talk about involves charity.

15
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:59,366
I want to talk about how the things
we've been taught to think

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,624
about giving and about charity

17
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:03,529
and about the nonprofit sector,

18
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:07,498
are actually undermining
the causes we love,

19
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:10,302
and our profound yearning
to change the world.

20
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:13,888
But before I do that,
I want to ask if we even believe

21
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:16,866
that the nonprofit sector
has any serious role to play

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,082
in changing the world.

23
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,716
A lot of people say now that business
will lift up the developing economies,

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,065
and social business
will take care of the rest.

25
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,307
And I do believe that business will move
the great mass of humanity forward.

26
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:35,473
But it always leaves behind
that 10 percent or more

27
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:38,258
that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,310
And social business needs markets,

29
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,096
and there are some issues
for which you just can't develop

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,930
the kind of money measures
that you need for a market.

31
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:50,508
I sit on the board of a center
for the developmentally disabled,

32
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:52,842
and these people want laughter

33
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:55,005
and compassion and they want love.

34
00:01:57,278 --> 00:01:58,759
How do you monetize that?

35
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,223
And that's where the nonprofit sector
and philanthropy come in.

36
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:08,060
Philanthropy is the market for love.

37
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,812
It is the market for all those people

38
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,235
for whom there is no other market coming.

39
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,383
And so if we really want,
like Buckminster Fuller said,

40
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,772
a world that works for everyone,

41
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,276
with no one and nothing left out,

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,438
then the nonprofit sector has to be

43
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,570
a serious part of the conversation.

44
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,318
But it doesn't seem to be working.

45
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:31,398
Why have our breast cancer
charities not come close

46
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:33,144
to finding a cure for breast cancer,

47
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,120
or our homeless charities not come close

48
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:37,434
to ending homelessness in any major city?

49
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,205
Why has poverty remained stuck

50
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,280
at 12 percent of the U.S.
population for 40 years?

51
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,441
And the answer is,

52
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,720
these social problems
are massive in scale,

53
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,498
our organizations
are tiny up against them,

54
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,354
and we have a belief system
that keeps them tiny.

55
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,437
We have two rulebooks.

56
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,327
We have one for the nonprofit sector,

57
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,870
and one for the rest
of the economic world.

58
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,810
It's an apartheid, and it discriminates

59
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,760
against the nonprofit sector
in five different areas,

60
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,543
the first being compensation.

61
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,438
So in the for-profit sector,
the more value you produce,

62
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,000
the more money you can make.

63
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,108
But we don't like nonprofits to use money

64
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,481
to incentivize people
to produce more in social service.

65
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,571
We have a visceral reaction
to the idea that anyone

66
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,266
would make very much money
helping other people.

67
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:30,281
Interestingly, we don't have
a visceral reaction

68
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,710
to the notion that people
would make a lot of money

69
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,959
not helping other people.

70
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,084
You know, you want to make
50 million dollars

71
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,330
selling violent video games
to kids, go for it.

72
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,475
We'll put you on the cover
of Wired magazine.

73
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,523
But you want to make
half a million dollars

74
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,036
trying to cure kids of malaria,

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,180
and you're considered a parasite yourself.

76
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:52,132
(Applause)

77
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,577
And we think of this
as our system of ethics,

78
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,744
but what we don't realize
is that this system

79
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,926
has a powerful side effect, which is:

80
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,704
It gives a really stark,
mutually exclusive choice

81
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:07,362
between doing very well
for yourself and your family

82
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:09,780
or doing good for the world,

83
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:12,598
to the brightest minds
coming out of our best universities,

84
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:14,732
and sends tens of thousands of people

85
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,454
who could make a huge difference
in the nonprofit sector,

86
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,074
marching every year
directly into the for-profit sector

87
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:24,034
because they're not willing to make
that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.

88
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,169
Businessweek did a survey,
looked at the compensation packages

89
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:30,518
for MBAs 10 years out of business school.

90
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,960
And the median compensation
for a Stanford MBA,

91
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:38,205
with bonus, at the age of 38,
was 400,000 dollars.

92
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,062
Meanwhile, for the same year,
the average salary

93
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:43,915
for the CEO of a $5 million-plus
medical charity in the U.S.

94
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,934
was 232,000 dollars,
and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.

95
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:52,181
Now, there's no way you're
going to get a lot of people

96
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:56,260
with $400,000 talent to make
a $316,000 sacrifice every year

97
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:58,507
to become the CEO of a hunger charity.

98
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:03,112
Some people say, "Well, that's just
because those MBA types are greedy."

99
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,307
Not necessarily. They might be smart.

100
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:07,838
It's cheaper for that person to donate

101
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:11,672
100,000 dollars every year
to the hunger charity;

102
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,610
save 50,000 dollars on their taxes --

103
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:18,059
so still be roughly 270,000 dollars
a year ahead of the game --

104
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,678
now be called a philanthropist
because they donated

105
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,536
100,000 dollars to charity;

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,818
probably sit on the board
of the hunger charity;

107
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:26,738
indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB

108
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:29,508
who decided to become the CEO
of the hunger charity;

109
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,539
(Laughter)

110
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,914
and have a lifetime
of this kind of power and influence

111
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:36,198
and popular praise still ahead of them.

112
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,124
The second area of discrimination
is advertising and marketing.

113
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,629
So we tell the for-profit sector,
"Spend, spend, spend on advertising,

114
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,975
until the last dollar no longer
produces a penny of value."

115
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,865
But we don't like to see our donations
spent on advertising in charity.

116
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,864
Our attitude is, "Well, look,
if you can get the advertising donated,

117
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,133
you know, to air at four o'clock
in the morning, I'm okay with that.

118
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:01,521
But I don't want my donation
spent on advertising,

119
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,112
I want it go to the needy."

120
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,994
As if the money invested in advertising

121
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:07,648
could not bring in dramatically
greater sums of money

122
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:08,824
to serve the needy.

123
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,764
In the 1990s, my company created

124
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,163
the long-distance
AIDSRide bicycle journeys,

125
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:19,736
and the 60 mile-long
breast cancer three-day walks,

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,720
and over the course of nine years,

127
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:27,783
we had 182,000 ordinary
heroes participate,

128
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:31,703
and they raised a total
of 581 million dollars.

129
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:34,867
(Applause)

130
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,344
They raised more money
more quickly for these causes

131
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:39,034
than any events in history,

132
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:41,852
all based on the idea
that people are weary

133
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,678
of being asked to do the least
they can possibly do.

134
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:49,268
People are yearning to measure
the full distance of their potential

135
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,927
on behalf of the causes
that they care about deeply.

136
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,268
But they have to be asked.

137
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,490
We got that many people to participate

138
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,725
by buying full-page ads
in The New York Times,

139
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,162
in The Boston Globe, in prime time
radio and TV advertising.

140
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,345
Do you know how many people
we would've gotten

141
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,249
if we put up fliers in the laundromat?

142
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:13,040
Charitable giving has remained stuck
in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,

143
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,823
ever since we started
measuring it in the 1970s.

144
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,160
That's an important fact,
because it tells us

145
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,874
that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector

146
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,979
has not been able
to wrestle any market share

147
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,038
away from the for-profit sector.

148
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,954
And if you think about it,
how could one sector

149
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:32,035
possibly take market share
away from another sector

150
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,230
if it isn't really allowed to market?

151
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,975
And if we tell the consumer brands,

152
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,555
"You may advertise
all the benefits of your product,"

153
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,960
but we tell charities, "You cannot
advertise all the good that you do,"

154
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,745
where do we think the consumer
dollars are going to flow?

155
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,809
The third area of discrimination
is the taking of risk

156
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,040
in pursuit of new ideas
for generating revenue.

157
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:57,595
So Disney can make a new
$200 million movie that flops,

158
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,707
and nobody calls the attorney general.

159
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:04,455
But you do a little $1 million
community fundraiser for the poor,

160
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,372
and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit
to the cause in the first 12 months,

161
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,534
and your character
is called into question.

162
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:14,652
So nonprofits are really reluctant
to attempt any brave,

163
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,603
daring, giant-scale
new fundraising endeavors,

164
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,228
for fear that if the thing fails,

165
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,624
their reputations will be dragged
through the mud.

166
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:22,807
Well, you and I know

167
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,228
when you prohibit failure,
you kill innovation.

168
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,893
If you kill innovation in fundraising,
you can't raise more revenue;

169
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,198
if you can't raise more revenue,
you can't grow;

170
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:34,634
and if you can't grow, you can't
possibly solve large social problems.

171
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,301
The fourth area is time.

172
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,719
So Amazon went for six years
without returning any profit to investors,

173
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:43,221
and people had patience.

174
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:46,483
They knew that there was a long-term
objective down the line,

175
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:48,093
of building market dominance.

176
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:50,700
But if a nonprofit organization
ever had a dream

177
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:54,974
of building magnificent scale
that required that for six years,

178
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:56,862
no money was going to go to the needy,

179
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,522
it was all going to be invested
in building this scale,

180
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,046
we would expect a crucifixion.

181
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:03,990
The last area is profit itself.

182
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,530
So the for-profit sector
can pay people profits

183
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,127
in order to attract their capital
for their new ideas,

184
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:12,267
but you can't pay profits
in a nonprofit sector,

185
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,263
so the for-profit sector has a lock

186
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,768
on the multi-trillion-dollar
capital markets,

187
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:21,450
and the nonprofit sector is starved
for growth and risk and idea capital.

188
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:24,600
Well, you put those
five things together --

189
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:27,778
you can't use money to lure talent
away from the for-profit sector;

190
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,993
you can't advertise
on anywhere near the scale

191
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,371
the for-profit sector
does for new customers;

192
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,359
you can't take the kinds of risks
in pursuit of those customers

193
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:37,071
that the for-profit sector takes;

194
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:40,728
you don't have the same amount of time
to find them as the for-profit sector;

195
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:43,816
and you don't have a stock market
with which to fund any of this,

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,952
even if you could do it
in the first place --

197
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,896
and you've just put the nonprofit sector

198
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,580
at an extreme disadvantage
to the for-profit sector,

199
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:51,770
on every level.

200
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,047
If we have any doubts about the effects
of this separate rule book,

201
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,595
this statistic is sobering:

202
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,959
From 1970 to 2009,

203
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,714
the number of nonprofits that really grew,

204
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,918
that crossed the $50 million
annual revenue barrier,

205
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,576
is 144.

206
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,904
In the same time, the number
of for-profits that crossed it

207
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,067
is 46,136.

208
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:18,059
So we're dealing with social problems
that are massive in scale,

209
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,409
and our organizations
can't generate any scale.

210
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,234
All of the scale goes
to Coca-Cola and Burger King.

211
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,686
So why do we think this way?

212
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,812
Well, like most fanatical
dogma in America,

213
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,721
these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.

214
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,372
The Puritans came here
for religious reasons, or so they said,

215
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,594
but they also came here because
they wanted to make a lot of money.

216
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,332
They were pious people,

217
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,371
but they were also
really aggressive capitalists,

218
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,915
and they were accused of extreme forms
of profit-making tendencies,

219
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:51,852
compared to the other colonists.

220
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:55,340
But at the same time,
the Puritans were Calvinists,

221
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,887
so they were taught literally
to hate themselves.

222
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:00,955
They were taught
that self-interest was a raging sea

223
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,566
that was a sure path to eternal damnation.

224
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,518
This created a real problem
for these people.

225
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:10,059
Here they've come all the way across
the Atlantic to make all this money,

226
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,258
but making all this money
will get you sent directly to Hell.

227
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:14,840
What were they to do about this?

228
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,792
Well, charity became their answer.

229
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,247
It became this economic sanctuary,

230
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:22,890
where they could do penance
for their profit-making tendencies --

231
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,914
at five cents on the dollar.

232
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,233
So of course, how could you
make money in charity

233
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,581
if charity was your penance
for making money?

234
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:34,859
Financial incentive was exiled
from the realm of helping others,

235
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:38,288
so that it could thrive in the area
of making money for yourself,

236
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:41,479
and in 400 years, nothing has intervened

237
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:44,737
to say, "That's counterproductive
and that's unfair."

238
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:50,600
Now, this ideology gets policed
by this one very dangerous question,

239
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:54,904
which is, "What percentage of my donation
goes to the cause versus overhead?"

240
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,420
There are a lot of problems
with this question.

241
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:58,944
I'm going to just focus on two.

242
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,033
First, it makes us think
that overhead is a negative,

243
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,850
that it is somehow not part of the cause.

244
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:10,677
But it absolutely is, especially
if it's being used for growth.

245
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,732
Now, this idea that overhead
is somehow an enemy of the cause

246
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:18,257
creates this second, much larger problem,

247
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:22,117
which is, it forces organizations
to go without the overhead things

248
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,749
they really need to grow,

249
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,045
in the interest of keeping overhead low.

250
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:29,252
So we've all been taught
that charities should spend

251
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:32,051
as little as possible on overhead
things like fundraising

252
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:35,449
under the theory that, well, the less
money you spend on fundraising,

253
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,274
the more money there is
available for the cause.

254
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,498
Well, that's true
if it's a depressing world

255
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:44,225
in which this pie cannot
be made any bigger.

256
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,305
But if it's a logical world
in which investment in fundraising

257
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,815
actually raises more funds
and makes the pie bigger,

258
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,696
then we have it precisely backwards,

259
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,268
and we should be investing more money,
not less, in fundraising,

260
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,021
because fundraising is the one thing

261
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,656
that has the potential
to multiply the amount of money

262
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,497
available for the cause
that we care about so deeply.

263
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll give you two examples.

264
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:08,870
We launched the AIDSRides

265
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:11,966
with an initial investment
of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.

266
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:17,405
Within nine years,
we had multiplied that 1,982 times,

267
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,619
into 108 million dollars
after all expenses, for AIDS services.

268
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:24,951
We launched the breast cancer three-days

269
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:28,438
with an initial investment
of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.

270
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:33,533
Within just five years,
we had multiplied that 554 times,

271
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:37,136
into 194 million dollars
after all expenses,

272
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,481
for breast cancer research.

273
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,104
Now, if you were a philanthropist
really interested in breast cancer,

274
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,421
what would make more sense:

275
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:47,296
go out and find the most innovative
researcher in the world

276
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,700
and give her 350,000 dollars for research,

277
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:54,343
or give her fundraising
department the 350,000 dollars

278
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,652
to multiply it into 194 million dollars
for breast cancer research?

279
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,645
2002 was our most successful year ever.

280
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:05,803
We netted for breast cancer
alone, that year alone,

281
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,914
71 million dollars after all expenses.

282
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,993
And then we went out of business,

283
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,835
suddenly and traumatically.

284
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,843
Why? Well, the short story is,
our sponsors split on us.

285
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:21,930
They wanted to distance themselves from us

286
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,811
because we were being
crucified in the media

287
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:28,213
for investing 40 percent
of the gross in recruitment

288
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:31,601
and customer service
and the magic of the experience,

289
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,488
and there is no accounting
terminology to describe

290
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,662
that kind of investment
in growth and in the future,

291
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,630
other than this demonic
label of "overhead."

292
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:47,972
So on one day, all 350
of our great employees

293
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:49,622
lost their jobs ...

294
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,305
because they were labeled "overhead."

295
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:58,178
Our sponsor went and tried
the events on their own.

296
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:59,535
The overhead went up.

297
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,328
Net income for breast cancer research
went down by 84 percent,

298
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:06,270
or 60 million dollars, in one year.

299
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:13,201
This is what happens when we confuse
morality with frugality.

300
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,345
We've all been taught that the bake sale
with five percent overhead

301
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,320
is morally superior to the professional
fundraising enterprise

302
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,010
with 40 percent overhead,

303
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,311
but we're missing the most important
piece of information, which is:

304
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,811
What is the actual size of these pies?

305
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:33,413
Who cares if the bake sale only has
five percent overhead if it's tiny?

306
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,965
What if the bake sale
only netted 71 dollars for charity

307
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,013
because it made no investment in its scale

308
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:41,418
and the professional
fundraising enterprise netted

309
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,748
71 million dollars because it did?

310
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,986
Now which pie would we prefer,

311
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,105
and which pie do we think people
who are hungry would prefer?

312
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:53,083
Here's how all of this
impacts the big picture.

313
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,288
I said that charitable giving is
two percent of GDP in the United States.

314
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:00,002
That's about 300 billion dollars a year.

315
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,389
But only about 20 percent of that,
or 60 billion dollars,

316
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,366
goes to health and human services causes.

317
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,016
The rest goes to religion
and higher education and hospitals,

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,938
and that 60 billion dollars
is not nearly enough

319
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,517
to tackle these problems.

320
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,519
But if we could move charitable giving
from two percent of GDP,

321
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:25,181
up just one step to three percent of GDP,
by investing in that growth,

322
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:29,240
that would be an extra 150 billion dollars
a year in contributions,

323
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,622
and if that money
could go disproportionately

324
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,505
to health and human services charities,

325
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,768
because those were the ones we encouraged
to invest in their growth,

326
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,550
that would represent a tripling
of contributions to that sector.

327
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,741
Now we're talking scale.

328
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:45,249
Now we're talking the potential
for real change.

329
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:49,486
But it's never going to happen
by forcing these organizations

330
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,338
to lower their horizons

331
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:54,981
to the demoralizing objective
of keeping their overhead low.

332
00:16:56,957 --> 00:17:00,289
Our generation does not want
its epitaph to read,

333
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:02,440
"We kept charity overhead low."

334
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:06,988
(Laughter)

335
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:10,844
(Applause)

336
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,075
We want it to read
that we changed the world,

337
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,814
and that part of the way we did that

338
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:17,427
was by changing the way
we think about these things.

339
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,253
So the next time
you're looking at a charity,

340
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,358
don't ask about the rate
of their overhead.

341
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,697
Ask about the scale of their dreams,

342
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:28,277
their Apple-, Google-,
Amazon-scale dreams,

343
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,770
how they measure their progress
toward those dreams,

344
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,429
and what resources they need
to make them come true,

345
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,216
regardless of what the overhead is.

346
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,844
Who cares what the overhead is

347
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:39,203
if these problems
are actually getting solved?

348
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:43,163
If we can have that kind of generosity --

349
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,315
a generosity of thought --

350
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,215
then the non-profit sector
can play a massive role

351
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:51,671
in changing the world
for all those citizens

352
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,288
most desperately in need of it to change.

353
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,766
And if that can be
our generation's enduring legacy --

354
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,354
that we took responsibility

355
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,873
for the thinking that had
been handed down to us,

356
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,713
that we revisited it, we revised it,

357
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:14,819
and we reinvented the whole way
humanity thinks about changing things,

358
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,319
forever, for everyone --

359
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:22,137
well, I thought I would let
the kids sum up what that would be.

360
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,972
Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be

361
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:26,978
Sage Smith-Pallotta: a real social

362
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,828
Rider Smith-Pallotta: innovation.

363
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,899
Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much.

364
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,178
Thank you.

365
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:39,149
(Applause)

366
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,511
Thank you.

367
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,573
(Applause)
