1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
that pays all the bills.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
It's held every two years in Burma.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And I particularly remember a really good speech

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
(Laughter)

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
that what we create in advertising,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
you might call it badge value, subjective value,

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
intangible value of some kind --

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
gets rather a bad rap.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,820
where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
You can either live in a world which is poorer,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
which people in general don't like.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
constitutes a greater part of overall value,

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
that actually intangible value, in many ways

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
is a very, very fine substitute

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
for using up labor or limited resources

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
in the creation of things.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
The question was given to a bunch of engineers,

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,820
about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
And they came up with a very good engineering solution,

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
which was to spend six billion pounds

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
building completely new tracks

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
from London to the coast,

31
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,820
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
merely to make it shorter.

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
and female supermodels,

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,820
pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
for the entire duration of the journey.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
(Laughter)

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
(Applause)

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,820
(Laughter)

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.

48
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
And this shows that engineers,

49
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
medical people, scientific people,

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.

53
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
So I'll ask you another question.

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
What on earth is wrong with placebos?

55
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
They work extraordinarily well.

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
They have no side effects,

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
(Laughter)

60
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
and actually produce placebo education.

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,820
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.

65
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
It actually works by giving you the impression

66
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense

67
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
of unwarranted self-confidence,

68
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
which then makes you very, very successful in later life.

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.

70
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
(Laughter)

71
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
(Applause)

72
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
How many problems of life can be solved

74
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
actually by tinkering with perception,

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
of actually trying to change reality?

77
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
but doing a bit of historical research,

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
it seems to be Fredrick the Great.

80
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen

81
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,

83
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,820
wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And you get a far lower risk of famine,

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --

88
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
rather like contemporary Scottish people.

89
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
(Laughter)

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
The Prussian peasantry said,

92
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.

93
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."

94
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
There are even records of people being executed

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
for refusing to grow potatoes.

96
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So he tried plan B.

97
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato

98
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.

99
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And he planted it in a royal potato patch,

100
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
with guards who had instructions

101
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
to guard over it, night and day,

102
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
(Laughter)

104
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one

105
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,

106
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
it's worth stealing.

107
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Before long, there was a massive underground

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
potato-growing operation in Germany.

109
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,820
What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
It was an absolute masterpiece.

111
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."

113
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,

114
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
in Turkey, to modernize it.

116
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.

117
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback

118
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
and a hell of a lot of resistance.

119
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.

120
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.

121
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,820
(Laughter)

122
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
(Applause)

123
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:

125
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
All convicted child molesters

126
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.

127
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,820
(Laughter)

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.

129
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Which is that, actually, first one,

130
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
all value is actually relative.

131
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
All value is perceived value.

132
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."

133
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso

134
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
decided to practice price discrimination

136
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.

138
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,820
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.

139
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
These funny signs that flash your speed at you,

141
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
some of the new ones, on the bottom right,

142
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,

143
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
to act as an emotional trigger.

144
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent

145
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,

146
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
but they prevent twice as many accidents.

147
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling

148
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
to conventional, classically trained economists,

149
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
is that a weird little smiley face

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
has a better effect on changing your behavior

151
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Tiny little behavioral economics detail:

153
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
in Italy, penalty points go backwards.

154
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
You start with 12 and they take them away.

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Because they found that loss aversion

156
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.

157
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Not so in Italy.

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value

160
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,

161
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:

162
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.

163
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,

164
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And it was replaced with replica jewelry

166
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
made of cast iron.

167
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."

168
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,

169
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia

170
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
wasn't made of gold or diamonds.

171
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
It was made of cast iron.

172
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
of having gold jewelry. This actually

174
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
had symbolic value, badge value.

175
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.

176
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.

177
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
(Laughter)

178
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,

179
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --

180
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
there are opposite kind of things

181
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
where actually the value in them depends on them being

182
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.

183
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.

184
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,

185
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,820
where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,

186
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
it was almost a block in the economy in New England,

187
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on

188
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.

189
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures

190
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
which lead to more egalitarian societies.

191
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
What's also interesting, if you look at products

192
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
that have a high component

193
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
of what you might call messaging value,

194
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:

195
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
They are often quite egalitarian.

196
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something

197
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
which replaces material value with symbolic value.

198
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,

199
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,

200
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.

201
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States

203
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,820
can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."

204
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --

205
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
it's actually a remarkable achievement,

206
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
to produce something that's that democratic.

207
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.

208
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
There is a basic view that real value involves making things,

209
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
involves labor. It involves engineering.

210
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
It involves limited raw materials.

211
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.

212
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.

213
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
It patently veers toward propaganda.

214
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
However, what we do have now

215
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
is a much more variegated media ecosystem

216
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.

217
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood

218
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
as translated into food.

219
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,

220
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.

221
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
(Laughter)

222
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
And on your right you have a dependent public

223
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.

224
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
(Laughter)

225
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Nowadays, the user is actually involved.

226
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."

227
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.

228
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
(Laughter)

229
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
This is actually called a mash-up,

230
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
where you take content that someone else has produced

231
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and you do something new with it.

232
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
In the world of food we call it cooking.

233
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
This is food 2.0,

234
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.

235
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.

236
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,

237
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
the pie, the sandwich.

238
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
We invented the whole lot of them.

239
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,

240
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
but it's not very portable, generally.

241
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,820
(Laughter)

242
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.

243
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.

244
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
(Laughter)

245
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Finally, we have contextual communication.

246
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.

247
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.

248
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
It tastes great within the borders of that country,

249
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.

250
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
(Laughter)

251
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Unicum in Hungary, for example.

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,

253
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.

254
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
(Laughter)

255
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
But so much communication now is contextual

256
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
that the capacity for actually nudging people,

257
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
at the University of Stanford, makes the point

259
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
that actually the mobile phone is --

260
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."

261
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,

262
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
contextual, timely and immediate,

263
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.

264
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,

265
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
we simply have to ask the question,

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.

267
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
I'll give you one example.

268
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,

269
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,

270
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
put 50 dollars into your pension,

271
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
you would save a lot more.

272
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines

273
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
the behavior. Okay?

274
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating

275
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
opportunities for impulse buying.

276
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.

277
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
If you did this, more people would save more.

278
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
It's simply a question of changing the interface

279
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
by which people make decisions,

280
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
and the very nature of the decisions changes.

281
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Obviously, I don't want people to do this,

282
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just

283
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
consumerism needlessly postponed.

284
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
(Laughter)

285
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
But if anybody did want to do that,

286
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:

287
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.

288
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Now, I've got an example here from Canada.

289
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada

290
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
called Hunter Somerville,

291
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
who was working in improv in Toronto,

292
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and got a part-time job in advertising,

293
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.

294
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Now this is the most perfect case of creating

295
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
intangible, added value,

296
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
without changing the product in the slightest.

297
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,

298
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.

299
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.

300
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
(Laughter)

301
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,

302
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
he came up with this.

303
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Video: (Buzzer)

304
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.

305
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,820
(Laughter)

306
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?

307
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
(Laughter)

308
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.

309
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.

310
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,820
(Applause)

311
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example

312
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
of intangible value creation. All it requires is

313
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.

314
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I would say it's a work of genius.

315
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.

316
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,

317
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
which is something very exciting for them.

318
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.

319
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,820
(Laughter)

320
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,

321
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.

322
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
(Laughter)

323
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Woman: Weren't they square?

324
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.

325
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.

326
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,

327
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
if you flip it over it looks like a nine.

328
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
But a six is very different from a nine.

329
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.

330
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Man #2: [unclear]

331
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that

332
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
it's more interesting looking.

333
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Man: Just try both of them.

334
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Take a square one there, first.

335
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:14,820
(Laughter)

336
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.

337
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Man: The first one?

338
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
(Laughter)

339
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.

340
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,

341
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
who actually resented this intrusion.

342
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually

343
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.

344
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
(Laughter)

345
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:45,820
(Applause)

346
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,820
(Laughter)

347
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called

348
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
the American Institute of Wine Economics,

349
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
which actually does extensive research into perception of things,

350
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
and discovers that except for among

351
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,

352
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment

353
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
in wine,

354
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
except when you tell the people how expensive it is,

355
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.

356
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
So drink your wine blind in the future.

357
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
But this is both hysterically funny --

358
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
but I think an important philosophical point,

359
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.

360
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,

361
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
and less time agonizing over what else we can do.

362
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Two quotations to more or less end with.

363
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things

364
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
familiar and familiar things new."

365
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,

366
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also

367
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,820
to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on

368
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
those things which are already existing.

369
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.

370
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Because they help people share news.

371
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,820
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.

372
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,

373
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
and increase the kind of third-party

374
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,820
enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.

375
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,

376
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"

377
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.

378
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,

379
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
love, sex and other things,

380
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and learn to place a material value

381
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
on what you've previously discounted

382
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,

383
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.

384
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Thank you very much indeed.

385
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
(Applause)
