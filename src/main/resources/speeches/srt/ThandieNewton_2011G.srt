1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,330
Embracing otherness.

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,330
When I first heard this theme,

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,330
I thought, well, embracing otherness

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,330
is embracing myself.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,330
And the journey to that place

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,330
of understanding and acceptance

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,330
has been an interesting one for me,

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,330
and it's given me an insight

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,330
into the whole notion of self,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,330
which I think is worth sharing with you today.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,330
We each have a self,

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,330
but I don't think that we're born with one.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,330
You know how newborn babies

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,330
believe they're part of everything;

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,330
they're not separate?

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,330
Well that fundamental sense of oneness

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,330
is lost on us very quickly.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,330
It's like that initial stage is over --

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,330
oneness: infancy,

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,330
unformed, primitive.

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,330
It's no longer valid or real.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,330
What is real is separateness,

23
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,330
and at some point in early babyhood,

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,330
the idea of self

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,330
starts to form.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,330
Our little portion of oneness is given a name,

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,330
is told all kinds of things about itself,

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,330
and these details,

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,330
opinions and ideas

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,330
become facts,

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,330
which go towards building ourselves,

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,330
our identity.

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,330
And that self becomes the vehicle

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,330
for navigating our social world.

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,330
But the self is a projection

36
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,330
based on other people's projections.

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,330
Is it who we really are?

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,330
Or who we really want to be, or should be?

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,330
So this whole interaction

40
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,330
with self and identity

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,330
was a very difficult one for me growing up.

42
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,330
The self that I attempted to take out into the world

43
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,330
was rejected over and over again.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,330
And my panic

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,330
at not having a self that fit,

46
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,330
and the confusion that came

47
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,330
from my self being rejected,

48
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,330
created anxiety, shame

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
and hopelessness,

50
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,330
which kind of defined me for a long time.

51
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,330
But in retrospect,

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,330
the destruction of my self was so repetitive

53
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,330
that I started to see a pattern.

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,330
The self changed,

55
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,330
got affected, broken, destroyed,

56
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,330
but another one would evolve --

57
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,330
sometimes stronger,

58
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,330
sometimes hateful,

59
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,330
sometimes not wanting to be there at all.

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,330
The self was not constant.

61
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,330
And how many times

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,330
would my self have to die

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,330
before I realized

64
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,330
that it was never alive in the first place?

65
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,330
I grew up on the coast of England

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,330
in the '70s.

67
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,330
My dad is white from Cornwall,

68
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,330
and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.

69
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,330
Even the idea of us as a family

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,330
was challenging to most people.

71
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,330
But nature had its wicked way,

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,330
and brown babies were born.

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
But from about the age of five,

74
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,330
I was aware that I didn't fit.

75
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,330
I was the black atheist kid

76
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,330
in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,330
I was an anomaly,

78
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,330
and my self was rooting around for definition

79
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,330
and trying to plug in.

80
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,330
Because the self likes to fit,

81
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,330
to see itself replicated,

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,330
to belong.

83
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,330
That confirms its existence

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,330
and its importance.

85
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,330
And it is important.

86
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,330
It has an extremely important function.

87
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,330
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.

88
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,330
We can't hatch plans

89
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,330
and climb that stairway of popularity,

90
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,330
of success.

91
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,330
But my skin color wasn't right.

92
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,330
My hair wasn't right.

93
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,330
My history wasn't right.

94
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,330
My self became defined

95
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,330
by otherness,

96
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,330
which meant that, in that social world,

97
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,330
I didn't really exist.

98
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,330
And I was "other" before being anything else --

99
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,330
even before being a girl.

100
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,330
I was a noticeable nobody.

101
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,330
Another world was opening up

102
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,330
around this time:

103
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,330
performance and dancing.

104
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,330
That nagging dread of self-hood

105
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,330
didn't exist when I was dancing.

106
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,330
I'd literally lose myself.

107
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,330
And I was a really good dancer.

108
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,330
I would put

109
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,330
all my emotional expression

110
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,330
into my dancing.

111
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,330
I could be in the movement

112
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,330
in a way that I wasn't able to be

113
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,330
in my real life, in myself.

114
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,330
And at 16,

115
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,330
I stumbled across another opportunity,

116
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,330
and I earned my first acting role in a film.

117
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,330
I can hardly find the words

118
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,330
to describe the peace I felt

119
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,330
when I was acting.

120
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,330
My dysfunctional self

121
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
could actually plug in

122
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,330
to another self, not my own,

123
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,330
and it felt so good.

124
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,330
It was the first time that I existed

125
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,330
inside a fully-functioning self --

126
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,330
one that I controlled,

127
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,330
that I steered,

128
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,330
that I gave life to.

129
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,330
But the shooting day would end,

130
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,330
and I'd return

131
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,330
to my gnarly, awkward self.

132
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,330
By 19,

133
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,330
I was a fully-fledged movie actor,

134
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,330
but still searching for definition.

135
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,330
I applied to read anthropology

136
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,330
at university.

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,330
Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,330
and she asked me, "How would you define race?"

139
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,330
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,

140
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,330
and I said, "Skin color."

141
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,330
"So biology, genetics?" she said.

142
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,330
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.

143
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,330
Because there's actually more genetic difference

144
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,330
between a black Kenyan

145
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,330
and a black Ugandan

146
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,330
than there is between a black Kenyan

147
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,330
and, say, a white Norwegian.

148
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,330
Because we all stem from Africa.

149
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,330
So in Africa,

150
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,330
there's been more time

151
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,330
to create genetic diversity."

152
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,330
In other words,

153
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,330
race has no basis

154
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,330
in biological or scientific fact.

155
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,330
On the one hand, result.

156
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,330
Right?

157
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,330
On the other hand, my definition of self

158
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,330
just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.

159
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,330
But what was credible,

160
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,330
what is biological and scientific fact,

161
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,330
is that we all stem from Africa --

162
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,330
in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve

163
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,330
who lived 160,000 years ago.

164
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,330
And race is an illegitimate concept

165
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,330
which our selves have created

166
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,330
based on fear and ignorance.

167
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,330
Strangely, these revelations

168
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,330
didn't cure my low self-esteem,

169
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,330
that feeling of otherness.

170
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,330
My desire to disappear

171
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,330
was still very powerful.

172
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,330
I had a degree from Cambridge;

173
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,330
I had a thriving career,

174
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,330
but my self was a car crash,

175
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,330
and I wound up with bulimia

176
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,330
and on a therapist's couch.

177
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,330
And of course I did.

178
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,330
I still believed

179
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,330
my self was all I was.

180
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,330
I still valued self-worth

181
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,330
above all other worth,

182
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,330
and what was there to suggest otherwise?

183
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,330
We've created entire value systems

184
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,330
and a physical reality

185
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,330
to support the worth of self.

186
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,330
Look at the industry for self-image

187
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,330
and the jobs it creates,

188
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,330
the revenue it turns over.

189
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,330
We'd be right in assuming

190
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,330
that the self is an actual living thing.

191
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,330
But it's not. It's a projection

192
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,330
which our clever brains create

193
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,330
in order to cheat ourselves

194
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,330
from the reality of death.

195
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,330
But there is something

196
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,330
that can give the self

197
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,330
ultimate and infinite connection --

198
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,330
and that thing is oneness,

199
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,330
our essence.

200
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,330
The self's struggle

201
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,330
for authenticity and definition

202
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,330
will never end

203
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,330
unless it's connected to its creator --

204
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,330
to you and to me.

205
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,330
And that can happen with awareness --

206
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,330
awareness of the reality of oneness

207
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,330
and the projection of self-hood.

208
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,330
For a start, we can think about

209
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,330
all the times when we do lose ourselves.

210
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,330
It happens when I dance,

211
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,330
when I'm acting.

212
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,330
I'm earthed in my essence,

213
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,330
and my self is suspended.

214
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,330
In those moments,

215
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,330
I'm connected to everything --

216
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,330
the ground, the air,

217
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,330
the sounds, the energy from the audience.

218
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,330
All my senses are alert and alive

219
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,330
in much the same way as an infant might feel --

220
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,330
that feeling of oneness.

221
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,330
And when I'm acting a role,

222
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,330
I inhabit another self,

223
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,330
and I give it life for awhile,

224
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,330
because when the self is suspended

225
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,330
so is divisiveness

226
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,330
and judgment.

227
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,330
And I've played everything

228
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,330
from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery

229
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,330
to Secretary of State in 2004.

230
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,330
And no matter how other

231
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,330
these selves might be,

232
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,330
they're all related in me.

233
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,330
And I honestly believe

234
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,330
the key to my success as an actor

235
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,330
and my progress as a person

236
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,330
has been the very lack of self

237
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,330
that used to make me feel

238
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,330
so anxious and insecure.

239
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,330
I always wondered

240
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,330
why I could feel others' pain so deeply,

241
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,330
why I could recognize

242
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,330
the somebody in the nobody.

243
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,330
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.

244
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,330
I thought I lacked substance,

245
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,330
and the fact that I could feel others'

246
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,330
meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.

247
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,330
The thing that was a source of shame

248
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,330
was actually a source of enlightenment.

249
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,330
And when I realized

250
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,330
and really understood

251
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,330
that my self is a projection and that it has a function,

252
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,330
a funny thing happened.

253
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,330
I stopped giving it so much authority.

254
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,330
I give it its due.

255
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,330
I take it to therapy.

256
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,330
I've become very familiar

257
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,330
with its dysfunctional behavior.

258
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,330
But I'm not ashamed of my self.

259
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,330
In fact, I respect my self

260
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,330
and its function.

261
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,330
And over time and with practice,

262
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,330
I've tried to live

263
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,330
more and more from my essence.

264
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,330
And if you can do that,

265
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,330
incredible things happen.

266
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,330
I was in Congo in February,

267
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,330
dancing and celebrating

268
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,330
with women who've survived

269
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,330
the destruction of their selves

270
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,330
in literally unthinkable ways --

271
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,330
destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves

272
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,330
all over that beautiful land

273
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,330
are fueling our selves' addiction

274
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,330
to iPods, Pads, and bling,

275
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,330
which further disconnect ourselves

276
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,330
from ever feeling their pain,

277
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,330
their suffering,

278
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,330
their death.

279
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,330
Because, hey,

280
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,330
if we're all living in ourselves

281
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,330
and mistaking it for life,

282
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,330
then we're devaluing

283
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,330
and desensitizing life.

284
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,330
And in that disconnected state,

285
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,330
yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,

286
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,330
destroy marine life

287
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,330
and use rape as a weapon of war.

288
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,330
So here's a note to self:

289
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,330
The cracks have started to show

290
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,330
in our constructed world,

291
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,330
and oceans will continue

292
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,330
to surge through the cracks,

293
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,330
and oil and blood,

294
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,330
rivers of it.

295
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,330
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out

296
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,330
how to live in oneness

297
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,330
with the Earth and every other living thing.

298
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,330
We've just been insanely trying to figure out

299
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,330
how to live with each other -- billions of each other.

300
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,330
Only we're not living with each other;

301
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,330
our crazy selves are living with each other

302
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,330
and perpetuating an epidemic

303
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,330
of disconnection.

304
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,330
Let's live with each other

305
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,330
and take it a breath at a time.

306
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,330
If we can get under that heavy self,

307
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,330
light a torch of awareness,

308
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,330
and find our essence,

309
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,330
our connection to the infinite

310
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,330
and every other living thing.

311
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,330
We knew it from the day we were born.

312
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,330
Let's not be freaked out

313
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,330
by our bountiful nothingness.

314
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,330
It's more a reality

315
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,330
than the ones our selves have created.

316
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,330
Imagine what kind of existence we can have

317
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,330
if we honor inevitable death of self,

318
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,330
appreciate the privilege of life

319
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,330
and marvel at what comes next.

320
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,330
Simple awareness is where it begins.

321
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,330
Thank you for listening.

322
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:49,330
(Applause)
