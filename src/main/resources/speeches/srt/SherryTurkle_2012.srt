1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Just a moment ago,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,820
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
Her text said,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
"Mom, you will rock."

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
I love this.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Getting that text

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
was like getting a hug.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
And so there you have it.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
I embody

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
the central paradox.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm a woman

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
who loves getting texts

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
who's going to tell you

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
that too many of them can be a problem.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
Actually that reminder of my daughter

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
brings me to the beginning of my story.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,820
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Rebecca was five years old

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
and she was sitting right there

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
in the front row.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
I had just written a book

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
that celebrated our life on the internet

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and I was about to be on the cover

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
of Wired magazine.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
In those heady days,

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
we were experimenting

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
with chat rooms and online virtual communities.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,820
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
And then we unplugged.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I was excited.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
And, as a psychologist, what excited me most

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
was the idea

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
that we would use what we learned in the virtual world

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
about ourselves, about our identity,

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
to live better lives in the real world.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
Now fast-forward to 2012.

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm back here on the TED stage again.

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
She sleeps with her cellphone,

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
so do I.

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And I've just written a new book,

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
but this time it's not one

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
that will get me on the cover

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
of Wired magazine.

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
So what happened?

46
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
I'm still excited by technology,

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
but I believe,

48
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
and I'm here to make the case,

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
that we're letting it take us places

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
that we don't want to go.

51
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Over the past 15 years,

52
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I've studied technologies of mobile communication

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,

54
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
young and old,

55
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
about their plugged in lives.

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
And what I've found

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
is that our little devices,

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
those little devices in our pockets,

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
are so psychologically powerful

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,820
that they don't only change what we do,

61
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
they change who we are.

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Some of the things we do now with our devices

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
are things that, only a few years ago,

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
we would have found odd

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
or disturbing,

66
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
but they've quickly come to seem familiar,

67
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
just how we do things.

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
So just to take some quick examples:

69
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
People text or do email

70
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
during corporate board meetings.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
They text and shop and go on Facebook

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
during classes, during presentations,

73
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
actually during all meetings.

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
People talk to me about the important new skill

75
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
of making eye contact

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
while you're texting.

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
(Laughter)

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
People explain to me

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
that it's hard, but that it can be done.

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Parents text and do email

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
at breakfast and at dinner

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
while their children complain

83
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
about not having their parents' full attention.

84
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
But then these same children

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
deny each other their full attention.

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
This is a recent shot

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
of my daughter and her friends

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
being together

89
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
while not being together.

90
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
And we even text at funerals.

91
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
I study this.

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
We remove ourselves

93
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
from our grief or from our revery

94
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and we go into our phones.

95
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Why does this matter?

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
It matters to me

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --

98
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
trouble certainly

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
in how we relate to each other,

100
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
but also trouble

101
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
in how we relate to ourselves

102
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
and our capacity for self-reflection.

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
We're getting used to a new way

104
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
of being alone together.

105
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
People want to be with each other,

106
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
but also elsewhere --

107
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
connected to all the different places they want to be.

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
People want to customize their lives.

109
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
They want to go in and out of all the places they are

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
because the thing that matters most to them

111
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
is control over where they put their attention.

112
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
So you want to go to that board meeting,

113
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
but you only want to pay attention

114
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
to the bits that interest you.

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And some people think that's a good thing.

116
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
But you can end up

117
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
hiding from each other,

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
even as we're all constantly connected to each other.

119
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
A 50-year-old business man

120
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
lamented to me

121
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.

122
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
he doesn't call.

124
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
because, he says, "They're too busy on their email."

126
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
But then he stops himself

127
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.

128
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.

129
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
I think I should want to,

130
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,820
but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Across the generations,

132
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,820
I see that people can't get enough of each other,

133
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
if and only if

134
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
they can have each other at a distance,

135
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
in amounts they can control.

136
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I call it the Goldilocks effect:

137
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
not too close, not too far,

138
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
just right.

139
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
But what might feel just right

140
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
for that middle-aged executive

141
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
can be a problem for an adolescent

142
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,820
who needs to develop face-to-face relationships.

143
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
An 18-year-old boy

144
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
who uses texting for almost everything

145
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
says to me wistfully,

146
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
"Someday, someday,

147
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
but certainly not now,

148
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,820
I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."

149
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
When I ask people

150
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
"What's wrong with having a conversation?"

151
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,820
People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.

152
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
It takes place in real time

153
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,820
and you can't control what you're going to say."

154
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
So that's the bottom line.

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Texting, email, posting,

156
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
all of these things

157
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,820
let us present the self as we want to be.

158
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
We get to edit,

159
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
and that means we get to delete,

160
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
and that means we get to retouch,

161
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
the face, the voice,

162
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
the flesh, the body --

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
not too little, not too much,

164
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
just right.

165
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Human relationships

166
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
are rich and they're messy

167
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
and they're demanding.

168
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
And we clean them up with technology.

169
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
And when we do,

170
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
one of the things that can happen

171
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
is that we sacrifice conversation

172
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
for mere connection.

173
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
We short-change ourselves.

174
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
And over time,

175
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
we seem to forget this,

176
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
or we seem to stop caring.

177
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
I was caught off guard

178
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
when Stephen Colbert

179
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,820
asked me a profound question,

180
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
a profound question.

181
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,820
He said, "Don't all those little tweets,

182
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
don't all those little sips

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
of online communication,

184
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
add up to one big gulp

185
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,820
of real conversation?"

186
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
My answer was no,

187
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
they don't add up.

188
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Connecting in sips may work

189
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,820
for gathering discreet bits of information,

190
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,820
they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"

191
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
or even for saying, "I love you," --

192
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I mean, look at how I felt

193
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
when I got that text from my daughter --

194
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
but they don't really work

195
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
for learning about each other,

196
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
for really coming to know and understand each other.

197
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
And we use conversations with each other

198
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
to learn how to have conversations

199
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
with ourselves.

200
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
So a flight from conversation

201
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
can really matter

202
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
because it can compromise

203
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
our capacity for self-reflection.

204
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
For kids growing up,

205
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,820
that skill is the bedrock of development.

206
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Over and over I hear,

207
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
"I would rather text than talk."

208
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
And what I'm seeing

209
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
is that people get so used to being short-changed

210
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
out of real conversation,

211
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
so used to getting by with less,

212
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
that they've become almost willing

213
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
to dispense with people altogether.

214
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So for example,

215
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
many people share with me this wish,

216
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
that some day a more advanced version of Siri,

217
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,

218
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
will be more like a best friend,

219
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
someone who will listen

220
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
when others won't.

221
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
I believe this wish

222
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
reflects a painful truth

223
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
that I've learned in the past 15 years.

224
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,820
That feeling that no one is listening to me

225
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
is very important

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
in our relationships with technology.

227
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
That's why it's so appealing

228
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
to have a Facebook page

229
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
or a Twitter feed --

230
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
so many automatic listeners.

231
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
And the feeling that no one is listening to me

232
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
make us want to spend time

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
with machines that seem to care about us.

234
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
We're developing robots,

235
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
they call them sociable robots,

236
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
that are specifically designed to be companions --

237
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
to the elderly,

238
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
to our children,

239
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
to us.

240
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Have we so lost confidence

241
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,820
that we will be there for each other?

242
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
During my research

243
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I worked in nursing homes,

244
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
and I brought in these sociable robots

245
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
that were designed to give the elderly

246
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
the feeling that they were understood.

247
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And one day I came in

248
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
and a woman who had lost a child

249
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
was talking to a robot

250
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,820
in the shape of a baby seal.

251
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.

252
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
It seemed to be following the conversation.

253
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
It comforted her.

254
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,820
And many people found this amazing.

255
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,820
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life

256
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
with a machine that had no experience

257
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
of the arc of a human life.

258
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
That robot put on a great show.

259
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And we're vulnerable.

260
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
People experience pretend empathy

261
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
as though it were the real thing.

262
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
So during that moment

263
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
when that woman

264
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
was experiencing that pretend empathy,

265
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
It doesn't face death.

267
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It doesn't know life."

268
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
And as that woman took comfort

269
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
in her robot companion,

270
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
I didn't find it amazing;

271
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,820
I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments

272
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,820
in my 15 years of work.

273
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
But when I stepped back,

274
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I felt myself

275
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
at the cold, hard center

276
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
of a perfect storm.

277
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
We expect more from technology

278
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
and less from each other.

279
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
And I ask myself,

280
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
"Why have things come to this?"

281
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
And I believe it's because

282
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
technology appeals to us most

283
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
where we are most vulnerable.

284
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
And we are vulnerable.

285
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
We're lonely,

286
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
but we're afraid of intimacy.

287
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
And so from social networks to sociable robots,

288
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
we're designing technologies

289
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
that will give us the illusion of companionship

290
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
without the demands of friendship.

291
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
We turn to technology to help us feel connected

292
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
in ways we can comfortably control.

293
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
But we're not so comfortable.

294
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
We are not so much in control.

295
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
These days, those phones in our pockets

296
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
are changing our minds and hearts

297
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
because they offer us

298
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
three gratifying fantasies.

299
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
One, that we can put our attention

300
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
wherever we want it to be;

301
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
two, that we will always be heard;

302
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
and three, that we will never have to be alone.

303
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
And that third idea,

304
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
that we will never have to be alone,

305
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
is central to changing our psyches.

306
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Because the moment that people are alone,

307
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
even for a few seconds,

308
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
they become anxious, they panic, they fidget,

309
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
they reach for a device.

310
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Just think of people at a checkout line

311
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
or at a red light.

312
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.

313
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
And so people try to solve it by connecting.

314
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
But here, connection

315
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
is more like a symptom than a cure.

316
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
It expresses, but it doesn't solve,

317
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
an underlying problem.

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
But more than a symptom,

319
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
constant connection is changing

320
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
the way people think of themselves.

321
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
It's shaping a new way of being.

322
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
The best way to describe it is,

323
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I share therefore I am.

324
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
We use technology to define ourselves

325
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
by sharing our thoughts and feelings

326
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
even as we're having them.

327
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
So before it was:

328
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
I have a feeling,

329
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
I want to make a call.

330
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Now it's: I want to have a feeling,

331
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
I need to send a text.

332
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
The problem with this new regime

333
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
of "I share therefore I am"

334
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
is that, if we don't have connection,

335
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
we don't feel like ourselves.

336
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
We almost don't feel ourselves.

337
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
So what do we do? We connect more and more.

338
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
But in the process,

339
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
we set ourselves up to be isolated.

340
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,820
How do you get from connection to isolation?

341
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
You end up isolated

342
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,

343
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
the ability to be separate,

344
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
to gather yourself.

345
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Solitude is where you find yourself

346
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
so that you can reach out to other people

347
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
and form real attachments.

348
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
When we don't have the capacity for solitude,

349
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious

350
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
or in order to feel alive.

351
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
When this happens,

352
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
we're not able to appreciate who they are.

353
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
It's as though we're using them

354
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
as spare parts

355
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
to support our fragile sense of self.

356
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
We slip into thinking that always being connected

357
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
is going to make us feel less alone.

358
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
But we're at risk,

359
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
because actually it's the opposite that's true.

360
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
If we're not able to be alone,

361
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
we're going to be more lonely.

362
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
And if we don't teach our children to be alone,

363
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
they're only going to know

364
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
how to be lonely.

365
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
When I spoke at TED in 1996,

366
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
reporting on my studies

367
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
of the early virtual communities,

368
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I said, "Those who make the most

369
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
of their lives on the screen

370
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."

371
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
And that's what I'm calling for here, now:

372
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
reflection and, more than that, a conversation

373
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
about where our current use of technology

374
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
may be taking us,

375
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
what it might be costing us.

376
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
We're smitten with technology.

377
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And we're afraid, like young lovers,

378
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
that too much talking might spoil the romance.

379
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
But it's time to talk.

380
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
We grew up with digital technology

381
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
and so we see it as all grown up.

382
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
But it's not, it's early days.

383
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
There's plenty of time

384
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
for us to reconsider how we use it,

385
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
how we build it.

386
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm not suggesting

387
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
that we turn away from our devices,

388
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
just that we develop a more self-aware relationship

389
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
with them, with each other

390
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
and with ourselves.

391
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
I see some first steps.

392
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Start thinking of solitude

393
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
as a good thing.

394
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Make room for it.

395
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Find ways to demonstrate this

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
as a value to your children.

397
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Create sacred spaces at home --

398
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
the kitchen, the dining room --

399
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
and reclaim them for conversation.

400
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Do the same thing at work.

401
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
At work, we're so busy communicating

402
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
that we often don't have time to think,

403
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
we don't have time to talk,

404
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
about the things that really matter.

405
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Change that.

406
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other,

407
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,820
including to the boring bits.

408
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Because it's when we stumble

409
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
or hesitate or lose our words

410
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
that we reveal ourselves to each other.

411
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Technology is making a bid

412
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
to redefine human connection --

413
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
how we care for each other,

414
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
how we care for ourselves --

415
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
but it's also giving us the opportunity

416
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
to affirm our values

417
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
and our direction.

418
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm optimistic.

419
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820
We have everything we need to start.

420
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
We have each other.

421
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
And we have the greatest chance of success

422
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
if we recognize our vulnerability.

423
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
That we listen

424
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
when technology says

425
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
it will take something complicated

426
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
and promises something simpler.

427
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
So in my work,

428
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
I hear that life is hard,

429
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
relationships are filled with risk.

430
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
And then there's technology --

431
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
simpler, hopeful,

432
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
optimistic, ever-young.

433
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
It's like calling in the cavalry.

434
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
An ad campaign promises

435
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
that online and with avatars,

436
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,820
you can "Finally, love your friends

437
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
love your body, love your life,

438
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
online and with avatars."

439
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
We're drawn to virtual romance,

440
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
to computer games that seem like worlds,

441
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,820
to the idea that robots, robots,

442
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
will someday be our true companions.

443
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
We spend an evening on the social network

444
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
instead of going to the pub with friends.

445
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
But our fantasies of substitution

446
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
have cost us.

447
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Now we all need to focus

448
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
on the many, many ways

449
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
technology can lead us back

450
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
to our real lives, our own bodies,

451
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
our own communities,

452
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
our own politics,

453
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
our own planet.

454
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
They need us.

455
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Let's talk about

456
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
how we can use digital technology,

457
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,820
the technology of our dreams,

458
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
to make this life

459
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
the life we can love.

460
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Thank you.

461
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,820
(Applause)
