1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I work with a species called "Bonobo."

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
And I'm happy most of the time,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
It's kind of a well-kept secret.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
This species lives only in the Congo.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,820
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
Their sexual behavior is too human-like

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
for most of us to be comfortable with.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,820
(Laughter)

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,820
But --

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,820
(Laughter)

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,820
actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,820
egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,820
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
that they sort of set aside.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
It permeates their entire life.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
And it's used for communication.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
And it's used for conflict resolution.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,820
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
divided our lives up into lots of parts.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,820
We divided our world up with lots of categories.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,820
But I don't think that we were that way initially.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,820
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
and that there's something very, very special about man.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Maybe it's something special in his brain

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
that allows him to have language.

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Maybe it's something special in his brain

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,820
around the 1600s and they had no fire.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
They had no stone tools.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
To our knowledge they had no music.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
So when you compare them to the Bonobo,

36
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
the Bonobo is a little hairier.

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,820
He doesn't stand quite as upright.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
But there are a lot of similarities.

39
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,820
And I think that as we look at culture,

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
we kind of come to understand

41
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
how we got to where we are.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
And I don't really think it's in our biology;

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
I think we've attributed it to our biology,

44
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
but I don't really think it's there.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
So what I want to do now is introduce you

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
to a species called the Bonobo.

47
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
This is Kanzi.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
He's a Bonobo.

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.

50
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,820
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And she came to us when she was just at puberty,

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
about six or seven years of age.

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
and a chimpanzee on your left.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,820
is more upright, just as we are.

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,820
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.

59
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference

60
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
between the way a Bonobo walks

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,820
and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.

62
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
As they turn toward us you'll see

63
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,820
that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,820
and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.

66
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
And now we see all four.

67
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,820
Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle

68
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
encircled by the Congo River.

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,

70
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,820
grow densely in the area.

71
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
It was a Japanese scientist

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,820
who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
almost three decades ago.

74
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.

75
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,820
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.

78
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,820
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.

79
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.

81
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,820
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
None of them are tricks.

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
by NHK of Japan.

85
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
We have eight Bonobos.

86
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
SS: An entire family at our research centre.

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Video: You going to help get some sticks?

89
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Good.

90
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
We need more sticks, too.

91
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.

92
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
That's a wasps' nest.

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
You can get it out.

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
I hope I have a lighter.

95
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
You can use the lighter to start the fire.

96
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.

97
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,

98
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,820
but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --

99
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
make a fire without a lighter.

100
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.

101
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
He's learning the uses for a fire,

102
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
just by watching what we do with fire.

103
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
(Laughter)

104
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.

105
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
These are happy vocalizations.

106
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Video: You're happy.

107
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
You're very happy about this part.

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,820
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Good job.

110
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.

111
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
But he likes to carry things from place to place.

112
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
farther than we can hear.

115
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
This is his sister.

116
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.

117
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Video: Goodbye.

118
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
(Laughter)

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,820
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.

120
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
She switches from reverse to forward

121
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.

122
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
(Laughter)

123
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.

124
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,820
(Music)

125
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,

126
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,820
and documenting their development across two decades,

127
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
scientists are exploring how cultural forces

128
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,820
(Laughter)

129
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
may have operated during human evolution.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
His name is Nyota.

131
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
It means "star" in Swahili.

132
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,820
(Music)

133
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.

134
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,820
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.

135
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,

136
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
to groom Nyota.

137
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Very impressive.

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required

139
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
to perform delicate tasks like this.

140
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.

141
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Panbanisha, like any human mother,

143
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
carefully tugs to get the scissors back.

144
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
He can now cut through tough animal hide.

145
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.

146
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools,

147
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
just as our ancestors may have made them,

148
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
two-and-a-half million years ago --

149
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,820
by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.

150
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
He has learned that by using both hands

151
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
and aiming his glancing blows,

152
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,820
he can make much larger, sharper flakes.

153
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.

154
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,820
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.

155
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard

156
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,820
and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,

157
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
requiring great skill.

158
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia

159
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and is identical to that used by our African ancestors

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
two-and-a-half million years ago.

161
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
These are the rocks Kanzi used

162
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
and these are the flakes he made.

163
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,820
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.

164
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;

165
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.

166
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.

167
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
She keeps staring out the window.

168
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.

169
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.

170
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
SS: I normally talk about language.

171
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.

172
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,

173
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
I haven't told you that these apes have language.

174
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
It's a geometric language.

175
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Video: She takes a piece of chalk

176
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
and begins writing something on the floor.

177
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
What is she writing?

178
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.

179
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.

180
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.

181
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
(Music)

182
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
They speak when she touches them.

183
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.

184
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.

185
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.

186
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.

187
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,820
SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.

188
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,

189
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.

190
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.

191
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.

192
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."

193
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,820
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.

194
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
SS: That's an institutional requirement.

195
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,

196
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line

197
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
and several straight lines.

198
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,

199
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.

200
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Panbanisha watched.

201
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Soon she began to write as well.

202
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.

203
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
How did they develop?

204
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
SS (video): We found that the most important thing

205
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,820
for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.

206
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
It's simply to use language around them,

207
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
because the driving force in language acquisition

208
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,820
is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.

209
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Once you have that capacity,

210
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
the ability to produce language

211
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,820
comes rather naturally and rather freely.

212
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,

213
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,820
like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --

214
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
we want to create an environment in which they have fun,

215
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
and an environment in which the others

216
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
are meaningful individuals for them.

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential

218
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
in Kanzi and Panbanisha.

219
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,

220
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,820
until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.

221
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.

222
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Is he looking for where the sound came from?

223
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.

224
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.

225
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
She wasn't forced to learn the piano;

226
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,820
she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.

227
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.

228
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.

229
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;

230
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,820
using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.

231
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Kanzi and Panbanisha

232
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,

233
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,820
which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.

234
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
(Laughter)

235
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.

236
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Take the cherries too.

237
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Now watch out, stay away from them now.

238
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.

239
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Now you have to stay away. Get away.

240
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Run away. Run.

241
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.

242
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Oh no!

243
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.

244
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?

245
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,820
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."

246
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
We're learning how to become like them.

247
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
We're learning how to communicate with them,

248
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
in really high-pitched tones.

249
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,820
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.

250
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
And they're learning to become like us.

251
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.

252
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
So we're sharing tools and technology and language

253
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
with another species.

254
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Thank you.
