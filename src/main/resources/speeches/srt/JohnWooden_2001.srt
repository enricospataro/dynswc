1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,422
I coined my own definition
of success in 1934,

2
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:19,383
when I was teaching at a high school
in South Bend, Indiana,

3
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:24,167
being a little bit disappointed,
and [disillusioned] perhaps,

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,238
by the way parents of the youngsters
in my English classes

5
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:32,111
expected their youngsters
to get an A or a B.

6
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:35,032
They thought a C was all right
for the neighbors' children,

7
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,023
because they were all average.

8
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,182
But they weren't satisfied
when their own --

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,174
it would make the teacher feel that they
had failed, or the youngster had failed.

10
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,381
And that's not right.

11
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,398
The good Lord in his infinite
wisdom didn't create us all equal

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,159
as far as intelligence is concerned,

13
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,658
any more than we're equal
for size, appearance.

14
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:55,367
Not everybody could earn an A or a B,
and I didn't like that way of judging,

15
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:59,500
and I did know how
the alumni of various schools

16
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:03,159
back in the '30s judged
coaches and athletic teams.

17
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:08,209
If you won them all, you were considered
to be reasonably successful --

18
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,387
not completely.

19
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:10,784
Because I found out --

20
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:14,171
we had a number of years at UCLA
where we didn't lose a game.

21
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,694
But it seemed that we didn't win
each individual game

22
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:20,684
by the margin that some
of our alumni had predicted --

23
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,796
(Laughter)

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,392
And quite frequently I really felt
that they had backed up their predictions

25
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,971
in a more materialistic manner.

26
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:31,153
(Laughter)

27
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:34,399
But that was true back
in the 30s, so I understood that.

28
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,583
But I didn't like it,
I didn't agree with it.

29
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:40,146
I wanted to come up with something
I hoped could make me a better teacher,

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,290
and give the youngsters
under my supervision,

31
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,432
be it in athletics
or the English classroom,

32
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:45,922
something to which to aspire,

33
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:49,489
other than just a higher
mark in the classroom,

34
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:52,143
or more points in some athletic contest.

35
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,530
I thought about that for quite a spell,

36
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,775
and I wanted to come
up with my own definition.

37
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,344
I thought that might help.

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,796
And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,

39
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,868
as the accumulation
of material possessions

40
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:07,249
or the attainment of a position of power
or prestige, or something of that sort,

41
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:09,185
worthy accomplishments perhaps,

42
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,695
but in my opinion, not necessarily
indicative of success.

43
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,106
So I wanted to come up
with something of my own.

44
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,993
And I recalled --

45
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,344
I was raised on a small farm
in Southern Indiana,

46
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:21,353
and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers

47
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:24,676
that you should never try to be
better than someone else.

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,145
I'm sure at the time he did
that, I didn't -- it didn't --

49
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,319
well, somewhere, I guess
in the hidden recesses of the mind,

50
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:32,796
it popped out years later.

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,796
Never try to be better than someone else,

52
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,273
always learn from others.

53
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,670
Never cease trying to be
the best you can be --

54
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,311
that's under your control.

55
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,796
If you get too engrossed
and involved and concerned

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,440
in regard to the things
over which you have no control,

57
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:49,179
it will adversely affect the things
over which you have control.

58
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,680
Then I ran across
this simple verse that said,

59
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,697
"At God's footstool to confess,

60
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,044
a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.

61
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:57,702
'I failed!' he cried.

62
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:01,796
The Master said, 'Thou didst
thy best, that is success.'"

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,796
From those things, and one other perhaps,

64
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,573
I coined my own definition
of success, which is:

65
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:09,883
Peace of mind attained only
through self-satisfaction

66
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:13,646
in knowing you made the effort to do
the best of which you're capable.

67
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,954
I believe that's true.

68
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:17,905
If you make the effort to do
the best of which you're capable,

69
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,562
trying to improve the situation
that exists for you,

70
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:21,739
I think that's success,

71
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:23,748
and I don't think others can judge that;

72
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,547
it's like character and reputation --

73
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,422
Your reputation
is what you're perceived to be;

74
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:30,304
your character is what you really are.

75
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:33,502
And I think that character
is much more important

76
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,296
than what you are perceived to be.

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,074
You'd hope they'd both be good,

78
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,795
but they won't necessarily be the same.

79
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,796
Well, that was my idea that I was going
to try to get across to the youngsters.

80
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,272
I ran across other things.

81
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:50,406
I love to teach, and it was
mentioned by the previous speaker

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,581
that I enjoy poetry,
and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.

83
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,796
There are some things
that helped me, I think,

84
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,596
be better than I would have been.

85
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,190
I know I'm not what I ought
to be, what I should be,

86
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,347
but I think I'm better
than I would have been

87
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:04,281
if I hadn't run across certain things.

88
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:08,131
One was just a little verse that said,

89
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:12,207
"No written word, no spoken plea

90
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,796
can teach our youth what they should be;

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,202
nor all the books on all the shelves --

92
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:19,454
it's what the teachers are themselves."

93
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,271
That made an impression
on me in the 1930s.

94
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:27,570
And I tried to use that
more or less in my teaching,

95
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:32,166
whether it be in sports, or whether
it be in the English classroom.

96
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,994
I love poetry and always had
an interest in that somehow.

97
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:41,796
Maybe it's because Dad
used to read to us at night,

98
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,978
by coal oil lamp --

99
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:46,354
we didn't have electricity
in our farm home.

100
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,258
And Dad would read poetry to us.
So I always liked it.

101
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:51,796
And about the same time
I ran across this one verse,

102
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,487
I ran across another one.

103
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:57,327
Someone asked a lady teacher
why she taught,

104
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:00,391
and after some time, she said
she wanted to think about that.

105
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,295
Then she came up and said,

106
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,208
"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,

107
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:07,732
'Where could I find
such splendid company?'

108
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:10,796
There sits a statesman,
strong, unbiased, wise;

109
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,518
another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.

110
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,796
A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,
steady hand may mend a bone,

111
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,796
or stem the life-blood's flow.

112
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,868
And there a builder; upward rise
the arch of a church he builds,

113
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:25,328
wherein that minister
may speak the word of God,

114
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,796
and lead a stumbling soul
to touch the Christ.

115
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,795
And all about, a gathering of teachers,

116
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,137
farmers, merchants, laborers --

117
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,813
those who work and vote and build

118
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:36,208
and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.

119
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:39,550
And I may say, I may not see the church,

120
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:42,392
or hear the word, or eat
the food their hands may grow,

121
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,653
but yet again I may;

122
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,828
And later I may say,

123
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:48,907
I knew him once, and he was weak,
or strong, or bold or proud or gay.

124
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,276
I knew him once, but then he was a boy.

125
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,570
They ask me why I teach and I reply,

126
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,244
'Where could I find such
splendid company?'"

127
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,196
And I believe the teaching profession --

128
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,282
It's true, you have so many youngsters,

129
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,695
and I've got to think
of my youngsters at UCLA --

130
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,531
30-some attorneys,
11 dentists and doctors,

131
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,796
many, many teachers and other professions.

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,618
And that gives you
a great deal of pleasure,

133
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,246
to see them go on.

134
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,334
I always tried to make the youngsters feel
that they're there to get an education,

135
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,562
number one; basketball was second,
because it was paying their way,

136
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:26,093
and they do need a little time
for social activities,

137
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,704
but you let social activities take
a little precedence over the other two,

138
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,057
and you're not going
to have any very long.

139
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:36,796
So that was the idea
that I tried to get across

140
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,247
to the youngsters under my supervision.

141
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:41,077
I had three rules, pretty much,

142
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,422
that I stuck with
practically all the time.

143
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:47,374
I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,
and I decided they were very important.

144
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:51,298
One was "Never be late."

145
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:55,567
Later on I said certain things --

146
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:59,796
the players, if we were leaving
for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.

147
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,796
There was a time when I made them
wear jackets and shirts and ties.

148
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,605
Then I saw our chancellor coming
to school in denims and turtlenecks,

149
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,596
and thought, it's not right for me to keep
this other [rule] so I let them just --

150
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,200
they had to be neat and clean.

151
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:21,853
I had one of my greatest players
that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.

152
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:25,570
He came to catch the bus; we were
leaving for somewhere to play.

153
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:28,924
And he wasn't clean and neat,
so I wouldn't let him go.

154
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,332
He couldn't get on the bus,

155
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,266
he had to go home and get cleaned up

156
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,417
to get to the airport.

157
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,796
So I was a stickler for that.
I believed in that.

158
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,704
I believe in time; very important.

159
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:42,376
I believe you should be on time,
but I felt at practice, for example --

160
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,416
we start on time, we close on time.

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,837
The youngsters didn't have to feel
that we were going to keep them over.

162
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,853
When I speak at coaching clinics,
I often tell young coaches --

163
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:53,017
and at coaching clinics, more or less,

164
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,025
they'll be the younger coaches
getting in the profession.

165
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:59,533
Most of them are young, you know,
and probably newly-married.

166
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,572
And I tell them,
"Don't run practices late,

167
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:04,625
because you'll go home in a bad mood,

168
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,997
and that's not good, for a young
married man to go home in a bad mood.

169
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,988
When you get older, it doesn't
make any difference, but --"

170
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,796
(Laughter)

171
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,087
So I did believe: on-time.

172
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:19,236
I believe starting on time,
and I believe closing on time.

173
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,796
And another one I had was,
not one word of profanity.

174
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,796
One word of profanity,
and you are out of here for the day.

175
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,106
If I see it in a game, you're going
to come out and sit on the bench.

176
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,796
And the third one was,
never criticize a teammate.

177
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,796
I didn't want that. I used to tell
them I was paid to do that.

178
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,796
That's my job. I'm paid to do it.
Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.

179
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,796
Not like the coaches today,
for gracious sakes, no.

180
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,208
It's a little different
than it was in my day.

181
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:50,913
Those were three things that I stuck
with pretty closely all the time.

182
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,555
And those actually came from my dad.

183
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:58,476
That's what he tried to teach
me and my brothers at one time.

184
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,374
I came up with a pyramid eventually,

185
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:04,104
that I don't have the time to go on that.

186
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,358
But that helped me, I think,
become a better teacher.

187
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:09,303
It's something like this:

188
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,525
And I had blocks in the pyramid,

189
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:14,796
and the cornerstones being
industriousness and enthusiasm,

190
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,916
working hard and enjoying
what you're doing,

191
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,796
coming up to the apex,

192
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,796
according to my definition of success.

193
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,153
And right at the top, faith and patience.

194
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,582
And I say to you,
in whatever you're doing,

195
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,766
you must be patient.

196
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,540
You have to have patience to --
we want things to happen.

197
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:35,635
We talk about our youth
being impatient a lot, and they are.

198
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,801
They want to change everything.
They think all change is progress.

199
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,396
And we get a little older --
we sort of let things go.

200
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,031
And we forget there is
no progress without change.

201
00:09:44,055 --> 00:09:45,445
So you must have patience,

202
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,455
and I believe that we must have faith.

203
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,114
I believe that we must
believe, truly believe.

204
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,098
Not just give it word service,

205
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:54,796
believe that things
will work out as they should,

206
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,134
providing we do what we should.

207
00:09:57,158 --> 00:10:01,827
I think our tendency is to hope things
will turn out the way we want them to

208
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,114
much of the time,

209
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:06,477
but we don't do the things
that are necessary

210
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:09,796
to make those things become reality.

211
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,796
I worked on this for some 14 years,

212
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,796
and I think it helped me
become a better teacher.

213
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,974
But it all revolved around that
original definition of success.

214
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,043
You know, a number of years ago,

215
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,796
there was a Major League Baseball
umpire by the name of George Moriarty.

216
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,407
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.

217
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,342
I'd never seen that before, but he did.

218
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:32,183
Big league baseball players --

219
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,278
they're very perceptive
about those things,

220
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,796
and they noticed he had
only one 'i' in his name.

221
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,444
You'd be surprised how many also told him

222
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:42,796
that that was one more
than he had in his head

223
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,977
at various times.

224
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:45,749
(Laughter)

225
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,819
But he wrote something
where I think he did

226
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:49,559
what I tried to do in this pyramid.

227
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,986
He called it "The Road
Ahead, or the Road Behind."

228
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,796
He said, "Sometimes I think the Fates
must grin as we denounce them and insist

229
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,009
the only reason we can't win,
is the Fates themselves have missed.

230
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,796
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:

231
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,549
we win or lose within ourselves.

232
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:06,796
The shining trophies on our shelves
can never win tomorrow's game.

233
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,106
You and I know deeper down, there's
always a chance to win the crown.

234
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,796
But when we fail to give our best,

235
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,899
we simply haven't met the test,
of giving all and saving none

236
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,646
until the game is really won;

237
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,064
of showing what is meant by grit;

238
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,168
of playing through when others quit;

239
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:22,896
of playing through, not letting up.

240
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,659
It's bearing down that wins the cup.

241
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,040
Of dreaming there's a goal ahead;
of hoping when our dreams are dead;

242
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,796
of praying when our hopes have fled;
yet losing, not afraid to fall,

243
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,631
if, bravely, we have given all.

244
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:37,510
For who can ask more of a man
than giving all within his span.

245
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:41,796
Giving all, it seems to me,
is not so far from victory.

246
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,106
And so the Fates are seldom wrong,
no matter how they twist and wind.

247
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,796
It's you and I who make our fates --

248
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,796
we open up or close the gates
on the road ahead or the road behind."

249
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,345
Reminds me of another set of threes
that my dad tried to get across to us:

250
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,462
Don't whine. Don't complain.
Don't make excuses.

251
00:11:58,486 --> 00:11:59,724
Just get out there,

252
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:02,628
and whatever you're doing,
do it to the best of your ability.

253
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,796
And no one can do more than that.

254
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,701
I tried to get across, too, that --

255
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,805
my opponents will tell you --
you never heard me mention winning.

256
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,358
Never mention winning.

257
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:17,960
My idea is that you can lose
when you outscore somebody in a game,

258
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:20,150
and you can win when you're outscored.

259
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:23,796
I've felt that way on certain
occasions, at various times.

260
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,106
And I just wanted them to be able
to hold their head up after a game.

261
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,796
I used to say that when a game is over,

262
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,201
and you see somebody
that didn't know the outcome,

263
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:37,257
I hope they couldn't tell by your actions

264
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:42,796
whether you outscored an opponent
or the opponent outscored you.

265
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,367
That's what really matters:

266
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:48,151
if you make an effort
to do the best you can regularly,

267
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,862
the results will be
about what they should be.

268
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:54,766
Not necessarily what you'd want them to be
but they'll be about what they should;

269
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,796
only you will know
whether you can do that.

270
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,468
And that's what I wanted
from them more than anything else.

271
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:03,270
And as time went by,
and I learned more about other things,

272
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:05,151
I think it worked a little better,

273
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,818
as far as the results.

274
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:11,796
But I wanted the score of a game
to be the byproduct of these other things,

275
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,796
and not the end itself.

276
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,796
I believe it was one great
philosopher who said --

277
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,758
no, no -- Cervantes.

278
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:27,034
Cervantes said, "The journey
is better than the end."

279
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,867
And I like that.

280
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,122
I think that it is --
it's getting there.

281
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,837
Sometimes when you get there,
there's almost a let down.

282
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,885
But it's the getting there that's the fun.

283
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,663
As a basketball coach at UCLA,
I liked our practices to be the journey,

284
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,977
and the game would be
the end, the end result.

285
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:47,159
I liked to go up and sit in the stands
and watch the players play,

286
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:51,796
and see whether I'd done
a decent job during the week.

287
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,403
There again, it's getting the players
to get that self-satisfaction,

288
00:13:55,427 --> 00:14:01,982
in knowing that they'd made the effort
to do the best of which they are capable.

289
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:09,153
Sometimes I'm asked who was
the best player I had, or the best teams.

290
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,796
I can never answer that.

291
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,796
As far as the individuals are concerned --

292
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,796
I was asked one time about that,

293
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,988
and they said,

294
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:23,827
"Suppose that you, in some way,
could make the perfect player.

295
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,011
What would you want?"

296
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:28,011
And I said, "Well, I'd want
one that knew why he was at UCLA:

297
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,796
to get an education,
he was a good student,

298
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,320
really knew why he was there
in the first place.

299
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,210
But I'd want one that could play, too.

300
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:39,399
I'd want one to realize that defense
usually wins championships,

301
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:41,494
and who would work hard on defense.

302
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,796
But I'd want one
who would play offense, too.

303
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,097
I'd want him to be unselfish,

304
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:49,264
and look for the pass first
and not shoot all the time.

305
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,400
And I'd want one
that could pass and would pass.

306
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,621
(Laughter)

307
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,565
I've had some that could and wouldn't,

308
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,691
and I've had some that would and could.

309
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,350
(Laughter)

310
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:00,796
So, yeah, I'd want that.

311
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,597
And I wanted them to be able
to shoot from the outside.

312
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,978
I wanted them to be good inside too.

313
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:08,796
(Laughter)

314
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,796
I'd want them to be able
to rebound well at both ends, too.

315
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,796
Why not just take someone like
Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.

316
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,692
He had the qualifications.

317
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:23,423
Not the only one, but he was one
that I used in that particular category,

318
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,431
because I think he made the effort
to become the best.

319
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,621
There was a couple.

320
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:30,591
I mention in my book,
"They Call Me Coach,"

321
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:32,916
two players that gave
me great satisfaction,

322
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,662
that came as close as I think anyone
I ever had to reach their full potential:

323
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,081
one was Conrad Burke,
and one was Doug McIntosh.

324
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,599
When I saw them as freshmen,
on our freshmen team --

325
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:45,473
freshmen couldn't play
varsity when I taught.

326
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:48,797
I thought, "Oh gracious, if these
two players, either one of them" --

327
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:52,773
they were different years, but I thought
about each one at the time he was there --

328
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,796
"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,

329
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,576
our varsity must be pretty miserable,
if he's good enough to make it."

330
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,531
And you know, one of them was
a starting player for a season and a half.

331
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:09,796
The other one, his next year, played 32
minutes in a national championship game,

332
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,525
Did a tremendous job for us.

333
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,424
The next year, he was a starting player
on the national championship team,

334
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:18,630
and here I thought he'd never
play a minute, when he was --

335
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:23,331
so those are the things
that give you great joy,

336
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,796
and great satisfaction to see.

337
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,796
Neither one of those youngsters
could shoot very well.

338
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,011
But they had outstanding
shooting percentages,

339
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,272
because they didn't force it.

340
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:34,978
And neither one could jump very well,

341
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,422
but they kept good position,
and so they did well rebounding.

342
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:42,130
They remembered that every shot that's
taken, they assumed would be missed.

343
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:45,088
I've had too many stand around
and wait to see if it's missed,

344
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:49,749
then they go and it's too late,
somebody else is in there ahead of them.

345
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,387
They weren't very quick,
but they played good position,

346
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,796
kept in good balance.

347
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,351
And so they played
pretty good defense for us.

348
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,528
So they had qualities that --
they came close to --

349
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,969
as close to reaching
possibly their full potential

350
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:05,262
as any players I ever had.

351
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:11,763
So I consider them to be as successful
as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,

352
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,516
or many of the others that we had;

353
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,279
there were some outstanding players.

354
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,502
Have I rambled enough?

355
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:24,653
I was told that when he makes
his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.

356
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,947
(Laughter)

357
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:29,820
(Applause)
