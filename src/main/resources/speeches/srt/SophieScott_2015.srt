1
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:15,738
Hi. I'm going to talk 
to you today about laughter,

2
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:18,527
and I just want to start 
by thinking about the first time

3
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,556
I can ever remember noticing laughter.

4
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:23,378
This is when I was a little girl.
I would've been about six.

5
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:26,933
And I came across my parents
doing something unusual,

6
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,439
where they were laughing.

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,506
They were laughing very, very hard.

8
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,410
They were lying on the floor laughing.

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,360
They were screaming with laughter.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,587
I did not know what they were 
laughing at, but I wanted in.

11
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,291
I wanted to be part of that,

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,390
and I kind of sat around at the edge
going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,829
Now, incidentally,
what they were laughing at

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,429
was a song which people used to sing,

15
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:53,075
which was based around
signs in toilets on trains

16
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,070
telling you what you could
and could not do

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,510
in toilets on trains.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,713
And the thing you have to remember
about the English is, of course,

19
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:03,436
we do have an immensely
sophisticated sense of humor.

20
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:04,595
(Laughter)

21
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,328
At the time, though, I didn't
understand anything of that.

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,887
I just cared about the laughter,

23
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:12,239
and actually, as a neuroscientist,
I've come to care about it again.

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,996
And it is a really weird thing to do.

25
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,413
What I'm going to do now
is just play some examples

26
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:18,964
of real human beings laughing,

27
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:22,447
and I want you think about the sound
people make and how odd that can be,

28
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:25,024
and in fact how primitive
laughter is as a sound.

29
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,833
It's much more like an animal call
than it is like speech.

30
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,307
So here we've got some laughter for you.
The first one is pretty joyful.

31
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:44,962
(Audio: Laughing)

32
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,901
Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.

33
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,053
There's a point in there
where I'm just, like,

34
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:54,075
you've got to get some air in there, mate,

35
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,280
because he just sounds
like he's breathing out.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,007
(Audio: Laughing)

37
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:08,002
This hasn't been edited; this is him.

38
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:14,364
(Audio: Laughing)
(Laughter)

39
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:18,103
And finally we have -- 
this is a human female laughing.

40
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:22,166
And laughter can take us to some pretty
odd places in terms of making noises.

41
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:30,955
(Audio: Laughing)

42
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:44,433
She actually says, "Oh my God,
what is that?" in French.

43
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,999
We're all kind of with her.
I have no idea.

44
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:51,426
Now, to understand laughter,
you have to look at a part of the body

45
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:55,250
that psychologists and neuroscientists
don't normally spend much time looking at,

46
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,315
which is the ribcage,

47
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,131
and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,

48
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,810
but actually you're all using 
your ribcage all the time.

49
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,393
What you're all doing 
at the moment with your ribcage,

50
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,233
and don't stop doing it, is breathing.

51
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,383
So you use the intercostal muscles,
the muscles between your ribs,

52
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:10,160
to bring air in and out of your lungs

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,350
just by expanding
and contracting your ribcage,

54
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,228
and if I was to put a strap 
around the outside of your chest

55
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,798
called a breath belt, and just look 
at that movement,

56
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,952
you see a rather gentle sinusoidal
movement, so that's breathing.

57
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,530
You're all doing it. Don't stop.

58
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,924
As soon as you start talking,

59
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:26,551
you start using your breathing
completely differently.

60
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,498
So what I'm doing now is you see
something much more like this.

61
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:32,091
In talking, you use very fine
movements of the ribcage

62
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:33,471
to squeeze the air out --

63
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,960
and in fact, we're the only animals
that can do this.

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,501
It's why we can talk at all.

65
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,663
Now, both talking and breathing
has a mortal enemy,

66
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:43,029
and that enemy is laughter,

67
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,478
because what happens when you laugh

68
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:48,779
is those same muscles
start to contract very regularly,

69
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,197
and you get this very marked
sort of zig-zagging,

70
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,380
and that's just squeezing
the air out of you.

71
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,847
It literally is that basic a way
of making a sound.

72
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:58,843
You could be stamping on somebody,
it's having the same effect.

73
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:00,327
You're just squeezing air out,

74
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:03,160
and each of those contractions --
Ha! -- gives you a sound.

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,123
And as the contractions run together,
you can get these spasms,

76
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:09,903
and that's when you start getting
these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.

77
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:13,397
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)

78
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:17,622
Now, in terms of the science of laughter,
there isn't very much,

79
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:20,670
but it does turn out that pretty much
everything we think we know

80
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,862
about laughter is wrong.

81
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,818
So it's not at all unusual, for example,
to hear people to say

82
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,821
humans are the only animals that laugh.

83
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,754
Nietzsche thought that humans
are the only animals that laugh.

84
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,207
In fact, you find laughter
throughout the mammals.

85
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,793
It's been well-described
and well-observed in primates,

86
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,197
but you also see it in rats,

87
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:38,503
and wherever you find it --

88
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,609
humans, primates, rats --

89
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:43,628
you find it associated
with things like tickling.

90
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,716
That's the same for humans.

91
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:51,383
You find it associated with play,
and all mammals play.

92
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:55,377
And wherever you find it,
it's associated with interactions.

93
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:57,967
So Robert Provine, who has done
a lot of work on this,

94
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:02,807
has pointed out that you are 30 times 
more likely to laugh

95
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:06,173
if you are with somebody else
than if you're on your own,

96
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,077
and where you find most laughter

97
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,804
is in social interactions
like conversation.

98
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:13,046
So if you ask human beings,
"When do you laugh?"

99
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,997
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk
about humor and they'll talk about jokes.

100
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:20,196
If you look at when they laugh,
they're laughing with their friends.

101
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,783
And when we laugh with people, we're
hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.

102
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:26,446
You are laughing to show people
that you understand them,

103
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,694
that you agree with them, that you're
part of the same group as them.

104
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,693
You're laughing to show
that you like them.

105
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,898
You might even love them.

106
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,608
You're doing all that at the same time
as talking to them,

107
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,628
and the laughter is doing a lot
of that emotional work for you.

108
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:41,806
Something that Robert Provine
has pointed out, as you can see here,

109
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:43,485
and the reason why we were laughing

110
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,626
when we heard those
funny laughs at the start,

111
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:48,331
and why I was laughing
when I found my parents laughing,

112
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,166
is that it's an enormously
behaviorally contagious effect.

113
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,260
You can catch laughter from somebody else,

114
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,919
and you are more likely to catch laughter
off somebody else if you know them.

115
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,178
So it's still modulated
by this social context.

116
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:00,766
You have to put humor to one side

117
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,987
and think about the social 
meaning of laughter

118
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,075
because that's where its origins lie.

119
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:09,255
Now, something I've got very interested in
is different kinds of laughter,

120
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:13,968
and we have some neurobiological evidence
about how human beings vocalize

121
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:18,101
that suggests there might be
two kinds of laughs that we have.

122
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:23,047
So it seems possible that the neurobiology
for helpless, involuntary laughter,

123
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:26,251
like my parents lying on the floor
screaming about a silly song,

124
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,285
might have a different basis to it
than some of that more polite

125
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,451
social laughter that you encounter,
which isn't horrible laughter,

126
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:36,769
but it's behavior somebody is doing
as part of their communicative act to you,

127
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,870
part of their interaction with you;
they are choosing to do this.

128
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,259
In our evolution, we have developed
two different ways of vocalizing.

129
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,176
Involuntary vocalizations
are part of an older system

130
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:49,379
than the more voluntary vocalizations
like the speech I'm doing now.

131
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,860
So we might imagine that laughter
might actually have two different roots.

132
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,908
So I've been looking at this
in more detail.

133
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:58,131
To do this, we've had to make
recordings of people laughing,

134
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,908
and we've had to do whatever it takes
to make people laugh,

135
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:04,117
and we got those same people
to produce more posed, social laughter.

136
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,785
So imagine your friend told a joke,

137
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,073
and you're laughing because
you like your friend,

138
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,081
but not really because
the joke's all that.

139
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,174
So I'm going to play you 
a couple of those.

140
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:15,327
I want you to tell me if you think
this laughter is real laughter,

141
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:16,626
or if you think it's posed.

142
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:19,562
So is this involuntary laughter
or more voluntary laughter?

143
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:24,442
(Audio: Laughing)

144
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,057
What does that sound like to you?

145
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,130
Audience: Posed.
Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.

146
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,639
How about this one?

147
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,190
(Audio: Laughing)

148
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,622
(Laughter)

149
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,038
I'm the best.

150
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,677
(Laughter) (Applause)

151
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,413
Not really.

152
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,663
No, that was helpless laughter,

153
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,938
and in fact, to record that,
all they had to do was record me

154
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:50,715
watching one of my friends listening to
something I knew she wanted to laugh at,

155
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,185
and I just started doing this.

156
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:55,402
What you find is that people
are good at telling the difference

157
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,947
between real and posed laughter.

158
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,861
They seem to be different things to us.

159
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:01,893
Interestingly, you see something
quite similar with chimpanzees.

160
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,441
Chimpanzees laugh differently
if they're being tickled

161
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,410
than if they're playing with each other,

162
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,672
and we might be seeing
something like that here,

163
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:12,366
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
being different from social laughter.

164
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,107
They're acoustically very different.

165
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,599
The real laughs are longer.
They're higher in pitch.

166
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,018
When you start laughing hard,

167
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,071
you start squeezing air out
from your lungs

168
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:23,262
under much higher pressures
than you could ever produce voluntarily.

169
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:26,184
For example, I could never
pitch my voice that high to sing.

170
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:29,852
Also, you start to get these sort of
contractions and weird whistling sounds,

171
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:32,618
all of which mean that real laughter
is extremely easy,

172
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,690
or feels extremely easy to spot.

173
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,772
In contrast, posed laughter,
we might think it sounds a bit fake.

174
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:42,512
Actually, it's not, it's actually
an important social cue.

175
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:45,589
We use it a lot, we're choosing
to laugh in a lot of situations,

176
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,202
and it seems to be its own thing.

177
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,989
So, for example, you find
nasality in posed laughter,

178
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,096
that kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound

179
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,543
that you never get, you could not do,
if you were laughing involuntarily.

180
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:58,775
So they do seem to be genuinely
these two different sorts of things.

181
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,325
We took it into the scanner
to see how brains respond

182
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,537
when you hear laughter.

183
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,205
And when you do this,
this is a really boring experiment.

184
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,250
We just played people
real and posed laughs.

185
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,454
We didn't tell them
it was a study on laughter.

186
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,653
We put other sounds in there 
to distract them,

187
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,040
and all they're doing
is lying listening to sounds.

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,683
We don't tell them to do anything.

189
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:19,157
Nonetheless, when you hear real laughter
and when you hear posed laughter,

190
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,574
the brains are responding
completely differently,

191
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,006
significantly differently.

192
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:26,554
What you see in the regions in blue,
which lies in auditory cortex,

193
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:29,243
are the brain areas that respond
more to the real laughs,

194
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,684
and what seems to be the case,

195
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,841
when you hear somebody
laughing involuntarily,

196
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,568
you hear sounds you would never
hear in any other context.

197
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:36,654
It's very unambiguous,

198
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:39,724
and it seems to be associated
with greater auditory processing

199
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,094
of these novel sounds.

200
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,903
In contrast, when you hear somebody
laughing in a posed way,

201
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,945
what you see are these regions in pink,

202
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:49,824
which are occupying brain areas
associated with mentalizing,

203
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,979
thinking about what
somebody else is thinking.

204
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:53,519
And I think what that means is,

205
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,716
even if you're having your brain scanned,
which is completely boring

206
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:57,916
and not very interesting,

207
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,249
when you hear somebody going,
"A ha ha ha ha ha,"

208
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,445
you're trying to work out
why they're laughing.

209
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,890
Laughter is always meaningful.

210
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,230
You are always trying
to understand it in context,

211
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,096
even if, as far as you are concerned,
at that point in time,

212
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:11,283
it has not necessarily
anything to do with you,

213
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,955
you still want to know
why those people are laughing.

214
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:17,821
Now, we've had the opportunity to look 
at how people hear real and posed laughter

215
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:18,884
across the age range.

216
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,815
So this is an online experiment
we ran with the Royal Society,

217
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,919
and here we just asked people
two questions.

218
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,747
First of all, they heard some laughs,

219
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:28,766
and they had to say, how real 
or posed do these laughs sound?

220
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:32,223
The real laughs are shown in red
and the posed laughs are shown in blue.

221
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,120
What you see is there is a rapid onset.

222
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,472
As you get older, you get better
and better at spotting real laughter.

223
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,797
So six-year-olds are at chance,
they can't really hear the difference.

224
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,949
By the time you are older, you get better,

225
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:46,571
but interestingly, you do not hit
peak performance in this dataset

226
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:50,102
until you are in your
late 30s and early 40s.

227
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:53,143
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time you hit puberty.

228
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:56,440
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time your brain has matured

229
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,834
at the end of your teens.

230
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,632
You're learning about laughter
throughout your entire early adult life.

231
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:05,434
If we turn the question around and now say
not, what does the laughter sound like

232
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,486
in terms of being real
or posed, but we say,

233
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:09,970
how much does this laughter
make you want to laugh,

234
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,185
how contagious is this laughter to you,
we see a different profile.

235
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,688
And here, the younger you are,

236
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:17,122
the more you want to join in
when you hear laughter.

237
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:20,615
Remember me laughing with my parents
when I had no idea what was going on.

238
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:21,841
You really can see this.

239
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,236
Now everybody, young and old,

240
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:26,081
finds the real laughs more contagious
than the posed laughs,

241
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,991
but as you get older, it all becomes 
less contagious to you.

242
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:33,195
Now, either we're all just becoming
really grumpy as we get older,

243
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:36,124
or it may mean that as you
understand laughter better,

244
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,213
and you are getting better at doing that,

245
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:41,159
you need more than just
hearing people laugh to want to laugh.

246
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,806
You need the social stuff there.

247
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,780
So we've got a very interesting behavior

248
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,933
about which a lot of our
lay assumptions are incorrect,

249
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,784
but I'm coming to see that actually
there's even more to laughter

250
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:55,515
than it's an important social emotion
we should look at,

251
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,434
because it turns out
people are phenomenally nuanced

252
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,021
in terms of how we use laughter.

253
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,305
There's a really lovely
set of studies coming out

254
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,399
from Robert Levenson's lab in California,

255
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,875
where he's doing
a longitudinal study with couples.

256
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,658
He gets married couples,
men and women, into the lab,

257
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,952
and he gives them
stressful conversations to have

258
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:15,484
while he wires them up to a polygraph
so he can see them becoming stressed.

259
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,719
So you've got the two of them in there,
and he'll say to the husband,

260
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,501
"Tell me something that your wife does
that irritates you."

261
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,117
And what you see is immediately --

262
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,444
just run that one through your head
briefly, you and your partner --

263
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:30,592
you can imagine everybody gets a bit
more stressed as soon as that starts.

264
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,216
You can see physically,
people become more stressed.

265
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:38,998
What he finds is that the couples
who manage that feeling of stress

266
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:42,504
with laughter,
positive emotions like laughter,

267
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:46,312
not only immediately become less stressed,

268
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,726
they can see them
physically feeling better,

269
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,884
they're dealing with this
unpleasant situation better together,

270
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,705
they are also the couples that report

271
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,064
high levels of satisfaction
in their relationship

272
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,735
and they stay together for longer.

273
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,056
So in fact, when you look
at close relationships,

274
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,954
laughter is a phenomenally useful index

275
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,427
of how people are regulating
their emotions together.

276
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,852
We're not just emitting it at each other
to show that we like each other,

277
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,907
we're making ourselves
feel better together.

278
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:13,358
Now, I don't think this is going
to be limited to romantic relationships.

279
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,831
I think this is probably
going to be a characteristic

280
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,149
of close emotional relationships
such as you might have with friends,

281
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,978
which explains my next clip,

282
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:24,623
which is of a YouTube video of some
young men in the former East Germany

283
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:28,129
on making a video to promote
their heavy metal band,

284
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:31,031
and it's extremely macho,
and the mood is very serious,

285
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,143
and I want you to notice
what happens in terms of laughter

286
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,093
when things go wrong

287
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:39,945
and how quickly that happens,
and how that changes the mood.

288
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,731
He's cold. He's about to get wet.
He's got swimming trunks on,

289
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:48,469
got a towel.

290
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,141
Ice.

291
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:52,579
What might possibly happen?

292
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:55,992
Video starts.

293
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,382
Serious mood.

294
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:11,069
And his friends are already laughing.
They are already laughing, hard.

295
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:12,973
He's not laughing yet.

296
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,332
(Laughter)

297
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,543
He's starting to go now.

298
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,338
And now they're all off.

299
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:32,376
(Laughter)

300
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:46,215
They're on the floor.

301
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:49,837
(Laughter)

302
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:58,859
The thing I really like about that
is it's all very serious

303
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:02,584
until he jumps onto the ice, and
as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,

304
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:04,847
but also there isn't blood
and bone everywhere,

305
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,420
his friends start laughing.

306
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,812
And imagine if that had played him out
with him standing there going,

307
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:12,256
"No seriously, Heinrich,
I think this is broken,"

308
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:15,006
we wouldn't enjoy watching that.
That would be stressful.

309
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,999
Or if he was running around
with a visibly broken leg laughing,

310
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,830
and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I
think we need to go to the hospital now,"

311
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,227
that also wouldn't be funny.

312
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:24,889
The fact that the laughter works,

313
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,851
it gets him from a painful,
embarrassing, difficult situation,

314
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:30,936
into a funny situation, into what we're 
actually enjoying there,

315
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:33,123
and I think that's 
a really interesting use,

316
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,101
and it's actually happening all the time.

317
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,792
For example, I can remember
something like this happening

318
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:38,989
at my father's funeral.

319
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,604
We weren't jumping around
on the ice in our underpants.

320
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:44,245
We're not Canadian.

321
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,700
(Laughter) (Applause)

322
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:50,627
These events are always difficult, I had
a relative who was being a bit difficult,

323
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,157
my mum was not in a good place,

324
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:55,441
and I can remember finding myself
just before the whole thing started

325
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:59,688
telling this story about something
that happened in a 1970s sitcom,

326
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,126
and I just thought at the time,
I don't know why I'm doing this,

327
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,304
and what I realized I was doing

328
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:07,002
was I was coming up with
something from somewhere

329
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:11,391
I could use to make her laugh
together with me.

330
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,704
It was a very basic reaction
to find some reason we can do this.

331
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:17,389
We can laugh together.
We're going to get through this.

332
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:18,885
We're going to be okay.

333
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,316
And in fact, all of us
are doing this all the time.

334
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,506
You do it so often,
you don't even notice it.

335
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,921
Everybody underestimates
how often they laugh,

336
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,939
and you're doing something,
when you laugh with people,

337
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,769
that's actually letting you access
a really ancient evolutionary system

338
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:37,576
that mammals have evolved
to make and maintain social bonds,

339
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,966
and clearly to regulate emotions,
to make ourselves feel better.

340
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,356
It's not something specific to humans --
it's a really ancient behavior

341
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:48,420
which really helps us regulate how we feel
and makes us feel better.

342
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,322
In other words, when it comes to laughter,

343
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:53,992
you and me, baby, ain't nothing 
but mammals. (Laughter)

344
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,337
Thank you.

345
00:16:56,337 --> 00:17:03,583
Thank you. (Applause)
