1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
On September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
and my father was reading the paper or something,

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,820
"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
And my father smiled and said,

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
"Well, you know what that means, don't you?"

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,820
and get a lot of presents?" And my dad said, "Well, yes.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,820
But, more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason,

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,820
and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
(Laughter)

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Now, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
my second-grade class at school. But when she said it,

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
for our first communion and our first confession,

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil,

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,820
and anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, "age of reason."

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
And my dad said, "Well, we believe in the Catholic Church

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong,

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,820
So, you've grown up, and reached the age of reason, and now

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,820
God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record."

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
(Laughter)

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,820
And I said, "Oh. Wait a minute. You mean all that time,

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,820
up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
(Laughter)

31
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
All that being good and no real credit for it.

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
And, worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,820
until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her.

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus."

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
(Laughter)

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me.

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve,

47
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
like he did for every other family

48
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning,

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
our family would give Santa more time.

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Which made me very suspicious.

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.

54
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,820
and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.

56
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back

57
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?

58
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,820
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
our family was too strange and weird

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
for even Santa Claus to come visit,

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,820
this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly --

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
but, let's face it, he was also very judgmental.

64
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,820
So, to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.

65
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,

66
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
but rather I was just dumbfounded

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.

68
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,

69
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
someone who could use the information.

70
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
They had to fit two criteria:

71
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
they had to be old enough to be able to understand

72
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.

73
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.

74
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house

75
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
at this public school playground. It was a Saturday,

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.

77
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!

78
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,

79
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
and then you're capable of committing any and all sins

80
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,820
against God and man." And Bill said, "So?" And then I said,

81
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,820
"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to

82
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
and God won't notice it." And he said, "So?" And I said,

83
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,820
"So? So everything!" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.

84
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically

85
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,820
and said, "Oh, by the way, Bill, there is no Santa Claus."

86
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
(Laughter)

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Now, I didn't know it at the time,

88
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10.

89
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,820
For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,

90
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,

91
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,820
"I need to speak to you privately.

92
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,820
September 10 is not your birthday. It's October 10." And I said, "What?"

93
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
(Laughter)

94
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:19,820
And she said, "Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15."

95
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
(Laughter)

96
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
"So, I told them that your birthday was on September 10,

97
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,820
and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,820
so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10.

99
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,820
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."

100
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
I thought about it, and when I was four,

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
I was already the oldest of four children,

102
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
and my mother even had another child to come,

103
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready,

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
she was so ready. Then she said,

105
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
"Don't worry, Julie, every year on October 10 when it was your birthday

106
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
but you didn't realize it, I made sure

107
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
that you ate a piece of cake that day."

108
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
(Laughter)

109
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Which was comforting, but troubling.

110
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,820
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.

111
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information

112
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
with all of my girlfriends,

114
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,820
what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo.

115
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom,

116
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
and I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
(Laughter)

118
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
And this meant that I was a Libra?

119
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,820
So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,

121
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
sort of lounging by some water,

122
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.

123
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
This was around the time that I started filling out physically,

124
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,

125
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,820
and, frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale

126
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
just seemed ominous and depressing.

127
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
(Laughter)

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
But I got the new Libra poster,

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
and I started to read my new Libra horoscope,

130
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,820
and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.

131
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
It wasn't until years later, looking back

132
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing,

133
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven

134
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month

135
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,820
to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.

136
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh, life can be so cruel.

137
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.

138
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,

139
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning

140
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
for people who are peddling things door to door.

141
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church

142
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.

143
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,820
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang

144
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
and just start robbing people if I only buy

145
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
some magazine subscriptions from them.

146
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,820
So, normally I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day I answered.

147
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And there stood two boys, each about 19,

148
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,820
in white starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags

149
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
that identified them as official representatives

150
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,

151
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
and they said they had a message for me from God.

152
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."

153
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,

154
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,

155
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
I've worked with them and even dated them,

156
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people

157
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was, sort of, curious,

158
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
so I said, "Well, please, come in." And they looked really happy,

159
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
because I don't think this happens to them all that often.

160
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
(Laughter)

161
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water --

162
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
OK, I got it. I got them glasses of water.

163
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.

164
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
(Laughter)

165
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
You can't put a video of myself in front of me

166
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
and expect me not to fix my hair.

167
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
(Laughter)

168
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,820
OK. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,

169
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,820
and after niceties they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"

170
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,820
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,

171
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
but, you know, I don't like that word, heart,

172
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
because it anthropomorphizes God,

173
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,820
and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."

174
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,

175
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said

176
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,820
"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."

177
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
And they looked at each other and smiled,

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
like that was the right answer. And then they said,

179
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
"Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"

180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
And I said, "Yes, I do. Yes, I do." And I was so relieved

181
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
that it was a question I could answer so quickly.

182
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
And they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."

183
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,

184
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.

185
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,

186
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them:

187
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
man, woman, child, infant, fetus.

188
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
And God came to Lehi and said to him, "Put your family on a boat

189
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
and I will lead you out of here." And God did lead them.

190
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
He led them to America.

191
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I said, "America? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"

192
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And they said, "Yes."

193
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
(Laughter)

194
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants

195
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years

196
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,

197
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and the Nephites were totally, totally good -- each and every one of them --

198
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --

199
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
every single one of them just bad to the bone.

200
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
(Laughter)

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,

202
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,820
on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.

203
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
(Laughter)

204
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good --

205
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
each and every one of them --

206
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.

207
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
But apparently somebody blew it,

208
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.

209
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,

210
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.

211
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
And he made sure this whole story was written down

212
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,

213
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.

214
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,820
(Laughter)

215
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.

216
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
(Laughter)

217
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"

218
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
And they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans here in the U.S."

219
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,820
And I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended

220
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
from a people who were totally evil?" And they said, "Yes."

221
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith

222
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,820
found those buried gold plates right in his backyard,

223
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat

224
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
and then buried his face into, and this allowed him

225
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.

226
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys

227
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
some advice about their pitch.

228
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
(Laughter)

229
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I wanted to say, "OK, don't start with this story."

230
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,820
I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --

231
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
(Applause)

232
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,820
-- telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.

233
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Well, then they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us

234
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
through his righteous prophets?" And I said, "No, I don't."

235
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Because I was, sort of, upset about this Lamanite story

236
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was,

237
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said,

238
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
"Well, what exactly do you mean by righteous?

239
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"

240
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?" And they said,

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,820
"Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular,

242
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,820
it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men

243
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
was the gift of prophecy."

244
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?

245
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?

246
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be

247
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
much less violent than men? But, no, it wasn't any of these gifts.

248
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."

249
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I said, "Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby

250
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,820
every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,

251
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
assuming they didn't die from exhaustion,

252
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
it still seems like some women would have some time left over

253
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,820
to hear the word of God." And they said, "No."

254
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
(Laughter)

255
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,

256
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
but they had more to say.

257
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon

258
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die

259
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,820
you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity."

260
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
And I said, "Oh, dear --

261
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,820
(Laughter)

262
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
-- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."

263
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
(Laughter)

264
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,820
And they said, "Oh -- hey, well, we also believe

265
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
that when you go to heaven you get your body restored

266
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
to you in its best original state.

267
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.

268
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."

269
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,820
I said, "Oh -- now, I don't have a uterus because I had cancer

270
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
a few years ago. So, does this mean that if I went to heaven

271
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,820
I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."

272
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,820
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.

273
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?

274
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
(Laughter)

275
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Would God force you to get your old nose back?

276
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Well, then they gave me this Book of Mormon,

277
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter,

278
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me,

279
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
and I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry,"

280
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,820
or maybe it was just, "Please don't," and they were gone.

281
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
OK, so, I initially felt really superior to these boys,

282
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
and smug in my more conventional faith. But then,

283
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.

284
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology

285
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
and dogma for the very first time, and they said,

286
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl

287
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
without the use of intercourse,

288
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us --

289
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
(Laughter)

290
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,820
-- and she had a baby, and that's the son of God,"

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.

292
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
I'm just so used to that story.

293
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
(Laughter)

294
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.

295
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
But the question they asked me when they first arrived

296
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
really stuck in my head:

297
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart?

298
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.

299
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Now, if they'd asked me,

300
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?

301
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,

302
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,820
"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused,

303
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,820
and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love

304
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
when I don't understand why tragedy hits,

305
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,820
and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."

306
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it,

307
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
somehow it was all different,

308
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,820
because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
