1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
They've been here for billions of years,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
So they are one cell and they have this special property

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
that they only have one piece of DNA.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
They have very few genes,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,820
and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
And the way bacteria make a living

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
is that they consume nutrients from the environment,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
they grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,820
They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
except that what I would argue is that you have

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
an amazing interaction with these critters.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
This man is supposed to represent

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
a generic human being,

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
who we are and able to do all the things that we do,

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
in you or on you at any moment in your life.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
So, 10 times more bacterial cells

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
than human cells on a human being.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
And of course it's the DNA that counts,

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.

28
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
You have about 30,000 genes.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,820
playing a role in you or on you all of your life.

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
At the best, you're 10 percent human,

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
but more likely about one percent human,

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
depending on which of these metrics you like.

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
I know you think of yourself as human beings,

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,820
but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,820
(Laughter)

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
These bacteria are not passive riders,

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
these are incredibly important, they keep us alive.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
They cover us in an invisible body armor

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
that keeps environmental insults out

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
so that we stay healthy.

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
They digest our food, they make our vitamins,

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
they actually educate your immune system

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
to keep bad microbes out.

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
So they do all these amazing things

46
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
that help us and are vital for keeping us alive,

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and they never get any press for that.

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
terrible things as well.

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
So, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth

51
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
that have no business being in you or on you at any time,

52
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,820
and if they are, they make you incredibly sick.

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
And so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,820
good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
The question we had is how could they do anything at all?

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
I mean they're incredibly small,

57
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
you have to have a microscope to see one.

58
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,820
and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
on the environment

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
if they simply act as individuals.

63
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
way that bacteria live.

65
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium,

66
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.

67
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,

70
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
named Vibrio fischeri.

71
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light,

72
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
so it makes bioluminescence,

73
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
like fireflies make light.

74
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
We're not doing anything to the cells here.

75
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,

76
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
and this is what we see.

77
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
What was actually interesting to us

78
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
was not that the bacteria made light,

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
but when the bacteria made light.

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
so when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.

82
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
But when they grew to a certain cell number

83
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,820
all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.

84
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
The question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,

85
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
tell the difference from times when they're alone,

86
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
and times when they're in a community,

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
and then all do something together.

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,820
What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
and they talk with a chemical language.

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
When it's alone it doesn't make any light.

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules

93
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
that you can think of like hormones,

94
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone

95
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,820
the molecules just float away and so no light.

96
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
But when the bacteria grow and double

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
and they're all participating in making these molecules,

98
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule

99
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
increases in proportion to cell number.

100
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
And when the molecule hits a certain amount

101
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,

102
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
they recognize that molecule

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.

104
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
That's how bioluminescence works --

105
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
they're talking with these chemical words.

106
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,820
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.

107
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean,

108
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.

109
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,

110
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
and it's been turned on its back,

111
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes

112
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,

113
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
they live in there, at high cell number

114
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
that molecule is there, and they're making light.

115
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans

116
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
is because it wants that light.

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
The way that this symbiosis works

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.

120
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
The squid is nocturnal, so during the day

121
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
it buries itself in the sand and sleeps,

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
but then at night it has to come out to hunt.

123
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight

124
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
that light can penetrate the depth of the water

125
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.

126
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
What the squid has developed is a shutter

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,820
that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Then it has detectors on its back

129
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,820
so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.

130
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
And it opens and closes the shutter

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
so the amount of light coming out of the bottom --

132
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
which is made by the bacterium --

133
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
so the squid doesn't make a shadow.

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
It actually uses the light from the bacteria

136
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device

137
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
so predators can't see its shadow,

138
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
calculate its trajectory, and eat it.

139
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.

140
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
(Laughter)

141
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem

142
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria

143
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
and it can't sustain that.

144
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up

145
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,

146
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,

147
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,820
and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.

148
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,

149
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
so they're not making light --

150
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.

151
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
And as the day goes by the bacteria double,

152
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
they release the molecule, and then light comes on

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
at night, exactly when the squid wants it.

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
First we figured out how this bacterium does this,

155
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this

156
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
to figure out really what's the mechanism.

157
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell --

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein --

159
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
that's the red box -- it's an enzyme that makes

160
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
that little hormone molecule, the red triangle.

161
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
And then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule

162
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.

163
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,820
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface

164
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.

165
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.

166
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
When the molecule increases to a certain amount --

167
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
which says something about the number of cells --

168
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
it locks down into that receptor

169
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and information comes into the cells

170
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
that tells the cells to turn on

171
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
this collective behavior of making light.

172
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade

173
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
we have found that this is not just some anomaly

174
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --

175
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
all bacteria have systems like this.

176
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.

177
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
They make chemical words, they recognize those words,

178
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
and they turn on group behaviors

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,820
that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.

180
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
We have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.

181
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
They vote with these chemical votes,

182
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.

183
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
What's important for today's talk

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors

185
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.

186
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.

187
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you

188
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
and they start secreting some toxins --

189
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.

190
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
What they do, we now understand,

191
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
they count themselves with these little molecules,

193
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
and they recognize when they have the right cell number

194
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,820
that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,

195
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.

196
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.

197
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
That's how it works.

198
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
We also then went to look at what are these molecules --

199
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
these were the red triangles on my slides before.

200
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.

201
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
This is the word that it talks with.

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
So then we started to look at other bacteria,

203
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.

204
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
What I hope you can see

205
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
is that the molecules are related.

206
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical

207
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
in every single species of bacteria.

208
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,820
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.

209
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
What that does is to confer

210
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,820
exquisite species specificities to these languages.

211
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.

212
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
So these are private, secret conversations.

213
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820
These conversations are for intraspecies communication.

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language

215
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
that allows it to count its own siblings.

216
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Once we got that far we thought

217
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.

218
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time

219
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,820
with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.

221
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.

222
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.

223
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,

224
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,820
and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.

225
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,820
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,

226
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
and it's about counting your neighbors,

227
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
There has to be a way to take a census

229
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
of the rest of the bacteria in the population.

230
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
So we went back to molecular biology

231
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
and started studying different bacteria,

232
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and what we've found now is that

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
in fact, bacteria are multilingual.

234
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
They all have a species-specific system --

235
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
they have a molecule that says "me."

236
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
But then, running in parallel to that is a second system

237
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
that we've discovered, that's generic.

238
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal

239
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
and it has its own receptor,

240
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.

241
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
It's used by all different bacteria

242
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,820
and it's the language of interspecies communication.

243
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
What happens is that bacteria are able to count

244
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
how many of me and how many of you.

245
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
They take that information inside,

246
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
and they decide what tasks to carry out

247
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority

248
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
of any given population.

249
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Then again we turn to chemistry,

250
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
and we figured out what this generic molecule is --

251
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.

252
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.

253
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
What the important thing is that we learned

254
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme

255
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
and makes exactly the same molecule.

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
So they're all using this molecule

257
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
for interspecies communication.

258
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
This is the bacterial Esperanto.

259
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
(Laughter)

260
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Once we got that far, we started to learn

261
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.

262
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something

263
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
practical that we can do here as well.

264
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,

265
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
they communicate with these molecules.

266
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do

267
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.

268
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
We thought, what if we made these bacteria

269
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
so they can't talk or they can't hear?

270
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?

271
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Of course, you've just heard and you already know

272
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
that we're running out of antibiotics.

273
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,

274
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.

275
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
They either pop the bacterial membrane,

276
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.

277
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics

278
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
and that selects for resistant mutants.

279
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
And so now of course we have this global problem

280
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
in infectious diseases.

281
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,

282
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,

283
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
and they don't know to launch virulence.

284
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
And so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.

285
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
The first one is we've targeted

286
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
the intraspecies communication system.

287
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules --

288
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
which you saw -- but they're a little bit different.

289
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
And so they lock into those receptors,

290
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
and they jam recognition of the real thing.

291
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
By targeting the red system,

292
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
what we are able to do is to make

293
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,820
species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.

294
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.

295
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit

296
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
so that we've made antagonists

297
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
of the interspecies communication system.

298
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,820
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics

299
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
that work against all bacteria.

300
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.

301
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,

302
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
but the logic is exactly the same.

303
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,

304
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
in this case, a mouse,

305
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.

306
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting

307
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
its quorum sensing molecules.

308
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria

309
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
that now they're going to launch their attack,

310
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
and the animal dies.

311
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,

312
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,820
but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules --

313
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,

314
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.

315
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
What we now know is that if we treat the animal

316
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,820
with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --

317
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,820
in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,

318
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
in fact, the animal lives.

319
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,820
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics

320
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
and it's going to get us around, at least initially,

321
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
this big problem of resistance.

322
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,

323
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
they use chemicals as their words,

324
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon

325
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
that we're just now starting to learn about.

326
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Of course what that allows bacteria to do

327
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
is to be multicellular.

328
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together

329
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
because it makes a difference.

330
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,820
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,

331
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
and they can carry out tasks

332
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
that they could never accomplish

333
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
if they simply acted as individuals.

334
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
What I would hope that I could further argue to you

335
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
is that this is the invention of multicellularity.

336
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;

337
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
humans, couple hundred thousand.

338
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
We think bacteria made the rules

339
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
for how multicellular organization works.

340
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
We think, by studying bacteria,

341
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,820
we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.

342
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
We know that the principles and the rules,

343
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,

344
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
the hope is that they will be applied

345
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,820
to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.

346
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I hope that what you've learned

347
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.

348
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
By using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."

349
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Again of course that's what we do,

350
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
both in a molecular way,

351
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
and also in an outward way,

352
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
but I think about the molecular stuff.

353
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
This is exactly what happens in your body.

354
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,

355
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,

356
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,

357
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
and what their tasks should be.

358
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
Again, we think that bacteria invented that,

359
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,

360
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.

361
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,820
The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,

362
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules

363
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.

364
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria

365
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
that live on the Earth,

366
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.

367
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.

368
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells

369
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
in you or on you, keeping you healthy.

370
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation

371
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,820
of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,

372
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
in the hopes of making you more healthy,

373
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
making those conversations better,

374
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
so bacteria can do things that we want them to do

375
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
better than they would be on their own.

376
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Finally, I wanted to show you

377
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.

378
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.

379
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
I hope when you learn things,

380
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
like about how the natural world works --

381
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper

382
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world

383
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
it was done by a child.

384
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Science is done by that demographic.

385
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,

386
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.

387
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
It's a really lucky demographic to work with.

388
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age,

389
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
and it's just a crazy delightful job.

390
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I want to thank you for inviting me here.

391
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.

392
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,820
(Applause)

393
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
Thanks.

394
00:17:51,820 --> 00:18:05,820
(Applause)
