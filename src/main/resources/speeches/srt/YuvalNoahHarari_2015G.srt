1
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:18,194
70,000 years ago, our ancestors
were insignificant animals.

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:22,317
The most important thing to know
about prehistoric humans

3
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,293
is that they were unimportant.

4
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:29,451
Their impact on the world was not
much greater than that of jellyfish

5
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,836
or fireflies or woodpeckers.

6
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:36,046
Today, in contrast,
we control this planet.

7
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:38,015
And the question is:

8
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,161
How did we come from there to here?

9
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:45,138
How did we turn ourselves
from insignificant apes,

10
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,309
minding their own business
in a corner of Africa,

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,823
into the rulers of planet Earth?

12
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:57,386
Usually, we look for the difference
between us and all the other animals

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,891
on the individual level.

14
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:02,226
We want to believe -- I want to believe --

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,798
that there is something special about me,

16
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:08,948
about my body, about my brain,

17
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:14,255
that makes me so superior
to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,302
But the truth is that,
on the individual level,

19
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:21,357
I'm embarrassingly similar
to a chimpanzee.

20
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:27,084
And if you take me and a chimpanzee
and put us together on some lonely island,

21
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:31,356
and we had to struggle for survival
to see who survives better,

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,596
I would definitely place my bet
on the chimpanzee, not on myself.

23
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,265
And this is not something
wrong with me personally.

24
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:44,415
I guess if they took almost any one
of you, and placed you alone

25
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,404
with a chimpanzee on some island,

26
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:48,895
the chimpanzee would do much better.

27
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,828
The real difference between humans
and all other animals

28
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:57,299
is not on the individual level;

29
00:01:57,323 --> 00:01:58,925
it's on the collective level.

30
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:04,144
Humans control the planet
because they are the only animals

31
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:09,345
that can cooperate both flexibly
and in very large numbers.

32
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,755
Now, there are other animals --

33
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:14,950
like the social insects,
the bees, the ants --

34
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:19,546
that can cooperate in large numbers,
but they don't do so flexibly.

35
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,356
Their cooperation is very rigid.

36
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:27,011
There is basically just one way
in which a beehive can function.

37
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:30,846
And if there's a new opportunity
or a new danger,

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,413
the bees cannot reinvent
the social system overnight.

39
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:38,317
They cannot, for example,
execute the queen

40
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,247
and establish a republic of bees,

41
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:43,373
or a communist dictatorship
of worker bees.

42
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,605
Other animals, like the social mammals --

43
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,503
the wolves, the elephants,
the dolphins, the chimpanzees --

44
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:53,273
they can cooperate much more flexibly,

45
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:56,638
but they do so only in small numbers,

46
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,535
because cooperation among chimpanzees

47
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:03,607
is based on intimate knowledge,
one of the other.

48
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:06,399
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,

49
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,226
and I want to cooperate with you.

50
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,845
I need to know you personally.

51
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:12,639
What kind of chimpanzee are you?

52
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,076
Are you a nice chimpanzee?

53
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,753
Are you an evil chimpanzee?

54
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,221
Are you trustworthy?

55
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:20,298
If I don't know you, how can I
cooperate with you?

56
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:25,247
The only animal that can combine
the two abilities together

57
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:30,567
and cooperate both flexibly
and still do so in very large numbers

58
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,221
is us, Homo sapiens.

59
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:36,924
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,

60
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:39,517
chimpanzees might be better than us.

61
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:45,111
But, if you pit 1,000 humans
against 1,000 chimpanzees,

62
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:48,753
the humans will win easily,
for the simple reason

63
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:52,510
that a thousand chimpanzees
cannot cooperate at all.

64
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:57,208
And if you now try to cram
100,000 chimpanzees

65
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:00,848
into Oxford Street,
or into Wembley Stadium,

66
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:03,404
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,

67
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:06,045
you will get chaos, complete chaos.

68
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,928
Just imagine Wembley Stadium
with 100,000 chimpanzees.

69
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,626
Complete madness.

70
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,981
In contrast, humans normally
gather there in tens of thousands,

71
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,069
and what we get is not chaos, usually.

72
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:27,180
What we get is extremely sophisticated
and effective networks of cooperation.

73
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:32,964
All the huge achievements
of humankind throughout history,

74
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:36,271
whether it's building the pyramids
or flying to the moon,

75
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:38,870
have been based not
on individual abilities,

76
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:42,719
but on this ability to cooperate
flexibly in large numbers.

77
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,942
Think even about this very talk
that I'm giving now:

78
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:52,950
I'm standing here in front of an audience
of about 300 or 400 people,

79
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:56,098
most of you are complete strangers to me.

80
00:04:56,748 --> 00:05:01,732
Similarly, I don't really know
all the people who have organized

81
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,383
and worked on this event.

82
00:05:03,814 --> 00:05:07,607
I don't know the pilot
and the crew members of the plane

83
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,542
that brought me over here,
yesterday, to London.

84
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:14,829
I don't know the people
who invented and manufactured

85
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:19,363
this microphone and these cameras,
which are recording what I'm saying.

86
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:23,480
I don't know the people
who wrote all the books and articles

87
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,897
that I read in preparation for this talk.

88
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,125
And I certainly don't know all the people

89
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,368
who might be watching this talk
over the Internet,

90
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:35,419
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.

91
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:39,491
Nevertheless, even though
we don't know each other,

92
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:45,368
we can work together to create
this global exchange of ideas.

93
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:48,952
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.

94
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,790
They communicate, of course,

95
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:56,613
but you will never catch a chimpanzee
traveling to some distant chimpanzee band

96
00:05:56,637 --> 00:06:00,757
to give them a talk about bananas
or about elephants,

97
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,789
or anything else that might
interest chimpanzees.

98
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,699
Now cooperation is, of course,
not always nice;

99
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:12,748
all the horrible things humans
have been doing throughout history --

100
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,511
and we have been doing
some very horrible things --

101
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:20,684
all those things are also based
on large-scale cooperation.

102
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,304
Prisons are a system of cooperation;

103
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:26,318
slaughterhouses are a system
of cooperation;

104
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:29,346
concentration camps
are a system of cooperation.

105
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:34,907
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses
and prisons and concentration camps.

106
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:39,833
Now suppose I've managed
to convince you perhaps that yes,

107
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,915
we control the world because we can
cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

108
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:48,284
The next question that immediately arises

109
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,191
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:

110
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,499
How, exactly, do we do it?

111
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:59,685
What enables us alone, of all the animals,
to cooperate in such a way?

112
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,080
The answer is our imagination.

113
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:10,250
We can cooperate flexibly
with countless numbers of strangers,

114
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,970
because we alone, of all
the animals on the planet,

115
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:18,617
can create and believe fictions,
fictional stories.

116
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:23,734
And as long as everybody believes
in the same fiction,

117
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:27,300
everybody obeys and follows
the same rules,

118
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,613
the same norms, the same values.

119
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:34,358
All other animals use
their communication system

120
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:36,878
only to describe reality.

121
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,627
A chimpanzee may say, "Look!
There's a lion, let's run away!"

122
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:45,757
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree
over there! Let's go and get bananas!"

123
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:52,058
Humans, in contrast, use their language
not merely to describe reality,

124
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:56,606
but also to create new realities,
fictional realities.

125
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:01,052
A human can say, "Look,
there is a god above the clouds!

126
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,156
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,

127
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,385
when you die, God will punish you
and send you to hell."

128
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:10,578
And if you all believe this story
that I've invented,

129
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:14,417
then you will follow the same
norms and laws and values,

130
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,733
and you can cooperate.

131
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,448
This is something only humans can do.

132
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:22,868
You can never convince a chimpanzee
to give you a banana

133
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:26,685
by promising him, "... after you die,
you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."

134
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,732
(Laughter)

135
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:31,018
"... and you'll receive lots and lots
of bananas for your good deeds.

136
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,464
So now give me this banana."

137
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:35,246
No chimpanzee will ever
believe such a story.

138
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,286
Only humans believe such stories,

139
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,393
which is why we control the world,

140
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:45,262
whereas the chimpanzees are locked up
in zoos and research laboratories.

141
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,664
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,

142
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:55,828
in the religious field, humans cooperate
by believing in the same fictions.

143
00:08:55,852 --> 00:09:00,804
Millions of people come together
to build a cathedral or a mosque

144
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:06,570
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because
they all believe in the same stories

145
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,307
about God and heaven and hell.

146
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:15,038
But what I want to emphasize
is that exactly the same mechanism

147
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:20,926
underlies all other forms
of mass-scale human cooperation,

148
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,470
not only in the religious field.

149
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,772
Take, for example, the legal field.

150
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:32,328
Most legal systems today in the world
are based on a belief in human rights.

151
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,844
But what are human rights?

152
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:40,118
Human rights, just like God and heaven,
are just a story that we've invented.

153
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:42,460
They are not an objective reality;

154
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:46,150
they are not some biological effect
about homo sapiens.

155
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,338
Take a human being,
cut him open, look inside,

156
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:55,489
you will find the heart, the kidneys,
neurons, hormones, DNA,

157
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:57,401
but you won't find any rights.

158
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,941
The only place you find rights
are in the stories

159
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:06,098
that we have invented and spread around
over the last few centuries.

160
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:11,357
They may be very positive stories,
very good stories,

161
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,944
but they're still just fictional stories
that we've invented.

162
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,004
The same is true of the political field.

163
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:24,755
The most important factors
in modern politics are states and nations.

164
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,953
But what are states and nations?

165
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,538
They are not an objective reality.

166
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,275
A mountain is an objective reality.

167
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,583
You can see it, you can touch it,
you can ever smell it.

168
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,815
But a nation or a state,

169
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,619
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,

170
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:44,383
this is just a story that we've invented

171
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,381
and became extremely attached to.

172
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,273
The same is true of the economic field.

173
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:53,418
The most important actors today
in the global economy

174
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,704
are companies and corporations.

175
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:59,958
Many of you today, perhaps, work
for a corporation,

176
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:03,032
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.

177
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,215
What exactly are these things?

178
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:09,749
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.

179
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,655
They are stories invented and maintained

180
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,012
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.

181
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,481
(Laughter)

182
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,924
And what do corporations do all day?

183
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,801
Mostly, they try to make money.

184
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,564
Yet, what is money?

185
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:31,754
Again, money is not an objective reality;
it has no objective value.

186
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,095
Take this green piece
of paper, the dollar bill.

187
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,496
Look at it -- it has no value.

188
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,754
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,

189
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,070
you cannot wear it.

190
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:45,494
But then came along
these master storytellers --

191
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,002
the big bankers,

192
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,466
the finance ministers,

193
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,844
the prime ministers --

194
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,346
and they tell us a very convincing story:

195
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,328
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?

196
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,935
It is actually worth 10 bananas."

197
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,520
And if I believe it, and you believe it,

198
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,060
and everybody believes it,

199
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,948
it actually works.

200
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,885
I can take this worthless piece of paper,

201
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,546
go to the supermarket,

202
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,577
give it to a complete stranger
whom I've never met before,

203
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:16,286
and get, in exchange, real bananas
which I can actually eat.

204
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,411
This is something amazing.

205
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,513
You could never do it with chimpanzees.

206
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,482
Chimpanzees trade, of course:

207
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:25,256
"Yes, you give me a coconut,
I'll give you a banana."

208
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,518
That can work.

209
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,534
But, you give me
a worthless piece of paper

210
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,572
and you except me to give you a banana?

211
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:32,748
No way!

212
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,353
What do you think I am, a human?

213
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,750
(Laughter)

214
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:40,893
Money, in fact, is
the most successful story

215
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,573
ever invented and told by humans,

216
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,940
because it is the only story
everybody believes.

217
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:51,302
Not everybody believes in God,

218
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,351
not everybody believes in human rights,

219
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,160
not everybody believes in nationalism,

220
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,927
but everybody believes in money,
and in the dollar bill.

221
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:03,315
Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.

222
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,026
He hated American politics
and American religion

223
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,499
and American culture,

224
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,329
but he had no objection
to American dollars.

225
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:13,448
He was quite fond of them, actually.

226
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:15,375
(Laughter)

227
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,686
To conclude, then:

228
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,478
We humans control the world
because we live in a dual reality.

229
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,264
All other animals live
in an objective reality.

230
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:33,364
Their reality consists
of objective entities,

231
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:37,331
like rivers and trees
and lions and elephants.

232
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:41,570
We humans, we also live
in an objective reality.

233
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:46,662
In our world, too, there are rivers
and trees and lions and elephants.

234
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,086
But over the centuries,

235
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,837
we have constructed on top
of this objective reality

236
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,354
a second layer of fictional reality,

237
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,942
a reality made of fictional entities,

238
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:05,499
like nations, like gods,
like money, like corporations.

239
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:10,935
And what is amazing is that
as history unfolded,

240
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,355
this fictional reality became
more and more powerful

241
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,880
so that today, the most powerful
forces in the world

242
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,869
are these fictional entities.

243
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:30,329
Today, the very survival of rivers
and trees and lions and elephants

244
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:35,458
depends on the decisions and wishes
of fictional entities,

245
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:40,019
like the United States, like Google,
like the World Bank --

246
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:44,082
entities that exist only
in our own imagination.

247
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:45,901
Thank you.

248
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:50,496
(Applause)

249
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,329
Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have
a new book out.

250
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,156
After Sapiens, you wrote another one,

251
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,767
and it's out in Hebrew, but not
yet translated into ...

252
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,720
Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on
the translation as we speak.

253
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:07,912
BG: In the book, if I
understand it correctly,

254
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:13,565
you argue that the amazing breakthroughs
that we are experiencing right now

255
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,848
not only will potentially
make our lives better,

256
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,108
but they will create -- and I quote you --

257
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:22,750
"... new classes and new class struggles,
just as the industrial revolution did."

258
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:23,997
Can you elaborate for us?

259
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,414
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,

260
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:31,340
we saw the creation of a new class
of the urban proletariat.

261
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:36,474
And much of the political and social
history of the last 200 years involved

262
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:40,124
what to do with this class,
and the new problems and opportunities.

263
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,780
Now, we see the creation of a new
massive class of useless people.

264
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:45,805
(Laughter)

265
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:51,190
As computers become better and better
in more and more fields,

266
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:56,106
there is a distinct possibility that
computers will out-perform us

267
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,733
in most tasks and will make
humans redundant.

268
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:02,494
And then the big political
and economic question

269
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,881
of the 21st century will be,

270
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:07,067
"What do we need humans for?",

271
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,458
or at least, "What do we need
so many humans for?"

272
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,940
BG: Do you have an answer in the book?

273
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:16,984
YNH: At present, the best guess
we have is to keep them happy

274
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,805
with drugs and computer games ...

275
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:19,830
(Laughter)

276
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,125
but this doesn't sound
like a very appealing future.

277
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,958
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying
in the book and now,

278
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:28,768
that for all the discussion
about the growing evidence

279
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:32,555
of significant economic inequality,
we are just kind of at the beginning

280
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,736
of the process?

281
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:35,571
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;

282
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,538
it's seeing all kinds
of possibilities before us.

283
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:44,544
One possibility is this creation
of a new massive class of useless people.

284
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:47,708
Another possibility is
the division of humankind

285
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:50,723
into different biological castes,

286
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:55,038
with the rich being upgraded
into virtual gods,

287
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:59,370
and the poor being degraded
to this level of useless people.

288
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,416
BG: I feel there is another TED talk
coming up in a year or two.

289
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,262
Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.

290
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,442
YNH: Thanks!

291
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,131
(Applause)
