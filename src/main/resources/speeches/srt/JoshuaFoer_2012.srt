1
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,867
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.

2
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:22,919
Imagine yourself standing
outside the front door of your home.

3
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,588
I'd like you to notice
the color of the door,

4
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:28,593
the material that it's made out of.

5
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:36,856
Now visualize a pack
of overweight nudists on bicycles.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,311
(Laughter)

7
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,009
They are competing
in a naked bicycle race,

8
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,254
and they are headed straight
for your front door.

9
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,119
I need you to actually see this.

10
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:49,880
They are pedaling
really hard, they're sweaty,

11
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:52,200
they're bouncing around a lot.

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,251
And they crash straight
into the front door of your home.

13
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:00,567
Bicycles fly everywhere,
wheels roll past you,

14
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:03,209
spokes end up in awkward places.

15
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:08,695
Step over the threshold of your door
into your foyer, your hallway,

16
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,298
whatever's on the other side,

17
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:13,535
and appreciate the quality of the light.

18
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,180
The light is shining
down on Cookie Monster.

19
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:25,292
Cookie Monster is waving at you
from his perch on top of a tan horse.

20
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,100
It's a talking horse.

21
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:31,940
You can practically feel
his blue fur tickling your nose.

22
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:35,910
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie
that he's about to shovel into his mouth.

23
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,536
Walk past him.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,471
Walk past him into your living room.

25
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,137
In your living room,
in full imaginative broadband,

26
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,439
picture Britney Spears.

27
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:51,292
She is scantily clad, she's dancing
on your coffee table,

28
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:53,605
and she's singing
"Hit Me Baby One More Time."

29
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,527
And then, follow me into your kitchen.

30
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,181
In your kitchen, the floor has been
paved over with a yellow brick road,

31
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:06,588
and out of your oven are coming
towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,

32
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:09,533
the Scarecrow and the Lion
from "The Wizard of Oz,"

33
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,796
hand-in-hand, skipping
straight towards you.

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,366
Okay. Open your eyes.

35
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:20,009
I want to tell you
about a very bizarre contest

36
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,671
that is held every spring
in New York City.

37
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:26,318
It's called the United States
Memory Championship.

38
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:29,056
And I had gone to cover
this contest a few years back

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,945
as a science journalist,

40
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:36,417
expecting, I guess, that this was going
to be like the Superbowl of savants.

41
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,452
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,

42
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:43,941
widely varying in both age
and hygienic upkeep.

43
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,946
(Laughter)

44
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,155
They were memorizing
hundreds of random numbers,

45
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,567
looking at them just once.

46
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:57,154
They were memorizing the names of dozens
and dozens and dozens of strangers.

47
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:00,638
They were memorizing
entire poems in just a few minutes.

48
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,200
They were competing
to see who could memorize

49
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,280
the order of a shuffled pack
of playing cards the fastest.

50
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,669
I was like, this is unbelievable.

51
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:11,645
These people must be freaks of nature.

52
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:15,114
And I started talking
to a few of the competitors.

53
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:18,478
This is a guy called Ed Cook,
who had come over from England,

54
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:20,716
where he had one
of the best-trained memories.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,320
And I said to him,
"Ed, when did you realize

56
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:26,002
that you were a savant?"

57
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,116
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.

58
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,448
In fact, I have just an average memory.

59
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:34,481
Everybody who competes
in this contest will tell you

60
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,625
that they have just an average memory.

61
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:43,518
We've all trained ourselves to perform
these utterly miraculous feats of memory

62
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,509
using a set of ancient techniques,

63
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,331
techniques invented
2,500 years ago in Greece,

64
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:53,323
the same techniques that Cicero
had used to memorize his speeches,

65
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:57,120
that medieval scholars had used
to memorize entire books."

66
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,233
And I said, "Whoa. How come
I never heard of this before?"

67
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,461
And we were standing
outside the competition hall,

68
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:10,851
and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant,
but somewhat eccentric English guy,

69
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,342
says to me, "Josh, you're
an American journalist.

70
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,302
Do you know Britney Spears?"

71
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:21,932
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"

72
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,013
"Because I really want
to teach Britney Spears

73
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,917
how to memorize the order
of a shuffled pack of playing cards

74
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,727
on U.S. national television.

75
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:32,830
It will prove to the world
that anybody can do this."

76
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:36,230
(Laughter)

77
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,536
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,529
but maybe you could teach me.

79
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,536
I mean, you've got to start
somewhere, right?"

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,171
And that was the beginning
of a very strange journey for me.

81
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:53,509
I ended up spending
the better part of the next year

82
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,327
not only training my memory,

83
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,287
but also investigating it,

84
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,295
trying to understand how it works,

85
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,298
why it sometimes doesn't work,

86
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,972
and what its potential might be.

87
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:06,189
And I met a host
of really interesting people.

88
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:08,083
This is a guy called E.P.

89
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,379
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,

90
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:13,088
the worst memory in the world.

91
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,881
His memory was so bad,

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,826
that he didn't even remember
he had a memory problem,

93
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,384
which is amazing.

94
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,362
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,

95
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:26,898
but he was a window into the extent
to which our memories make us who we are.

96
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,493
At the other end
of the spectrum, I met this guy.

97
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:34,144
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis
for Dustin Hoffman's character

98
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,445
in the movie "Rain Man."

99
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:40,008
We spent an afternoon together
in the Salt Lake City Public Library

100
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:42,163
memorizing phone books,

101
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:44,766
which was scintillating.

102
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,523
(Laughter)

103
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,705
And I went back and I read
a whole host of memory treatises,

104
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,117
treatises written 2,000-plus
years ago in Latin,

105
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,815
in antiquity, and then later,
in the Middle Ages.

106
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,990
And I learned a whole bunch
of really interesting stuff.

107
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,036
One of the really interesting
things that I learned

108
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,310
is that once upon a time,

109
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:13,602
this idea of having a trained,
disciplined, cultivated memory

110
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:18,221
was not nearly so alien
as it would seem to us to be today.

111
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:22,867
Once upon a time,
people invested in their memories,

112
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:27,115
in laboriously furnishing their minds.

113
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,015
Over the last few millenia,

114
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,761
we've invented a series of technologies --

115
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,171
from the alphabet, to the scroll,

116
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,490
to the codex, the printing
press, photography,

117
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:39,781
the computer, the smartphone --

118
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,336
that have made it progressively
easier and easier

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,166
for us to externalize our memories,

120
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,510
for us to essentially outsource
this fundamental human capacity.

121
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:54,812
These technologies have made
our modern world possible,

122
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,273
but they've also changed us.

123
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,554
They've changed us culturally,

124
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,712
and I would argue that they've
changed us cognitively.

125
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,442
Having little need to remember anymore,

126
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,681
it sometimes seems
like we've forgotten how.

127
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:10,109
One of the last places on Earth
where you still find

128
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:15,526
people passionate about this idea of
a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,

129
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,173
is at this totally singular
memory contest.

130
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,841
It's actually not that singular,

131
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,886
there are contests held
all over the world.

132
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,711
And I was fascinated,
I wanted to know how do these guys do it.

133
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:30,855
A few years back a group of researchers
at University College London

134
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,605
brought a bunch of memory
champions into the lab.

135
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:34,885
They wanted to know:

136
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,844
Do these guys have brains
that are somehow structurally,

137
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:40,566
anatomically different
from the rest of ours?

138
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,986
The answer was no.

139
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,802
Are they smarter than the rest of us?

140
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,865
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests,
and the answer was: not really.

141
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,111
There was, however, one really
interesting and telling difference

142
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,219
between the brains of the memory champions

143
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,005
and the control subjects
that they were comparing them to.

144
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:02,495
When they put these guys
in an fMRI machine,

145
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,856
scanned their brains
while they were memorizing numbers

146
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,513
and people's faces
and pictures of snowflakes,

147
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:13,393
they found that the memory champions were
lighting up different parts of the brain

148
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,702
than everyone else.

149
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:18,369
Of note, they were using,
or they seemed to be using,

150
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:22,493
a part of the brain that's involved
in spatial memory and navigation.

151
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,509
Why?

152
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,188
And is there something
that the rest of us can learn from this?

153
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:36,366
The sport of competitive memorizing
is driven by a kind of arms race where,

154
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,449
every year, somebody comes up with a new
way to remember more stuff more quickly,

155
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,925
and then the rest of the field
has to play catch-up.

156
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,568
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,

157
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,734
three-time world memory champion.

158
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:52,916
On his desk in front of him
are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards

159
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,004
that he is about to try
to memorize in one hour,

160
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:00,083
using a technique that he invented
and he alone has mastered.

161
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,828
He used a similar technique

162
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:09,650
to memorize the precise order
of 4,140 random binary digits

163
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,725
in half an hour.

164
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,273
(Laughter)

165
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,512
Yeah.

166
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:18,219
And while there are a whole host of ways

167
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:22,254
of remembering stuff
in these competitions,

168
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,936
everything, all of the techniques
that are being used,

169
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,296
ultimately come down to a concept

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,653
that psychologists refer to
as "elaborative encoding."

171
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,625
And it's well-illustrated
by a nifty paradox

172
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,233
known as the Baker/baker paradox,
which goes like this:

173
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:40,129
If I tell two people
to remember the same word,

174
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:41,696
if I say to you,

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,323
"Remember that
there is a guy named Baker."

176
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,829
That's his name.

177
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:51,617
And I say to you, "Remember
that there is a guy who is a baker."

178
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:52,806
Okay?

179
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:56,456
And I come back to you
at some point later on,

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,175
and I say, "Do you remember that word
that I told you a while back?

181
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,071
Do you remember what it was?"

182
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:05,338
The person who was told his name is Baker

183
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:08,423
is less likely to remember the same word

184
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,725
than the person was told
his job is a baker.

185
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:15,145
Same word, different amount
of remembering; that's weird.

186
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,812
What's going on here?

187
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:21,830
Well, the name Baker
doesn't actually mean anything to you.

188
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:26,067
It is entirely untethered
from all of the other memories

189
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,582
floating around in your skull.

190
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,760
But the common noun "baker" --
we know bakers.

191
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:32,919
Bakers wear funny white hats.

192
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,546
Bakers have flour on their hands.

193
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,856
Bakers smell good
when they come home from work.

194
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,885
Maybe we even know a baker.

195
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,638
And when we first hear that word,

196
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,178
we start putting these
associational hooks into it,

197
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:46,717
that make it easier to fish it
back out at some later date.

198
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:52,148
The entire art of what is going on
in these memory contests,

199
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,984
and the entire art of remembering
stuff better in everyday life,

200
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:59,769
is figuring out ways
to transform capital B Bakers

201
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,658
into lower-case B bakers --

202
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:04,970
to take information
that is lacking in context,

203
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:07,050
in significance, in meaning,

204
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:08,600
and transform it in some way,

205
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:12,822
so that it becomes meaningful
in the light of all the other things

206
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,805
that you have in your mind.

207
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,683
One of the more elaborate
techniques for doing this

208
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:22,908
dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.

209
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
It came to be known as the memory palace.

210
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,999
The story behind its creation
goes like this:

211
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,654
There was a poet called Simonides,
who was attending a banquet.

212
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,742
He was actually the hired entertainment,

213
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:38,862
because back then, if you wanted
to throw a really slamming party,

214
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,494
you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.

215
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:47,492
And he stands up, delivers his poem
from memory, walks out the door,

216
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,620
and at the moment he does,

217
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,317
the banquet hall collapses.

218
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,629
Kills everybody inside.

219
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,495
It doesn't just kill everybody,

220
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,501
it mangles the bodies
beyond all recognition.

221
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,962
Nobody can say who was inside,

222
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,550
nobody can say where they were sitting.

223
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:08,789
The bodies can't be properly buried.

224
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,076
It's one tragedy compounding another.

225
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,336
Simonides, standing outside,

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,467
the sole survivor amid the wreckage,

227
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:21,884
closes his eyes and has this realization,

228
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,849
which is that in his mind's eye,

229
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:28,564
he can see where each of the guests
at the banquet had been sitting.

230
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,382
And he takes the relatives by the hand,

231
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,194
and guides them each
to their loved ones amid the wreckage.

232
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,816
What Simonides figured out at that moment,

233
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,039
is something that I think
we all kind of intuitively know,

234
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:47,190
which is that, as bad as we are
at remembering names and phone numbers,

235
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:50,213
and word-for-word instructions
from our colleagues,

236
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:54,600
we have really exceptional
visual and spatial memories.

237
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,403
If I asked you to recount
the first 10 words of the story

238
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,029
that I just told you about Simonides,

239
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,623
chances are you would have
a tough time with it.

240
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:09,066
But, I would wager
that if I asked you to recall

241
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,787
who is sitting on top
of a talking tan horse

242
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,827
in your foyer right now,

243
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,366
you would be able to see that.

244
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,494
The idea behind the memory palace

245
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:25,081
is to create this imagined edifice
in your mind's eye,

246
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,168
and populate it with images
of the things that you want to remember --

247
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:32,437
the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,

248
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:36,308
funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,

249
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,975
the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

250
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,745
This is advice that goes
back 2,000-plus years

251
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,944
to the earliest Latin memory treatises.

252
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,547
So how does this work?

253
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:53,076
Let's say that you've been invited
to TED center stage to give a speech,

254
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,738
and you want to do it from memory,

255
00:13:55,762 --> 00:14:00,346
and you want to do it the way
that Cicero would have done it,

256
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,885
if he had been invited
to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.

257
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:05,480
(Laughter)

258
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,275
What you might do

259
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,829
is picture yourself
at the front door of your house.

260
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:18,129
And you'd come up with some sort
of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,

261
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,921
to remind you that the first thing
you want to talk about

262
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,203
is this totally bizarre contest.

263
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,361
(Laughter)

264
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,350
And then you'd go inside your house,

265
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:31,089
and you would see an image
of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.

266
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,358
And that would remind you

267
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:35,259
that you would want to then
introduce your friend Ed Cook.

268
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:38,196
And then you'd see
an image of Britney Spears

269
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,008
to remind you of this funny
anecdote you want to tell.

270
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,537
And you'd go into your kitchen,

271
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,893
and the fourth topic
you were going to talk about

272
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,463
was this strange journey
that you went on for a year,

273
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,796
and you'd have some friends
to help you remember that.

274
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:56,646
This is how Roman orators
memorized their speeches --

275
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,967
not word-for-word, which is just
going to screw you up,

276
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:02,054
but topic-for-topic.

277
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,982
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --

278
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:08,998
that comes from the Greek word "topos,"

279
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:10,379
which means "place."

280
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:14,590
That's a vestige of when people used
to think about oratory and rhetoric

281
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,504
in these sorts of spatial terms.

282
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:18,834
The phrase "in the first place,"

283
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:21,559
that's like "in the first place
of your memory palace."

284
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:24,153
I thought this was just fascinating,

285
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,710
and I got really into it.

286
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,492
And I went to a few more
of these memory contests,

287
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,231
and I had this notion
that I might write something longer

288
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,112
about this subculture
of competitive memorizers.

289
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,850
But there was a problem.

290
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:39,445
The problem was that a memory contest

291
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,701
is a pathologically boring event.

292
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,884
(Laughter)

293
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:49,877
Truly, it is like a bunch of people
sitting around taking the SATs --

294
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,160
I mean, the most dramatic it gets

295
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,493
is when somebody
starts massaging their temples.

296
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:57,064
And I'm a journalist,
I need something to write about.

297
00:15:57,088 --> 00:16:00,516
I know that there's incredible stuff
happening in these people's minds,

298
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,285
but I don't have access to it.

299
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,460
And I realized, if I was going
to tell this story,

300
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:07,642
I needed to walk
in their shoes a little bit.

301
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,393
And so I started trying
to spend 15 or 20 minutes

302
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:14,155
every morning, before I sat
down with my New York Times,

303
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,329
just trying to remember something.

304
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,350
Maybe it was a poem,

305
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:22,082
maybe it was names from an old yearbook
that I bought at a flea market.

306
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:27,861
And I found that this was shockingly fun.

307
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,139
I never would have expected that.

308
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:33,695
It was fun because this is actually
not about training your memory.

309
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,715
What you're doing, is you're trying
to get better and better

310
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,771
at creating, at dreaming up,

311
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:42,181
these utterly ludicrous,
raunchy, hilarious,

312
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,282
and hopefully unforgettable
images in your mind's eye.

313
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:47,373
And I got pretty into it.

314
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:53,334
This is me wearing my standard
competitive memorizer's training kit.

315
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:54,571
(Laughter)

316
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:55,996
It's a pair of earmuffs

317
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,972
and a set of safety goggles
that have been masked over

318
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,078
except for two small pinholes,

319
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:07,290
because distraction is the competitive
memorizer's greatest enemy.

320
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,469
I ended up coming back
to that same contest

321
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,334
that I had covered a year earlier,

322
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,484
and I had this notion
that I might enter it,

323
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:18,809
sort of as an experiment
in participatory journalism.

324
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,475
It'd make, I thought, maybe
a nice epilogue to all my research.

325
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,314
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.

326
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,243
I won the contest --

327
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:29,371
(Laughter)

328
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:32,267
which really wasn't supposed to happen.

329
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:38,527
(Applause)

330
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:43,059
Now, it is nice to be able
to memorize speeches

331
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,182
and phone numbers and shopping lists,

332
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:49,285
but it's actually kind
of beside the point.

333
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:50,893
These are just tricks.

334
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:56,312
They work because they're based
on some pretty basic principles

335
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,088
about how our brains work.

336
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:02,040
And you don't have to be
building memory palaces

337
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,302
or memorizing packs of playing cards

338
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:08,703
to benefit from a little bit of insight
about how your mind works.

339
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,918
We often talk about people
with great memories

340
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,091
as though it were some sort
of an innate gift,

341
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,394
but that is not the case.

342
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,401
Great memories are learned.

343
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,923
At the most basic level,
we remember when we pay attention.

344
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,255
We remember when we are deeply engaged.

345
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,421
We remember when we are able to take
a piece of information and experience,

346
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:31,527
and figure out why it is meaningful to us,

347
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,965
why it is significant, why it's colorful,

348
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,953
when we're able to transform it
in some way that makes sense

349
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:41,317
in the light of all of the other
things floating around in our minds,

350
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:45,118
when we're able to transform
Bakers into bakers.

351
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,079
The memory palace,
these memory techniques --

352
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,515
they're just shortcuts.

353
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,099
In fact, they're not
even really shortcuts.

354
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:56,019
They work because they make you work.

355
00:18:56,837 --> 00:19:00,079
They force a kind of depth of processing,

356
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,600
a kind of mindfulness,

357
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:05,504
that most of us don't normally
walk around exercising.

358
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:08,115
But there actually are no shortcuts.

359
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,100
This is how stuff is made memorable.

360
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,551
And I think if there's one thing
that I want to leave you with,

361
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:22,103
it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't
even remember he had a memory problem,

362
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,324
left me with,

363
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:29,864
which is the notion that our lives
are the sum of our memories.

364
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:36,649
How much are we willing to lose

365
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:40,322
from our already short lives,

366
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:45,918
by losing ourselves
in our Blackberries, our iPhones,

367
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:50,804
by not paying attention
to the human being across from us

368
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,379
who is talking with us,

369
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:57,085
by being so lazy that we're not
willing to process deeply?

370
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,003
I learned firsthand

371
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:04,496
that there are incredible
memory capacities

372
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,536
latent in all of us.

373
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,002
But if you want to live a memorable life,

374
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:12,335
you have to be the kind of person

375
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,732
who remembers to remember.

376
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,908
Thank you.

377
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:19,616
(Applause)
