1
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,348
I am a writer.

2
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,108
Writing books is my profession
but it's more than that, of course.

3
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:22,032
It is also my great lifelong
love and fascination.

4
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,947
And I don't expect
that that's ever going to change.

5
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:29,982
But, that said, something
kind of peculiar has happened recently

6
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,231
in my life and in my career,

7
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:36,998
which has caused me to have to recalibrate
my whole relationship with this work.

8
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,632
And the peculiar thing
is that I recently wrote this book,

9
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,600
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"

10
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:47,165
which, decidedly
unlike any of my previous books,

11
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,233
went out in the world
for some reason, and became this big,

12
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:53,599
mega-sensation, international
bestseller thing.

13
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:56,665
The result of which
is that everywhere I go now,

14
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,265
people treat me like I'm doomed.

15
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,147
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!

16
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:04,838
Like, they come up to me now,
all worried, and they say,

17
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:09,036
"Aren't you afraid you're never
going to be able to top that?

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,282
Aren't you afraid you're going
to keep writing for your whole life

19
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,449
and you're never again
going to create a book

20
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,015
that anybody in the world
cares about at all,

21
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,515
ever again?"

22
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,864
So that's reassuring, you know.

23
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,675
But it would be worse,
except for that I happen to remember

24
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,934
that over 20 years ago,
when I was a teenager,

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,081
when I first started telling people
that I wanted to be a writer,

26
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,652
I was met with this same
sort of fear-based reaction.

27
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,486
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid
you're never going to have any success?

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,433
Aren't you afraid the humiliation
of rejection will kill you?

29
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:43,917
Aren't you afraid that you're going
to work your whole life at this craft

30
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,797
and nothing's ever going to come of it

31
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,456
and you're going to die
on a scrap heap of broken dreams

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,947
with your mouth filled
with bitter ash of failure?"

33
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,300
(Laughter)

34
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:54,152
Like that, you know.

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,313
The answer -- the short answer
to all those questions is, "Yes."

36
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:01,613
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.

37
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:02,878
And I always have been.

38
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:05,188
And I'm afraid of many,
many more things besides

39
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,113
that people can't even guess at,

40
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:11,094
like seaweed and other
things that are scary.

41
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,345
But, when it comes to writing,

42
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:17,329
the thing that I've been sort of thinking
about lately, and wondering about lately,

43
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,503
is why?

44
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,797
You know, is it rational?

45
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:22,044
Is it logical that anybody
should be expected

46
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:26,696
to be afraid of the work that they feel
they were put on this Earth to do.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,096
And what is it specifically
about creative ventures

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,568
that seems to make us really nervous
about each other's mental health

49
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:37,595
in a way that other careers
kind of don't do, you know?

50
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:41,618
Like my dad, for example,
was a chemical engineer

51
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:44,995
and I don't recall once in his 40 years
of chemical engineering

52
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,677
anybody asking him if he was afraid
to be a chemical engineer, you know?

53
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:54,488
"That chemical-engineering block,
John, how's it going?"

54
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,652
It just didn't come up
like that, you know?

55
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,486
But to be fair,
chemical engineers as a group

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,034
haven't really earned
a reputation over the centuries

57
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,730
for being alcoholic manic-depressives.

58
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,178
(Laughter)

59
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,012
We writers, we kind of do have
that reputation,

60
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,995
and not just writers,
but creative people across all genres,

61
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,696
it seems, have this reputation
for being enormously mentally unstable.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,512
And all you have to do is look
at the very grim death count

63
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,095
in the 20th century alone,
of really magnificent creative minds

64
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,221
who died young and often
at their own hands, you know?

65
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,487
And even the ones
who didn't literally commit suicide

66
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,863
seem to be really undone
by their gifts, you know.

67
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,762
Norman Mailer, just before he died,
last interview, he said,

68
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:42,863
"Every one of my books
has killed me a little more."

69
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:46,462
An extraordinary statement
to make about your life's work.

70
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,422
But we don't even blink
when we hear somebody say this,

71
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,028
because we've heard
that kind of stuff for so long

72
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:56,029
and somehow we've completely
internalized and accepted collectively

73
00:03:56,053 --> 00:04:00,696
this notion that creativity and suffering
are somehow inherently linked

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,762
and that artistry, in the end,
will always ultimately lead to anguish.

75
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,453
And the question that I want
to ask everybody here today

76
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,970
is are you guys all cool with that idea?

77
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:13,177
Are you comfortable with that?

78
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,201
Because you look at it
even from an inch away and, you know --

79
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:19,328
I'm not at all comfortable
with that assumption.

80
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:20,814
I think it's odious.

81
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,767
And I also think it's dangerous,

82
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,696
and I don't want to see it
perpetuated into the next century.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,570
I think it's better if we encourage
our great creative minds to live.

84
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:35,345
And I definitely know that,
in my case -- in my situation --

85
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:40,508
it would be very dangerous for me to start
sort of leaking down that dark path

86
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,729
of assumption,

87
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:45,882
particularly given the circumstance
that I'm in right now in my career.

88
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,421
Which is -- you know, like check it out,

89
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,636
I'm pretty young,
I'm only about 40 years old.

90
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,930
I still have maybe another four
decades of work left in me.

91
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:58,447
And it's exceedingly likely that anything
I write from this point forward

92
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:01,424
is going to be judged by the world
as the work that came after

93
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,747
the freakish success
of my last book, right?

94
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,709
I should just put it bluntly, because
we're all sort of friends here now --

95
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:12,990
it's exceedingly likely
that my greatest success is behind me.

96
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,190
So Jesus, what a thought!

97
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,620
That's the kind of thought
that could lead a person

98
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:20,248
to start drinking gin
at nine o'clock in the morning,

99
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:23,185
and I don't want to go there.

100
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,243
(Laughter)

101
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:26,697
I would prefer to keep doing
this work that I love.

102
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:30,035
And so, the question becomes, how?

103
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,919
And so, it seems to me,
upon a lot of reflection,

104
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:36,284
that the way that I have to work now,
in order to continue writing,

105
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:40,118
is that I have to create some sort of
protective psychological construct, right?

106
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:43,618
I have to sort of find some way
to have a safe distance

107
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:48,503
between me, as I am writing,
and my very natural anxiety

108
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,368
about what the reaction to that writing
is going to be, from now on.

109
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:54,779
And, as I've been looking,
over the last year,

110
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,636
for models for how to do that,

111
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,784
I've been sort of looking across time,

112
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,886
and I've been trying
to find other societies

113
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,636
to see if they might have had
better and saner ideas than we have

114
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,863
about how to help creative people

115
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:10,669
sort of manage the inherent
emotional risks of creativity.

116
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:15,684
And that search has led me
to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

117
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,375
So stay with me, because
it does circle around and back.

118
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,531
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --

119
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,097
people did not happen
to believe that creativity

120
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,515
came from human beings back then, O.K.?

121
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,974
People believed that creativity
was this divine attendant spirit

122
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:33,975
that came to human beings
from some distant and unknowable source,

123
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:36,424
for distant and unknowable reasons.

124
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:41,675
The Greeks famously called these divine
attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."

125
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,775
Socrates, famously, believed
that he had a daemon

126
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,232
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.

127
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,849
The Romans had the same idea,

128
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:53,459
but they called that sort of disembodied
creative spirit a genius.

129
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:56,198
Which is great, because the Romans
did not actually think

130
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,992
that a genius was a particularly
clever individual.

131
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:02,675
They believed that a genius was this,
sort of magical divine entity,

132
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,997
who was believed to literally
live in the walls of an artist's studio,

133
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,541
kind of like Dobby the house elf,

134
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,079
and who would come out

135
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,705
and sort of invisibly assist
the artist with their work

136
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,174
and would shape the outcome of that work.

137
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,056
So brilliant -- there it is, right there,
that distance that I'm talking about --

138
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,258
that psychological construct to protect
you from the results of your work.

139
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:28,866
And everyone knew that this
is how it functioned, right?

140
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,557
So the ancient artist was protected
from certain things,

141
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,958
like, for example,
too much narcissism, right?

142
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:37,173
If your work was brilliant,
you couldn't take all the credit for it,

143
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:40,892
everybody knew that you had this
disembodied genius who had helped you.

144
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,261
If your work bombed,
not entirely your fault, you know?

145
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,779
Everyone knew your genius
was kind of lame.

146
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:47,837
(Laughter)

147
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:51,359
And this is how people
thought about creativity in the West

148
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,691
for a really long time.

149
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,291
And then the Renaissance came
and everything changed,

150
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:57,606
and we had this big idea,
and the big idea was,

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,825
let's put the individual human being
at the center of the universe

152
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,390
above all gods and mysteries,

153
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,699
and there's no more room
for mystical creatures

154
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,491
who take dictation from the divine.

155
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,626
And it's the beginning
of rational humanism,

156
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,793
and people started
to believe that creativity

157
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:13,157
came completely from the self
of the individual.

158
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:15,007
And for the first time in history,

159
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:20,118
you start to hear people referring
to this or that artist as being a genius,

160
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,959
rather than having a genius.

161
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:25,283
And I got to tell you,
I think that was a huge error.

162
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:29,529
You know, I think that allowing
somebody, one mere person

163
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:32,292
to believe that he or she is like,
the vessel,

164
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,888
you know, like the font
and the essence and the source

165
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:38,241
of all divine, creative,
unknowable, eternal mystery

166
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:44,326
is just a smidge too much responsibility
to put on one fragile, human psyche.

167
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,841
It's like asking somebody
to swallow the sun.

168
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,492
It just completely warps
and distorts egos,

169
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:54,042
and it creates all these unmanageable
expectations about performance.

170
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,041
And I think the pressure of that

171
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,258
has been killing off our artists
for the last 500 years.

172
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,923
And, if this is true,

173
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,509
and I think it is true,

174
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,374
the question becomes, what now?

175
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,243
Can we do this differently?

176
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:11,639
Maybe go back to some more
ancient understanding

177
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:16,140
about the relationship between humans
and the creative mystery.

178
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,493
Maybe not.

179
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:21,375
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years
of rational humanistic thought

180
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,533
in one 18 minute speech.

181
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,242
And there's probably
people in this audience

182
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,357
who would raise really
legitimate scientific suspicions

183
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,736
about the notion of, basically fairies

184
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,724
who follow people around rubbing fairy
juice on their projects and stuff.

185
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:42,041
I'm not, probably, going to bring
you all along with me on this.

186
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,826
But the question
that I kind of want to pose is --

187
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,023
you know, why not?

188
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,945
Why not think about it this way?

189
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:53,057
Because it makes as much sense
as anything else I have ever heard

190
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:57,013
in terms of explaining
the utter maddening capriciousness

191
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,558
of the creative process.

192
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,773
A process which, as anybody
who has ever tried to make something --

193
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:03,863
which is to say basically
everyone here ---

194
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:06,974
knows does not always behave rationally.

195
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:11,557
And, in fact, can sometimes
feel downright paranormal.

196
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,333
I had this encounter recently

197
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:17,042
where I met the extraordinary
American poet Ruth Stone,

198
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,877
who's now in her 90s,
but she's been a poet her entire life

199
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:23,107
and she told me that when
she was growing up in rural Virginia,

200
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,989
she would be out working in the fields,

201
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,865
and she said she would feel
and hear a poem

202
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,872
coming at her from over the landscape.

203
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,029
And she said it was like
a thunderous train of air.

204
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:35,857
And it would come barreling down
at her over the landscape.

205
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,359
And she felt it coming, because it
would shake the earth under her feet.

206
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,158
She knew that she had
only one thing to do at that point,

207
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,409
and that was to,
in her words, "run like hell."

208
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,441
And she would run like hell to the house

209
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,627
and she would be getting
chased by this poem,

210
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:52,257
and the whole deal was that she had
to get to a piece of paper and a pencil

211
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:55,662
fast enough so that when it thundered
through her, she could collect it

212
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:56,868
and grab it on the page.

213
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,981
And other times
she wouldn't be fast enough,

214
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,208
so she'd be running and running,
and she wouldn't get to the house

215
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:05,046
and the poem would barrel
through her and she would miss it

216
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,690
and she said it would continue
on across the landscape,

217
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,798
looking, as she put it "for another poet."

218
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,468
And then there were these times --

219
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,347
this is the piece I never forgot --

220
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:16,829
she said that there were moments
where she would almost miss it, right?

221
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,880
So, she's running to the house
and she's looking for the paper

222
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:21,497
and the poem passes through her,

223
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,131
and she grabs a pencil just
as it's going through her,

224
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:27,499
and then she said, it was like
she would reach out with her other hand

225
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:28,806
and she would catch it.

226
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,787
She would catch the poem by its tail,

227
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,365
and she would pull it
backwards into her body

228
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,225
as she was transcribing on the page.

229
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:40,080
And in these instances, the poem would
come up on the page perfect and intact

230
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:43,485
but backwards, from the last
word to the first.

231
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,197
(Laughter)

232
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:49,914
So when I heard that I was like --
that's uncanny,

233
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:52,415
that's exactly what my creative
process is like.

234
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:56,028
(Laughter)

235
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:59,394
That's not at all what my creative
process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

236
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,448
I'm a mule, and the way
that I have to work

237
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,715
is I have to get up
at the same time every day,

238
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:06,549
and sweat and labor and barrel
through it really awkwardly.

239
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,412
But even I, in my mulishness,

240
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,280
even I have brushed
up against that thing, at times.

241
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:14,543
And I would imagine
that a lot of you have too.

242
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,848
You know, even I have had work
or ideas come through me from a source

243
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,359
that I honestly cannot identify.

244
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,955
And what is that thing?

245
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,993
And how are we to relate to it in a way
that will not make us lose our minds,

246
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:28,879
but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?

247
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:32,658
And for me, the best contemporary
example that I have of how to do that

248
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,990
is the musician Tom Waits,

249
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:39,531
who I got to interview several years ago
on a magazine assignment.

250
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,032
And we were talking about this,

251
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:44,593
and you know, Tom, for most of his life,
he was pretty much the embodiment

252
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,713
of the tormented
contemporary modern artist,

253
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:49,040
trying to control and manage and dominate

254
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:51,514
these sort of uncontrollable
creative impulses

255
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,401
that were totally internalized.

256
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,406
But then he got older, he got calmer,

257
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,329
and one day he was driving down
the freeway in Los Angeles,

258
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,265
and this is when it all changed for him.

259
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,355
And he's speeding along,
and all of a sudden

260
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:05,901
he hears this little fragment of melody,

261
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,930
that comes into his head as inspiration
often comes, elusive and tantalizing,

262
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:12,058
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,

263
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,383
and he longs for it,
but he has no way to get it.

264
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,558
He doesn't have a piece of paper,
or a pencil, or a tape recorder.

265
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:20,642
So he starts to feel all of that old
anxiety start to rise in him

266
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,407
like, "I'm going to lose this thing,

267
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:24,527
and I'll be be haunted
by this song forever.

268
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,456
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."

269
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,490
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.

270
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:32,632
He just stopped that whole mental process
and he did something completely novel.

271
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:35,115
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,

272
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,129
"Excuse me, can you not
see that I'm driving?"

273
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:41,830
(Laughter)

274
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,564
"Do I look like I can write
down a song right now?

275
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:48,409
If you really want to exist,
come back at a more opportune moment

276
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,071
when I can take care of you.

277
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,148
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.

278
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:56,444
Go bother Leonard Cohen."

279
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,576
And his whole work process
changed after that.

280
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,184
Not the work, the work was still
oftentimes as dark as ever.

281
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,243
But the process, and the heavy
anxiety around it

282
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:09,190
was released when he took
the genie, the genius out of him

283
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:13,101
where it was causing nothing but trouble,
and released it back where it came from,

284
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,762
and realized that this didn't have to be
this internalized, tormented thing.

285
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,900
It could be this peculiar,
wondrous, bizarre collaboration,

286
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:24,032
kind of conversation between
Tom and the strange, external thing

287
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,535
that was not quite Tom.

288
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,972
When I heard that story,
it started to shift a little bit

289
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:32,001
the way that I worked too,
and this idea already saved me once.

290
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:35,129
It saved me when I was in the middle
of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"

291
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,662
and I fell into one of those
sort of pits of despair

292
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:41,142
that we all fall into when we're working
on something and it's not coming

293
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,326
and you start to think this is going to be
a disaster, the worst book ever written.

294
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,700
Not just bad, but the worst
book ever written.

295
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:51,115
And I started to think I should
just dump this project.

296
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,190
But then I remembered Tom
talking to the open air

297
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:56,238
and I tried it.

298
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,730
So I just lifted my face
up from the manuscript

299
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:01,660
and I directed my comments
to an empty corner of the room.

300
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:05,238
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,

301
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,436
you and I both know
that if this book isn't brilliant

302
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,237
that is not entirely my fault, right?

303
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:13,493
Because you can see that I am putting
everything I have into this,

304
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,132
I don't have any more than this.

305
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:18,941
If you want it to be better, you've got
to show up and do your part of the deal.

306
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:21,782
But if you don't do that,
you know what, the hell with it.

307
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,488
I'm going to keep writing anyway
because that's my job.

308
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,948
And I would please
like the record to reflect today

309
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:28,970
that I showed up for my part of the job."

310
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,985
(Laughter)

311
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,072
Because --

312
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,146
(Applause)

313
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,318
Because in the end it's like this, OK --

314
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,719
centuries ago in the deserts
of North Africa,

315
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:45,386
people used to gather for these moonlight
dances of sacred dance and music

316
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,090
that would go on for hours
and hours, until dawn.

317
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,334
They were always magnificent,
because the dancers were professionals

318
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:52,788
and they were terrific, right?

319
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:56,109
But every once in a while, very rarely,
something would happen,

320
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,621
and one of these performers
would actually become transcendent.

321
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,905
And I know you know
what I'm talking about,

322
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,725
because I know you've all seen,
at some point in your life,

323
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:06,025
a performance like this.

324
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,954
It was like time would stop,

325
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:10,883
and the dancer would sort of step
through some kind of portal

326
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,787
and he wasn't doing anything different

327
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:14,820
than he had ever done,
1,000 nights before,

328
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,571
but everything would align.

329
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,738
And all of a sudden, he would
no longer appear to be merely human.

330
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,137
He would be lit from within,
and lit from below

331
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,927
and all lit up on fire with divinity.

332
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,072
And when this happened, back then,

333
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:32,288
people knew it for what it was,
you know, they called it by its name.

334
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:35,455
They would put their hands together
and they would start to chant,

335
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:39,020
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."

336
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:42,122
That's God, you know.

337
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,802
Curious historical footnote:

338
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:49,643
when the Moors invaded southern Spain,
they took this custom with them

339
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,953
and the pronunciation
changed over the centuries

340
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,753
from "Allah, Allah, Allah,"
to "Olé, olé, olé,"

341
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,927
which you still hear in bullfights
and in flamenco dances.

342
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,580
In Spain, when a performer has done
something impossible and magic,

343
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,729
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah,
magnificent, bravo,"

344
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:07,120
incomprehensible, there it is
-- a glimpse of God.

345
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,305
Which is great, because we need that.

346
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,156
But, the tricky bit
comes the next morning,

347
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,583
for the dancer himself,
when he wakes up and discovers

348
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:21,030
that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m.,
and he's no longer a glimpse of God.

349
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:24,522
He's just an aging mortal
with really bad knees,

350
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:28,762
and maybe he's never going
to ascend to that height again.

351
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:32,489
And maybe nobody will ever chant
God's name again as he spins,

352
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:35,347
and what is he then to do
with the rest of his life?

353
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:36,729
This is hard.

354
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,571
This is one of the most painful
reconciliations to make

355
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:41,662
in a creative life.

356
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,845
But maybe it doesn't have to be
quite so full of anguish

357
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:48,112
if you never happened
to believe, in the first place,

358
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:52,217
that the most extraordinary aspects
of your being came from you.

359
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:55,078
But maybe if you just believed
that they were on loan to you

360
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:58,686
from some unimaginable source
for some exquisite portion of your life

361
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,726
to be passed along when you're finished,

362
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,576
with somebody else.

363
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:07,382
And, you know, if we think about it
this way, it starts to change everything.

364
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:09,246
This is how I've started to think,

365
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,595
and this is certainly how I've been
thinking in the last few months

366
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,524
as I've been working on the book
that will soon be published,

367
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:19,079
as the dangerously, frighteningly
over-anticipated follow up

368
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,739
to my freakish success.

369
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:24,662
And what I have to
sort of keep telling myself

370
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,862
when I get really psyched out
about that is don't be afraid.

371
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:32,211
Don't be daunted. Just do your job.

372
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:35,331
Continue to show up for your piece of it,
whatever that might be.

373
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:38,096
If your job is to dance, do your dance.

374
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,061
If the divine, cockeyed genius
assigned to your case

375
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:47,145
decides to let some sort of wonderment
be glimpsed, for just one moment

376
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,849
through your efforts, then "Olé!"

377
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:52,784
And if not, do your dance anyhow.

378
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:54,465
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.

379
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,775
I believe this and I feel
that we must teach it.

380
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,253
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,

381
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:01,566
just for having the sheer
human love and stubbornness

382
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,411
to keep showing up.

383
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,086
Thank you.

384
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,161
(Applause)

385
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,652
Thank you.

386
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:11,766
(Applause)

387
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,599
June Cohen: Olé!

388
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:17,323
(Applause)
