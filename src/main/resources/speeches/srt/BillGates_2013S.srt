1
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,432
Everyone needs a coach.

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,533
It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,811
a tennis player, a gymnast

4
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,032
or a bridge player.

5
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,521
(Laughter)

6
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,980
My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,235
says there are more pictures of the back of her head

8
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:34,752
than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)

9
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:38,414
Sorry, Sharon. Here you go.

10
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:42,005
We all need people who will give us feedback.

11
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,242
That's how we improve.

12
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:47,222
Unfortunately, there's one group of people

13
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:50,028
who get almost no systematic feedback

14
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:52,213
to help them do their jobs better,

15
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:53,612
and these people

16
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:56,762
have one of the most important jobs in the world.

17
00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:58,991
I'm talking about teachers.

18
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,930
When Melinda and I learned

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,142
how little useful feedback most teachers get,

20
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:06,096
we were blown away.

21
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:10,220
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,873
just got one word of feedback:

23
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,593
Satisfactory.

24
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:18,086
If all my bridge coach ever told me

25
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:20,471
was that I was "satisfactory,"

26
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,248
I would have no hope of ever getting better.

27
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:26,546
How would I know who was the best?

28
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:30,146
How would I know what I was doing differently?

29
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:32,530
Today, districts are revamping

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,814
the way they evaluate teachers,

31
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:38,123
but we still give them almost no feedback

32
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:41,296
that actually helps them improve their practice.

33
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:44,628
Our teachers deserve better.

34
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,856
The system we have today isn't fair to them.

35
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,677
It's not fair to students,

36
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:54,707
and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.

37
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:58,166
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers

38
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,424
get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.

39
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:06,290
Let's start by asking who's doing well.

40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,758
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables

41
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,684
for teacher feedback systems.

42
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,474
So I looked at the countries

43
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:16,579
whose students perform well academically,

44
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,884
and looked at what they're doing

45
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:21,923
to help their teachers improve.

46
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:25,156
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.

47
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,646
The U.S. isn't number one.

48
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,701
We're not even in the top 10.

49
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,639
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.

50
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,865
Now, out of all the places

51
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,455
that do better than the U.S. in reading,

52
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,994
how many of them have a formal system

53
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,985
for helping teachers improve?

54
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:47,820
Eleven out of 14.

55
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,385
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,

56
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,986
but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.

57
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:58,070
So there's really only one area where we're near the top,

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,242
and that's in failing to give our teachers

59
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:03,863
the help they need to develop their skills.

60
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:07,420
Let's look at the best academic performer:

61
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,585
the province of Shanghai, China.

62
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:13,918
Now, they rank number one across the board,

63
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:16,837
in reading, math and science,

64
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:20,208
and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success

65
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,842
is the way they help teachers keep improving.

66
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,171
They made sure that younger teachers

67
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,838
get a chance to watch master teachers at work.

68
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:32,112
They have weekly study groups,

69
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,946
where teachers get together and talk about what's working.

70
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:38,301
They even require each teacher to observe

71
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,439
and give feedback to their colleagues.

72
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,138
You might ask, why is a system like this so important?

73
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,996
It's because there's so much variation

74
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,077
in the teaching profession.

75
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:54,234
Some teachers are far more effective than others.

76
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,923
In fact, there are teachers throughout the country

77
00:03:56,923 --> 00:04:00,476
who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.

78
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:02,719
If today's average teacher

79
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,315
could become as good as those teachers,

80
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:09,491
our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.

81
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,398
So we need a system that helps all our teachers

82
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:14,410
be as good as the best.

83
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,007
What would that system look like?

84
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,032
Well, to find out, our foundation

85
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,483
has been working with 3,000 teachers

86
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,667
in districts across the country

87
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:27,886
on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.

88
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:30,237
We had observers watch videos

89
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,983
of teachers in the classroom

90
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:35,571
and rate how they did on a range of practices.

91
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,409
For example, did they ask their students

92
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,500
challenging questions?

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,817
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?

94
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:48,317
We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,

95
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:50,030
"Does your teacher know

96
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,587
when the class understands a lesson?"

97
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,743
"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"

98
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:58,572
And what we found is very exciting.

99
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:02,691
First, the teachers who did well on these observations

100
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,142
had far better student outcomes.

101
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:08,400
So it tells us we're asking the right questions.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,213
And second, teachers in the program told us

103
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:14,763
that these videos and these surveys from the students

104
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:17,446
were very helpful diagnostic tools,

105
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:20,075
because they pointed to specific places

106
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:22,103
where they can improve.

107
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:26,146
I want to show you what this video component of MET

108
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:28,730
looks like in action.

109
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,677
(Music)

110
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,358
(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.

111
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,526
Let's talk about what's going on today.

112
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,875
To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?

113
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,330
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class

114
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,213
is for you to be able to determine

115
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:46,167
whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.

116
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,636
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.

117
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,321
I am a high school English teacher

118
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,384
at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.

119
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,131
Turn to somebody next to you.

120
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:55,930
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about --

121
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,591
I think that there is a difference for teachers

122
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,064
between the abstract of how we see our practice

123
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,707
and then the concrete reality of it.

124
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:07,257
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.

125
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,900
I think what video offers for us

126
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,214
is a certain degree of reality.

127
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:14,850
You can't really dispute what you see on the video,

128
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,809
and there is a lot to be learned from that,

129
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,738
and there are a lot of ways that we can grow

130
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:22,669
as a profession when we actually get to see this.

131
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,662
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod

132
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:29,072
and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.

133
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,580
At the beginning of class, I just perch it

134
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,005
in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.

135
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:36,743
It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.

136
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:40,023
But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.

137
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,072
And I'm able to learn a lot from it.

138
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,957
So it really has been a simple

139
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,803
but powerful tool in my own reflection.

140
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:50,852
All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?

141
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,620
Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,

142
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,256
and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.

143
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,368
If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.

144
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:02,023
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,

145
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:06,110
and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.

146
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,139
I really have used it for my own personal growth

147
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,065
and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy

148
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:14,334
and methodology and classroom management,

149
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,840
and just all of those different facets of the classroom.

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,514
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before

151
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:23,039
so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.

152
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,364
I think that video exposes

153
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,848
so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers

154
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,005
in ways that help us learn and help us understand,

155
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:35,612
and then help our broader communities understand

156
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:39,448
what this complex work is really all about.

157
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:43,580
I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate

158
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,495
things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,

159
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,648
things you cannot convey in a standard,

160
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,877
things that you cannot even sometimes convey

161
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:53,687
in a book of pedagogy.

162
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:56,053
Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.

163
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,289
I'll see you later.

164
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,576
[Every classroom could look like that]

165
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:05,003
(Applause)

166
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,975
Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America

167
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,659
to look something like that.

168
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,280
But we still have more work to do.

169
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,587
is only half the battle.

171
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,972
We also have to give them the tools they need

172
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:23,470
to act on the diagnosis.

173
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,385
If you learn that you need to improve

174
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,126
the way you teach fractions,

175
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,634
you should be able to watch a video

176
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,346
of the best person in the world teaching fractions.

177
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,088
So building this complete teacher feedback

178
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:39,198
and improvement system won't be easy.

179
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:41,208
For example, I know some teachers

180
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,676
aren't immediately comfortable with the idea

181
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:46,476
of a camera in the classroom.

182
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,792
That's understandable, but our experience with MET

183
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:53,237
suggests that if teachers manage the process,

184
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,722
if they collect video in their own classrooms,

185
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,698
and they pick the lessons they want to submit,

186
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:02,459
a lot of them will be eager to participate.

187
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,412
Building this system will also require

188
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,435
a considerable investment.

189
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,792
Our foundation estimates that it could cost

190
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,947
up to five billion dollars.

191
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:18,301
Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,

192
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,294
it's less than two percent

193
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:24,589
of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.

194
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,901
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.

195
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,858
We would finally have a way to give them feedback,

196
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,555
as well as the means to act on it.

197
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,740
But this system would have

198
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,530
an even more important benefit for our country.

199
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,703
It would put us on a path to making sure

200
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:45,902
all our students get a great education,

201
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:48,593
find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,

202
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:51,832
and have a chance to live out their dreams.

203
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:56,186
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.

204
00:09:56,186 --> 00:10:01,690
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.

205
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,425
I'm excited about the opportunity

206
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:09,174
to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.

207
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,901
I hope you are too.

208
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,672
Thank you.

209
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:20,980
(Applause)
