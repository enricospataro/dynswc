1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,370
When I was seven years old
and my sister was just five years old,

2
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:17,796
we were playing on top of a bunk bed.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,846
I was two years older
than my sister at the time --

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,102
I mean, I'm two years
older than her now --

5
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:26,451
but at the time it meant she had to do
everything that I wanted to do,

6
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:27,796
and I wanted to play war.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,876
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,995
And on one side of the bunk bed,

9
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:34,629
I had put out all of my G.I. Joe
soldiers and weaponry.

10
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,541
And on the other side were
all my sister's My Little Ponies

11
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:39,010
ready for a cavalry charge.

12
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:42,327
There are differing accounts
of what actually happened that afternoon,

13
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:44,639
but since my sister is not
here with us today,

14
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,559
let me tell you the true story --

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,796
(Laughter)

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,255
which is my sister's a little
on the clumsy side.

17
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,301
Somehow, without any help or push
from her older brother at all,

18
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:55,795
Amy disappeared
off of the top of the bunk bed

19
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,749
and landed with this crash on the floor.

20
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:59,787
I nervously peered
over the side of the bed

21
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,796
to see what had befallen my fallen sister

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,674
and saw that she had landed
painfully on her hands and knees

23
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,049
on all fours on the ground.

24
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:08,549
I was nervous because
my parents had charged me

25
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,435
with making sure that my sister and I

26
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,796
played as safely
and as quietly as possible.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,472
And seeing as how I had
accidentally broken Amy's arm

28
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:17,796
just one week before --

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,757
(Laughter)

30
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,920
(Laughter ends)

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,604
heroically pushing her out of the way
of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,

32
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,662
(Laughter)

33
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:33,769
for which I have yet to be thanked,
I was trying as hard as I could --

34
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,389
she didn't even see it coming --

35
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,754
I was trying hard
to be on my best behavior.

36
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,128
And I saw my sister's face,

37
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:41,388
this wail of pain
and suffering and surprise

38
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:44,096
threatening to erupt from her mouth
and wake my parents

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,716
from the long winter's nap
for which they had settled.

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,896
So I did the only thing

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,358
my frantic seven year-old brain
could think to do to avert this tragedy.

42
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:54,245
And if you have children,
you've seen this hundreds of times.

43
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,996
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry.
Did you see how you landed?

44
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,140
No human lands on all fours like that.

45
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,796
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,189
(Laughter)

47
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,322
Now, that was cheating,

48
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,475
because there was nothing
she would want more

49
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:12,140
than not to be Amy
the hurt five year-old little sister,

50
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:13,596
but Amy the special unicorn.

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,744
Of course, this option
was open to her brain

52
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,952
at no point in the past.

53
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:20,073
And you could see how my poor,
manipulated sister faced conflict,

54
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,474
as her little brain attempted
to devote resources

55
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:25,797
to feeling the pain and suffering
and surprise she just experienced,

56
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:28,366
or contemplating her new-found
identity as a unicorn.

57
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,496
And the latter won.

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,359
Instead of crying or ceasing our play,

59
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,796
instead of waking my parents,

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,127
with all the negative consequences for me,

61
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,796
a smile spread across her face

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,912
and she scrambled back up
onto the bunk bed

63
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,822
with all the grace of a baby unicorn --

64
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:43,375
(Laughter)

65
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,789
with one broken leg.

66
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:46,415
What we stumbled across

67
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,519
at this tender age
of just five and seven --

68
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,215
we had no idea at the time --

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,340
was was going be at the vanguard
of a scientific revolution

70
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:56,818
occurring two decades later in the way
that we look at the human brain.

71
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,757
We had stumbled across
something called positive psychology,

72
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,426
which is the reason I'm here today

73
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,538
and the reason that I wake up
every morning.

74
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:05,596
When I started talking about this research

75
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,896
outside of academia,
with companies and schools,

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,996
the first thing they said to never do
is to start with a graph.

77
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,474
The first thing I want to do
is start with a graph.

78
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:14,796
This graph looks boring,

79
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,771
but it is the reason I get excited
and wake up every morning.

80
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:20,560
And this graph doesn't even mean
anything; it's fake data.

81
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,855
What we found is --

82
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,796
(Laughter)

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,796
If I got this data studying you,
I would be thrilled,

84
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,796
because there's a trend there,

85
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,796
and that means that I can get published,

86
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,796
which is all that really matters.

87
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,896
There is one weird red dot
above the curve,

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,421
there's one weirdo in the room --

89
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:41,470
I know who you are, I saw you earlier --

90
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:42,796
that's no problem.

91
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,796
That's no problem, as most of you know,
because I can just delete that dot.

92
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,924
I can delete that dot because
that's clearly a measurement error.

93
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:53,314
And we know that's a measurement error
because it's messing up my data.

94
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,377
(Laughter)

95
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,564
So one of the first things we teach people

96
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:59,404
in economics, statistics,
business and psychology courses

97
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:02,593
is how, in a statistically valid way,
do we eliminate the weirdos.

98
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,996
How do we eliminate the outliers
so we can find the line of best fit?

99
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,116
Which is fantastic
if I'm trying to find out

100
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,896
how many Advil the average
person should be taking -- two.

101
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,731
But if I'm interested in your potential,

102
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,796
or for happiness or productivity
or energy or creativity,

103
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,391
we're creating the cult
of the average with science.

104
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,796
If I asked a question like,

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,517
"How fast can a child learn
how to read in a classroom?"

106
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,026
scientists change the answer to

107
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,389
"How fast does the average child
learn how to read in that classroom?"

108
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,559
and we tailor the class
towards the average.

109
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,106
If you fall below the average,

110
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,723
then psychologists get thrilled,

111
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:36,563
because that means you're
depressed or have a disorder,

112
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,796
or hopefully both.

113
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,296
We're hoping for both
because our business model is,

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,796
if you come into a therapy
session with one problem,

115
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,296
we want to make sure you
leave knowing you have ten,

116
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,496
so you keep coming back.

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,735
We'll go back into your
childhood if necessary,

118
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,035
but eventually we want
to make you normal again.

119
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,496
But normal is merely average.

120
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,868
And positive psychology posits
that if we study what is merely average,

121
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,224
we will remain merely average.

122
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,542
Then instead of deleting
those positive outliers,

123
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,608
what I intentionally do is come
into a population like this one

124
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:04,648
and say, why?

125
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,596
Why are some of you high above the curve

126
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,205
in terms of intellectual,
athletic, musical ability,

127
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,496
creativity, energy levels,

128
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,996
resiliency in the face
of challenge, sense of humor?

129
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,563
Whatever it is, instead of deleting
you, what I want to do is study you.

130
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:18,496
Because maybe we can glean information,

131
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,674
not just how to move
people up to the average,

132
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:24,096
but move the entire average up
in our companies and schools worldwide.

133
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,096
The reason this graph is important to me

134
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,196
is, on the news, the majority
of the information is not positive.

135
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,296
in fact it's negative.

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,496
Most of it's about murder, corruption,
diseases, natural disasters.

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,596
And very quickly, my brain starts to think

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,615
that's the accurate ratio
of negative to positive in the world.

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,843
This creates
"the medical school syndrome."

140
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,423
During the first year of medical training,

141
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,835
as you read through a list of all
the symptoms and diseases,

142
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,090
suddenly you realize you have all of them.

143
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,115
(Laughter)

144
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,211
I have a brother in-law named Bobo,
which is a whole other story.

145
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,797
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.

146
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,553
Bobo called me on the phone --

147
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:58,722
(Laughter)

148
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,796
from Yale Medical School,

149
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,101
and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."

150
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,796
(Laughter)

151
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,407
Which, even at Yale,
is extraordinarily rare.

152
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,796
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo

153
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,678
because he had just gotten
over an entire week of menopause.

154
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:13,796
(Laughter)

155
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,796
We're finding it's not necessarily
the reality that shapes us,

156
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,596
but the lens through which your brain
views the world that shapes your reality.

157
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,897
And if we can change the lens,
not only can we change your happiness,

158
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:27,569
we can change every single educational
and business outcome at the same time.

159
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:29,096
I applied to Harvard on a dare.

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,296
I didn't expect to get in, and my family
had no money for college.

161
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,496
When I got a military scholarship
two weeks later, they let me go.

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,296
Something that wasn't
even a possibility became a reality.

163
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,296
I assumed everyone there
would see it as a privilege as well,

164
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,996
that they'd be excited to be there.

165
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,496
Even in a classroom
full of people smarter than you,

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,996
I felt you'd be happy just to be
in that classroom.

167
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,696
But what I found is,
while some people experience that,

168
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,496
when I graduated after my four years

169
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,097
and then spent the next eight years
living in the dorms with the students --

170
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,000
Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.

171
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,796
(Laughter)

172
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,196
I was an officer to counsel students
through the difficult four years.

173
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,987
And in my research and my teaching,

174
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:07,787
I found that these students,
no matter how happy they were

175
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:10,496
with their original success
of getting into the school,

176
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,296
two weeks later their brains were focused,
not on the privilege of being there,

177
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,996
nor on their philosophy or physics,

178
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,796
but on the competition, the workload,

179
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,496
the hassles, stresses, complaints.

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,696
When I first went in there, I walked
into the freshmen dining hall,

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,096
which is where my friends from Waco,
Texas, which is where I grew up --

182
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,596
I know some of you know this.

183
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,496
When they'd visit, they'd look around,

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,696
and say, "This dining hall looks like
something out of Hogwart's."

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,296
It does, because that was Hogwart's
and that's Harvard.

186
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,496
And when they see this,

187
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,796
they say, "Why do you waste your time
studying happiness at Harvard?

188
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,896
What does a Harvard student
possibly have to be unhappy about?"

189
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,396
Embedded within that question

190
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,996
is the key to understanding
the science of happiness.

191
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,696
Because what that question assumes

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,792
is that our external world
is predictive of our happiness levels,

193
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,892
when in reality, if I know everything
about your external world,

194
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,396
I can only predict 10%
of your long-term happiness.

195
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,196
90 percent of your long-term happiness
is predicted not by the external world,

196
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,411
but by the way your brain
processes the world.

197
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,496
And if we change it,

198
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,949
if we change our formula
for happiness and success,

199
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,795
we can change the way
that we can then affect reality.

200
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,796
What we found is that only 25%
of job successes are predicted by I.Q.,

201
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,796
75 percent of job successes

202
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,796
are predicted by your optimism
levels, your social support

203
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,096
and your ability to see stress
as a challenge instead of as a threat.

204
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,796
I talked to a New England boarding school,
probably the most prestigious one,

205
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,596
and they said, "We already know that.

206
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,296
So every year, instead of just teaching
our students, we have a wellness week.

207
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,596
And we're so excited. Monday night
we have the world's leading expert

208
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,496
will speak about adolescent depression.

209
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,759
Tuesday night
it's school violence and bullying.

210
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,596
Wednesday night is eating disorders.

211
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,296
Thursday night is illicit drug use.

212
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,749
And Friday night we're trying to decide
between risky sex or happiness."

213
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:46,796
(Laughter)

214
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,963
I said, "That's most people's
Friday nights."

215
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,796
(Laughter)

216
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,796
(Applause)

217
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,678
Which I'm glad you liked,
but they did not like that at all.

218
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,796
Silence on the phone.

219
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,096
And into the silence, I said,
"I'd be happy to speak at your school,

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,796
but that's not a wellness week,
that's a sickness week.

221
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,496
You've outlined all the negative
things that can happen,

222
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,196
but not talked about the positive."

223
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,996
The absence of disease is not health.

224
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,396
Here's how we get to health:

225
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,196
We need to reverse the formula
for happiness and success.

226
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,896
In the last three years,
I've traveled to 45 countries,

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,396
working with schools and companies
in the midst of an economic downturn.

228
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,496
And I found that
most companies and schools

229
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,592
follow a formula
for success, which is this:

230
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,692
If I work harder, I'll be more successful.

231
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,096
And if I'm more successful,
then I'll be happier.

232
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,896
That undergirds most
of our parenting and managing styles,

233
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,796
the way that we motivate our behavior.

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,440
And the problem is it's scientifically
broken and backwards for two reasons.

235
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,196
Every time your brain has a success,

236
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,996
you just changed the goalpost
of what success looked like.

237
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,697
You got good grades,
now you have to get better grades,

238
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:48,692
you got into a good school
and after you get into a better one,

239
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:51,293
you got a good job,
now you have to get a better job,

240
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,794
you hit your sales target,
we're going to change it.

241
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:57,695
And if happiness is on the opposite side
of success, your brain never gets there.

242
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,796
We've pushed happiness
over the cognitive horizon, as a society.

243
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,344
And that's because we think
we have to be successful,

244
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,492
then we'll be happier.

245
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,591
But our brains work in the opposite order.

246
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:09,592
If you can raise somebody's level
of positivity in the present,

247
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:12,856
then their brain experiences what we now
call a happiness advantage,

248
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,794
which is your brain at positive
performs significantly better

249
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,686
than at negative, neutral or stressed.

250
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,140
Your intelligence rises, your creativity
rises, your energy levels rise.

251
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:24,335
In fact, we've found that every single
business outcome improves.

252
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,488
Your brain at positive
is 31% more productive

253
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,822
than your brain at negative,
neutral or stressed.

254
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,222
You're 37% better at sales.

255
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,342
Doctors are 19 percent
faster, more accurate

256
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,296
at coming up with the correct diagnosis

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,996
when positive instead
of negative, neutral or stressed.

258
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,896
Which means we can reverse the formula.

259
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,696
If we can find a way of becoming
positive in the present,

260
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,768
then our brains work
even more successfully

261
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,696
as we're able to work harder,
faster and more intelligently.

262
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,796
We need to be able to reverse this formula

263
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,796
so we can start to see what our brains
are actually capable of.

264
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,096
Because dopamine, which floods
into your system when you're positive,

265
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,184
has two functions.

266
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,185
Not only does it make you happier,

267
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,786
it turns on all of the learning
centers in your brain

268
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,387
allowing you to adapt
to the world in a different way.

269
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:06,088
We've found there are ways
that you can train your brain

270
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,789
to be able to become more positive.

271
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:10,783
In just a two-minute span of time
done for 21 days in a row,

272
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,484
we can actually rewire your brain,

273
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,385
allowing your brain to actually work
more optimistically and more successfully.

274
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,286
We've done these things in research now

275
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,287
in every company that I've worked with,

276
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:23,588
getting them to write down three new
things that they're grateful for

277
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,899
for 21 days in a row,
three new things each day.

278
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,090
And at the end of that,

279
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:28,991
their brain starts to retain a pattern

280
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:32,492
of scanning the world not for
the negative, but for the positive first.

281
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:36,093
Journaling about one positive experience
you've had over the past 24 hours

282
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,676
allows your brain to relive it.

283
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,357
Exercise teaches your brain
that your behavior matters.

284
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,358
We find that meditation allows your brain

285
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,959
to get over the cultural ADHD
that we've been creating

286
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,860
by trying to do multiple tasks at once

287
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:49,361
and allows our brains
to focus on the task at hand.

288
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,662
And finally, random acts of kindness
are conscious acts of kindness.

289
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,830
We get people,
when they open up their inbox,

290
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,164
to write one positive email

291
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,865
praising or thanking somebody
in their support network.

292
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,366
And by doing these activities

293
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,067
and by training your brain
just like we train our bodies,

294
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:06,568
what we've found is we can reverse
the formula for happiness and success,

295
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,295
and in doing so, not only create
ripples of positivity,

296
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,396
but a real revolution.

297
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,496
Thank you very much.

298
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
(Applause)
