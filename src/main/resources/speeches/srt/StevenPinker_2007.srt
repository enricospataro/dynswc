1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,820
have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and have given us a new understanding of who we are,

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
where we've come from and the times we live in.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,820
of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,820
and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
and the daily horrors of Iraq.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
This has led to a common understanding of our situation,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,820
namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Here is an example

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,820
or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
We teach it to our children. We hear it on television

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,820
that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you

31
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,820
that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,

33
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
over centuries, over decades and over years,

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,820
of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
all over the world, although not homogeneously.

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
It's especially evident in the West, beginning with England

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --

40
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
from the millennium scale to the year scale --

41
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,820
to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist

45
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,820
of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Here is a graph that he put together

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,820
in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,820
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die

52
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,820
of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies

54
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die

56
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,820
only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower

58
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States

59
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,820
of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,820
during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.

62
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Also at the millennium scale, we can look

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,820
at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described

64
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,820
in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,820
one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
such as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,

68
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,820
'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male

70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man

72
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,820
kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,

74
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.

75
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,820
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.

76
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty

77
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,820
was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,

78
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,820
adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --

79
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,820
(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.

80
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Well, let's click the zoom lens

81
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout

83
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
the Middle Ages to modern times,

84
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
we know just from conventional history -- the evidence

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,820
was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
in socially sanctioned forms of violence.

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,820
For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture

88
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction

89
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,820
today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,820
your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
a hand being chopped off and so on.

92
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,820
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:

93
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
being pulled apart by horses and so on.

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,820
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:

96
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,820
criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,

97
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example

99
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
was the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted

100
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,820
and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,

102
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
was burned to death.

103
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,

104
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,820
because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,820
The criminologist Manuel Eisner

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
scoured all of the historical records across Europe

107
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,820
for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county

108
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
that he could find, and he supplemented them

109
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,820
He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths

111
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,820
per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate

112
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,820
of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down

113
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year

114
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick

115
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,820
in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.

117
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude

118
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,

119
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.

120
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
Let's click down now to the decade scale.

121
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
According to non-governmental organizations

122
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,820
that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,

123
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,

124
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,820
in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,

125
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,820
even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline

126
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,820
in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number

127
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,820
of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.

128
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,820
And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths

129
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,820
per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths

130
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,820
per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.

131
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.

132
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,

133
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,820
fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --

134
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.

135
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see

136
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,

137
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
then it soared upward for several decades, and began

138
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
a precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back

139
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.

140
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.

141
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
(Laughter)

142
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
So the question is, why are so many people so wrong

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,820
about something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.

144
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press

145
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,820
is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth

146
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,820
than sixteenth-century monks were.

147
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,820
There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is

148
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
to recall specific instances of something,

149
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
the higher the probability that you assign to it.

150
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage

151
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,820
burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying

152
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,820
in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion

153
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,820
and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates

154
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
and donors by saying

155
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
things just seem to be getting better and better.

156
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
(Laughter)

157
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples

158
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge

159
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
there could be anything good about Western culture.

160
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And of course, our change in standards can outpace the change

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down

162
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.

163
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
That's a process that seems to be continuing,

164
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,820
but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,

165
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
things always look more barbaric than they would have been

166
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,820
by historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --

167
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,820
if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection

168
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
in Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider

169
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
that a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned

170
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial

171
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated

172
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,820
over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment

173
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink,

174
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
rather than how high our standards have risen.

175
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,

176
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,

177
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe

178
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said

179
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,820
that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish

180
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,820
and short." Not because, he argued,

181
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
humans have some primordial thirst for blood

182
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,

183
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,

184
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,820
there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,

185
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling

186
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling

187
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol

188
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.

189
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.

190
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Now, each one of them is thinking,

191
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,820
"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.

192
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,

193
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,

194
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him

195
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
before he kills me." And so on.

196
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,

197
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.

198
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.

199
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,820
You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy

200
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.

201
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
The only thing is that it's

202
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,820
liable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work

203
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
if it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults

204
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,820
and settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.

205
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,

206
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use

207
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,820
of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --

208
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,

209
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
because any kind of aggression will be punished,

210
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,820
leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation

211
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.

212
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,820
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation

213
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead

214
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,820
to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates

215
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
that you failed to see in the earlier slide --

216
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,820
coincided with the rise of centralized states.

218
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.

219
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence

220
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,

221
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,820
frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.

222
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
The second explanation is that in many times and places,

223
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.

224
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,820
In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common

225
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,820
in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them

226
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,820
on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life

227
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.

228
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.

229
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,820
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,

230
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,820
and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist

231
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,

232
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties

233
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,820
in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade

234
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,820
their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties

235
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend

236
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
that results in them not having to fight the whole time.

237
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Wright argues that technology has increased the number

238
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,820
of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,

239
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas

240
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
over longer distances and among larger groups of people.

241
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,

242
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,820
and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,

243
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb

244
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
the Japanese is that they built my mini-van."

245
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
(Laughter)

246
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book

247
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
called "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,

248
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense

249
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,820
of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests

250
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,820
as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default

251
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,820
we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.

252
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,

253
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,820
and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,

254
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,820
the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,

255
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,

256
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,

257
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend

258
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,820
to other sentient species. The question is,

259
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
if this has happened, what has powered that expansion?

260
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles

261
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.

262
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,820
The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact

263
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable

264
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,820
to privilege your interests over theirs,

265
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say

266
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
that my interests are special compared to yours,

267
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
anymore than you can say that the particular spot

268
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe

269
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
because I happen to be standing on it that very minute.

270
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,820
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,

271
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,820
and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,

272
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,820
and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives

273
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,

274
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station

275
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I."

276
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,

277
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,820
has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why

278
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
is there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,

279
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,820
what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?

280
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Because we have been doing something right,

281
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
and it sure would be good to find out what it is.

282
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Thank you very much.

283
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:04,820
(Applause).

284
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say

285
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,820
that that expansion of -- that you were talking about,

286
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,

287
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,820
by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world

288
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?

289
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,

290
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation

291
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us

292
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read

293
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,

294
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
how could they possibly have done it,

295
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
how could they have not have empathized with the person

296
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
that they're disemboweling? But clearly,

297
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being

298
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,

299
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
that makes it easier to imagine trading places

300
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration

301
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
to that other person.

302
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk

303
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.

304
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
SP: My pleasure.
