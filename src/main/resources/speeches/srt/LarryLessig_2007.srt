1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,820
(Applause)

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
that's going to tell you a little bit

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,820
about how we open user-generated content up for business.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,820
So, here's the first story.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,820
1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,820
the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
what he called the, quote, "talking machines."

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,820
This is what he had to say.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,820
"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
of music in this country.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,820
When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
you would find young people together

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,820
as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
This is a picture of culture.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,820
We could describe it using modern computer terminology

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
as a kind of read-write culture.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
It's a culture where people participate in the creation

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,820
and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,820
because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,820
And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
what we could call read-only culture.

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Culture where creativity was consumed

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
but the consumer is not a creator.

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
A culture which is top-down, owned,

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,820
where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,820
at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Never before in the history of human culture

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,820
had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Never before has creativity of the millions

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
been as effectively displaced,

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."

43
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
The twentieth century was that century

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
where, at least for those places we know the best,

45
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,820
culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
So, second. Land is a kind of property --

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,820
it is property. It's protected by law.

48
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,820
As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
for most of the history of trespass law,

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,820
by presuming it protects the land all the way down below

51
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,820
and to an indefinite extent upward.

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Now, that was a pretty good system

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
for most of the history of the regulation of land,

54
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,820
until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,

55
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
were these instruments trespassers

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
as they flew over land without clearing the rights

57
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
of the farms below as they traveled across the country?

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.

59
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
had a significant complaint because of these technologies.

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
The complaint was that their

62
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes

63
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,820
and flew themselves into the walls of the barn

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
when the airplanes flew over the land.

65
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
to say these airplanes were trespassing.

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Since time immemorial, the law had said,

68
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,820
you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,

69
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
so this flight must stop.

70
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition

71
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,

72
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
that the Causbys must lose.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,820
all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
otherwise every transcontinental flight would

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
subject the operator to countless trespass suits.

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --

78
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,820
(Laughter) --

79
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Revolts at the idea. Common sense.

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:03,820
Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terror

81
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
to rain down on the content industry

82
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,820
was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:

83
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
a new way to spread content,

84
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,820
and therefore a new battle over the control

85
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,820
of the businesses that would spread content.

86
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
Now, at that time, the entity,

87
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights

88
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,820
for most of the music that would be broadcast

89
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
using these technologies was ASCAP.

90
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,820
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,

91
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,820
and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate

92
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
to the broadcasters who really was in charge.

93
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,820
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
until the broadcasters finally got together

95
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
and said, okay, enough of this.

96
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something

97
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,820
called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.

98
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
And BMI was much more democratic in the art

99
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
that it would include within its repertoire,

100
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.

101
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,820
But most important was that BMI took public domain works

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,820
and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free

103
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,820
to their subscribers. So that in 1940,

104
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,820
when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.

106
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.

107
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,820
The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
was no longer available, because they had shifted

109
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,820
to the second best public domain provided by BMI.

110
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
And the important point to recognize

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,820
is that even though these broadcasters

113
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
were broadcasting something you would call second best,

114
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,820
that competition was enough to break, at that time,

115
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,820
this legal cartel over access to music.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.

117
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
In my view, the most significant thing to recognize

118
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
about what this Internet is doing

119
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,820
is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture

120
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
that Sousa romanticized.

121
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Digital technology is the opportunity

122
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
for the revival of these vocal chords

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,820
that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.

124
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,820
User-generated content, spreading in businesses

125
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
in extraordinarily valuable ways like these,

126
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
celebrating amateur culture.

127
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
By which I don't mean amateurish culture,

128
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
I mean culture where people produce

129
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
for the love of what they're doing and not for the money.

130
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,820
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.

131
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
For when you think of what Sousa romanticized

132
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,

133
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
of the old songs, you should recognize

134
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
what your kids are doing right now.

135
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Taking the songs of the day and the old songs

136
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,820
and remixing them to make them something different.

137
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
It's how they understand access to this culture.

138
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
So, let's have some very few examples

139
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
to get a sense of what I'm talking about here.

140
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,

141
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
taking anime captured from television

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
re-edited to music tracks.

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:09:17,820
(Music)

144
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,820
This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.

145
00:09:22,820 --> 00:10:07,820
(Music)

146
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:15,820
(Laughter)

147
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
And this is the best.

148
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
(Music)

149
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
My love ...

150
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,820
There's only you in my life ...

151
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,820
The only thing that's bright ...

152
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
My first love ...

153
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,820
You're every breath that I take ...

154
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,820
You're every step I make ...

155
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,820
And I ....

156
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:08,820
I want to share all my love with you ...

157
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,820
No one else will do ...

158
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
And your eyes ...

159
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,820
They tell me how much you care ...

160
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
(Music)

161
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
So, this is remix, right?

162
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,820
(Applause)

163
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
And it's important to emphasize that what this is not

164
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
is not what we call, quote, "piracy."

165
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I'm not talking about nor justifying

166
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
people taking other people's content in wholesale

167
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.

168
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
I'm talking about people taking and recreating

169
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
using other people's content, using digital technologies

170
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
to say things differently.

171
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Now, the importance of this

172
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
is not the technique that you've seen here.

173
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here

174
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
is something that television and film producers

175
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
have been able to do for the last 50 years.

176
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,820
The importance is that that technique has been democratized.

177
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer

178
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
who can take sounds and images from the culture around us

179
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
and use it to say things differently.

180
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,820
These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.

181
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,820
It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.

182
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,820
It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are

183
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,820
as they increasingly understand digital technologies

184
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
and their relationship to themselves.

185
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,

186
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
the law has not greeted this Sousa revival

187
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
with very much common sense.

188
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Instead, the architecture of copyright law

189
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
and the architecture of digital technologies,

190
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
as they interact, have produced the presumption

191
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
that these activities are illegal.

192
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,

193
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape

194
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,820
is that every single use of culture produces a copy.

195
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Every single use therefore requires permission;

196
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
without permission, you are a trespasser.

197
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
You're a trespasser with about as much sense

198
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,820
as these people were trespassers.

199
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Common sense here, though, has not yet revolted

200
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
in response to this response that the law has offered

201
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
to these forms of creativity.

202
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Instead, what we've seen

203
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
is something much worse than a revolt.

204
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,820
There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides

205
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
in this debate, in response to this conflict

206
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
between the law and the use of these technologies.

207
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,820
One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced

208
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
that will enable them

209
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
to automatically take down from sites like YouTube

210
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
any content that has any copyrighted content in it,

211
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
whether or not there's a judgment of fair use

212
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
that might be applied to the use of that content.

213
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
And on the other side, among our kids,

214
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
there's a growing copyright abolitionism,

215
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
a generation that rejects the very notion

216
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright

217
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass

218
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,820
to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.

219
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,820
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,

220
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,820
a fact we should have learned many, many times over,

221
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.

222
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
Now, the balance that I try to fight for,

223
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
I, as any good liberal, try to fight for first

224
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,820
by looking to the government. Total mistake, right?

225
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
(Laughter)

226
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them

227
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
to do something to make the system make more sense.

228
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,820
It failed partly because the courts are too passive,

229
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
partly because the legislatures are corrupted,

230
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
by which I don't mean that there's bribery

231
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
operating to stop real change,

232
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions

233
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,820
means that policymakers here will not understand this

234
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
until it's too late to fix it.

235
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.

236
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,

237
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,

238
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
and to realize the economic potential of that,

239
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.

240
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here

241
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,820
can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.

242
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,

243
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
so instead what we need is two types of changes.

244
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,820
First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,

245
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,820
choose that their work be made available more freely.

246
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
So, for example, they can say their work is available freely

247
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
for non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,

248
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
but not freely for any commercial use.

249
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
And second, we need the businesses

250
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
that are building out this read-write culture

251
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,820
to embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,

252
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,820
so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,

253
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
can grow on a neutral platform

254
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
where they both exist simultaneously,

255
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,820
so that more-free can compete with less-free,

256
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,820
and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition

257
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
can teach one the lessons of the other.

258
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Now, I would talk about one particular such plan

259
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
that I know something about,

260
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,

261
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
so I'm not going to talk about this at all.

262
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.

263
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,820
That artist choice is the key for new technology

264
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
having an opportunity to be open for business,

265
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
and we need to build artist choice here

266
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
if these new technologies are to have that opportunity.

267
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,820
But let me end with something I think much more important --

268
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
much more important than business.

269
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
It's the point about how this connects to our kids.

270
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,820
We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?

271
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
(Laughter)

272
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
We made mixed tapes; they remix music.

273
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
We watched TV; they make TV.

274
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
It is technology that has made them different,

275
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
and as we see what this technology can do,

276
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
we need to recognize you can't kill

277
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,820
the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.

278
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
We can't stop our kids from using it.

279
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
We can only drive it underground.

280
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
We can't make our kids passive again.

281
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,820
We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?

282
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,820
We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,

283
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
where in many areas of our life,

284
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
we live life constantly against the law.

285
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Ordinary people live life against the law,

286
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.

287
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,820
They live life knowing they live it against the law.

288
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,820
That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,

289
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
extraordinarily corrupting.

290
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,820
And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.

291
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.

292
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Thank you very much.

293
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,820
(Applause)
