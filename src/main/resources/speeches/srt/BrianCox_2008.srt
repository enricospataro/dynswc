1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
from 85 countries around the world

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
have come together over several decades

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
to build this machine.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
What we do is we accelerate protons --

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
so, hydrogen nuclei --

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,820
around 99.999999

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
percent the speed of light.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Right? At that speed, they go around

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,820
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
And we collide them with another beam of protons

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
going in the opposite direction.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
We collide them inside giant detectors.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
They're essentially digital cameras.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
You get some sense of the size --

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
you can just see these EU standard-size

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
people underneath.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
(Laughter)

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And we re-create the conditions that were present

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
up to 600 million times a second

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
inside that detector -- immense numbers.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And if you see those metal bits there --

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
those are huge magnets that bend

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
electrically charged particles,

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
so it can measure how fast they're traveling.

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
This is a picture about a year ago.

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
Those magnets are in there.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
so you get some sense of the scale.

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
sometime in the summer this year.

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
And actually, this morning, I got an email

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
saying that we've just finished, today,

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
building the last piece of ATLAS.

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
that I planned that for TED,

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,820
(Applause)

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
So, you might be asking, "Why?

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
Why create the conditions that were present

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
And the aim of particle physics is to understand

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
And by everything I mean, of course,

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
me and you, the Earth, the Sun,

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
the 100 billion suns in our galaxy

56
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
and the 100 billion galaxies

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
in the observable universe.

58
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Absolutely everything.

59
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
Well, we found that as you look back in time,

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
the universe gets hotter and hotter,

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,

65
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
but that seems to be the case.

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
So, way back in the early times of the universe,

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
we believe it was very simple and understandable.

68
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --

69
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
human brains -- are a property of an old

70
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
and cold and complicated universe.

71
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
It's almost like ...

74
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
imagine a snowflake in your hand,

75
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,

76
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
beautiful object. But as you heat it up,

77
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
it'll melt into a pool of water,

78
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
of H20, water.

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time

81
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
to understand what the universe is made of.

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
And, as of today, it's made of these things.

83
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Just 12 particles of matter,

84
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
stuck together by four forces of nature.

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
The electron -- the thing that goes around

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
the atomic nucleus --

89
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force

90
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
that's carried by this thing, the photon.

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.

92
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,

93
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
probably the least familiar.

94
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities

96
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.

97
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
about a square centimeter --

99
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
from the sun, passing

101
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
through every square centimeter of your body.

102
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
But you don't feel them, because the weak force

103
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
is correctly named --

104
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
very short range and very weak,

105
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
so they just fly through you.

106
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And these particles have been discovered

107
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
over the last century, pretty much.

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,

109
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,

110
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
in the year 2000. Actually just --

111
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
America, isn't it?

113
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Just up the road.

114
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
(Laughter)

116
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,

117
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
so it's a relatively recent picture.

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,

119
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.

120
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
You know, they're a step in size

121
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
from the entire observable universe.

122
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
So, 100 billion galaxies,

123
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
13.7 billion light years away --

124
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,

125
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
is about the same as from Monterey to these things.

126
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Absolutely, exquisitely minute,

127
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.

128
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
So, one of my most illustrious forebears

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,

130
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
discoverer of the atomic nucleus,

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
once said, "All science is either physics

132
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
or stamp collecting."

133
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Now, I don't think he meant to insult

134
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
the rest of science,

135
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
(Laughter)

137
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
But what he meant was that what we've done, really,

138
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
is stamp collect there.

139
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
OK, we've discovered the particles,

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
but unless you understand the underlying

141
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,820
really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.

143
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Fortunately, we have

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century

145
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
that underpins that pattern.

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
It's the Newton's laws, if you want,

147
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
of particle physics.

148
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.

149
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,

150
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,820
which is always the sign of elegance.

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
This is it.

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
(Laughter)

153
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out

154
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
in all its gory detail.

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --

156
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.

157
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
in principle, you've got a big enough computer --

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
why DNA is the shape it is.

160
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.

161
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
But there's a problem.

162
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Can anyone see what it is?

163
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.

164
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.

165
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Basically, each of these terms

166
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
refers to some of the particles.

167
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.

168
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.

169
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.

170
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Right, H.

171
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
H stands for Higgs particle.

172
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Higgs particles have not been discovered.

173
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
But they're necessary: they're necessary

174
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
to make that mathematics work.

175
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do

176
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
with that wonderful equation

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.

178
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
So it's a prediction:

179
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
a prediction of a new particle.

180
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
What does it do?

181
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.

182
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money

183
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
for the LHC from the U.K. government,

184
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,

185
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
"If you guys can explain, in language

186
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
a politician can understand,

187
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.

188
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."

189
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.

190
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.

191
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
And the picture is that the whole universe --

192
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --

193
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.

194
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Higgs particles, if you will.

195
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
The analogy is that these people in a room

196
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
are the Higgs particles.

197
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Now when a particle moves through the universe,

198
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
it can interact with these Higgs particles.

199
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.

202
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
And imagine someone incredibly important

203
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
and popular and intelligent

204
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
walks into the room.

205
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.

206
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.

207
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.

208
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks

209
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
in your body and in the universe that we see around us

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
are heavy, in a sense, and massive,

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.

212
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
They're interacting with the Higgs field.

213
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
If that picture's true,

214
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.

215
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,

216
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --

217
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
we know have to turn up

219
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
at the LHC.

220
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.

221
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.

222
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --

223
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
(Laughter)

224
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
anyway.

225
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
So that's one thing.

226
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.

227
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
There are many other things. You've heard

228
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
many of the big problems in particle physics.

229
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.

230
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
There's another issue,

231
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
seem, as you go back in time,

233
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
they seem to change in strength.

234
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Well, they do change in strength.

235
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,

236
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,

238
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --

239
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,

240
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
the three forces, other than gravity,

241
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
almost seem to come together at one point.

242
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
It's almost as if there was one beautiful

243
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.

244
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
But they just miss.

245
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry,

246
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,

247
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.

248
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
But actually, with this theory,

249
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
we find that the forces of nature

250
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --

251
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,

252
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
but it seems to do it.

253
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Also, those super-symmetric particles

254
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
are very strong candidates for the dark matter.

255
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
So a very compelling theory

256
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
that's really mainstream physics.

257
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --

258
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
in a very unscientific way -- that

259
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
that these things would also crop up at the LHC.

260
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Many other things that the LHC could discover.

261
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you

262
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
a different perspective

263
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
of what I think -- what particle physics

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
narrative -- almost a creation story,

267
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
if you'd like -- about the universe,

268
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
from modern science over the last few decades.

269
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
And I'd say that it deserves,

270
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,

271
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories

272
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.

273
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.

274
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
The story goes like this: we know that

275
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,

276
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
in an immensely hot, dense state,

277
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
much smaller than a single atom.

278
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
It began to expand about

279
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
a million, billion, billion, billion billionth

280
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,820
of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.

281
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Gravity separated away from the other forces.

282
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
The universe then underwent

283
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
an exponential expansion called inflation.

284
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
In about the first billionth of a second or so,

285
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks

286
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
and the gluons and the electrons

287
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
that make us up got mass.

288
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
The universe continued to expand and cool.

289
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
After about a few minutes,

290
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.

291
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,

292
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
25 percent helium. It still is today.

293
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
It continued to expand

294
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
about 300 million years.

295
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Then light began to travel through the universe.

296
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
It was big enough to be transparent to light,

297
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background

298
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
that George Smoot described

299
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
as looking at the face of God.

300
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,

301
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook

302
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
into the heavier elements.

303
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
So the elements of life --

304
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
carbon, and oxygen and iron,

305
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
all the elements that we need to make us up --

306
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
were cooked in those first generations of stars,

307
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
which then ran out of fuel, exploded,

308
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
threw those elements back into the universe.

309
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
They then re-collapsed into another generation

310
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
of stars and planets.

311
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created

312
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen

313
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
to form water, liquid water on the surface.

314
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,

315
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
primitive life evolved,

316
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
which evolved over millions of years into

317
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
things that walked upright and left footprints

318
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,

319
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
and eventually

320
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
left a footprint on another world.

321
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
And built this civilization,

322
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
this wonderful picture,

323
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
that turned the darkness into light,

324
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
and you can see the civilization from space.

325
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,

326
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
these are the things -- and actually, not only these,

327
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
but I was looking around -- these are the things,

328
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,

329
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
and DNA, and literature and science --

330
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
these are the things that hydrogen atoms do

331
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
when given 13.7 billion years.

332
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Absolutely remarkable.

333
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
And, the laws of physics. Right?

334
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
So, the right laws of physics --

335
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
they're beautifully balanced.

336
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
If the weak force had been a little bit different,

337
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable

338
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
inside the hearts of stars,

339
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
and there would be none of that in the universe.

340
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And I think that's

341
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
a wonderful and significant story.

342
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,

343
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
because we didn't know it.

344
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
It makes me really feel that

345
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
that civilization --

346
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
which, as I say, if you believe

347
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
the scientific creation story,

348
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,

349
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and a few hydrogen atoms --

350
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
then I think, to me anyway,

351
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

352
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
So that's the LHC.

353
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,

354
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
going to write the next chapter of that book.

355
