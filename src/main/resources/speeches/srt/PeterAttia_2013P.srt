1
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,644
I'll never forget that day

2
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:17,543
back in the spring of 2006.

3
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:19,122
I was a surgical resident

4
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:21,553
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,

5
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,330
taking emergency call.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,693
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,720
to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,514
on her foot.

9
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:34,215
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh

10
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:37,842
as I pulled the curtain back to see her.

11
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:40,187
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick

12
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:41,539
and she needed to be in the hospital.

13
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,139
That wasn't being asked.

14
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:45,281
The question that was being asked of me was a different one,

15
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:49,210
which was, did she also need an amputation?

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,177
Now, looking back on that night,

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:57,342
I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman

18
00:00:57,342 --> 00:01:00,478
on that night with the same empathy and compassion

19
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:04,713
I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed

20
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:06,658
who came to the E.R. three nights earlier

21
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:08,272
with lower back pain

22
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:12,521
that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

23
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,684
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do

24
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:16,452
that was actually going to save her life.

25
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,501
The cancer was too advanced.

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,181
But I was committed to making sure that

27
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,604
I could do anything possible to make her stay

28
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:26,027
more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket

29
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,747
and a cup of a coffee.

30
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:30,932
I brought some for her parents.

31
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:34,078
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,

32
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,975
because obviously she had done nothing

33
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,149
to bring this on herself.

34
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,962
So why was it that, just a few nights later,

35
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:44,120
as I stood in that same E.R. and determined

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,531
that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,

37
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,435
why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?

38
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:53,900
You see, unlike the woman the night before,

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,299
this woman had type 2 diabetes.

40
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,851
She was fat.

41
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,764
And we all know that's from eating too much

42
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:02,119
and not exercising enough, right?

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,803
I mean, how hard can it be?

44
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:07,164
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,

45
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:10,052
if you just tried caring even a little bit,

46
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:13,042
you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment

47
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,819
with some doctor you've never met

48
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,634
about to amputate your foot.

49
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:22,276
Why did I feel justified in judging her?

50
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,845
I'd like to say I don't know.

51
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,881
But I actually do.

52
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,212
You see, in the hubris of my youth,

53
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,316
I thought I had her all figured out.

54
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:34,146
She ate too much. She got unlucky.

55
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:37,515
She got diabetes. Case closed.

56
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:38,918
Ironically, at that time in my life,

57
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,316
I was also doing cancer research,

58
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,659
immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,

59
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:47,632
and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,

60
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,668
to challenge all assumptions

61
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:53,478
and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.

62
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:56,854
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes

63
00:02:56,854 --> 00:03:00,403
that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,

64
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:03,831
I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.

65
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:06,877
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events

66
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,462
was settled science.

67
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:12,862
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.

68
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,462
But this time, I was the patient.

69
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,293
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,

70
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,858
and following the food pyramid to the letter,

71
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,015
I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something

72
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:26,300
called metabolic syndrome.

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,284
Some of you may have heard of this.

74
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,729
I had become insulin-resistant.

75
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,178
You can think of insulin as this master hormone

76
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:38,241
that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,

77
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:40,355
whether we burn it or store it.

78
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,169
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.

79
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,345
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.

80
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:49,001
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,

81
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,681
is when your cells get increasingly resistant

82
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,194
to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.

83
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,370
Once you're insulin-resistant,

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,745
you're on your way to getting diabetes,

85
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,809
which is what happens when your pancreas

86
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:04,132
can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.

87
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,760
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,392
and an entire cascade of pathologic events

89
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:13,093
sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,

90
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:16,702
cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,

91
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:21,584
and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.

92
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:24,545
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,

93
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,722
adding and subtracting things most of you would find

94
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,802
almost assuredly shocking.

95
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,681
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.

96
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,722
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.

97
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,889
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.

98
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,933
But most important, I was left

99
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:44,782
with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:

100
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:47,231
How did this happen to me if I was supposedly

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,928
doing everything right?

102
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,963
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,

103
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:56,750
was it possible it was failing someone else?

104
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,650
And underlying these questions,

105
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,896
I became almost maniacally obsessed

106
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,623
in trying to understand the real relationship

107
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:08,253
between obesity and insulin resistance.

108
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:11,069
Now, most researchers believe obesity

109
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,461
is the cause of insulin resistance.

110
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,576
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,

111
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,468
you get people to lose weight, right?

112
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,232
You treat the obesity.

113
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:23,938
But what if we have it backwards?

114
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:27,309
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?

115
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:31,229
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,

116
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,051
the tip of a proverbial iceberg?

117
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,694
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst

118
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,913
of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.

119
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:43,127
What if obesity is a coping mechanism

120
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:46,729
for a far more sinister problem going on

121
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,211
underneath the cell?

122
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,577
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,

123
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,880
but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,591
of two metabolic evils.

125
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,610
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity

126
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,597
of our cells to partition fuel,

127
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,888
as I alluded to a moment ago,

128
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,810
taking those calories that we take in

129
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,249
and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.

130
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,891
When we become insulin-resistant,

131
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,258
the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.

132
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,386
So now, when insulin says to a cell,

133
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,431
I want you to burn more energy

134
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,866
than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,

135
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:24,298
"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."

136
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,200
And because fat cells are actually missing most of

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,002
the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,

138
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,773
it's probably the safest place to store it.

139
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:36,742
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,

140
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:40,357
the appropriate response to insulin resistance

141
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:45,286
may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,

142
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:50,630
getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.

143
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,805
This is a really subtle distinction,

144
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:56,172
but the implication could be profound.

145
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,670
Consider the following analogy:

146
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,639
Think of the bruise you get on your shin

147
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,231
when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.

148
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:08,118
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly

149
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:11,099
don't like the discolored look, but we all know

150
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,552
the bruise per Se is not the problem.

151
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:18,294
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,

152
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:21,055
all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury

153
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:24,039
to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread

154
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,737
of infection to elsewhere in the body.

155
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,459
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,

156
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,327
and we evolved a giant medical establishment

157
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,467
and a culture around treating bruises:

158
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,750
masking creams, painkillers, you name it,

159
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,976
all the while ignoring the fact that people

160
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:45,596
are still banging their shins into coffee tables.

161
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:48,799
How much better would we be if we treated the cause --

162
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,364
telling people to pay attention

163
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:51,967
when they walk through the living room --

164
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:55,240
rather than the effect?

165
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,117
Getting the cause and the effect right

166
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,596
makes all the difference in the world.

167
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:02,675
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry

168
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,355
can still do very well for its shareholders

169
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:09,271
but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.

170
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:12,115
Cause and effect.

171
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,952
So what I'm suggesting is

172
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,709
maybe we have the cause and effect wrong

173
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,343
on obesity and insulin resistance.

174
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,120
Maybe we should be asking ourselves,

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,005
is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain

176
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,071
and the diseases associated with obesity,

177
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,601
at least in most people?

178
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,601
What if being obese is just a metabolic response

179
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,822
to something much more threatening,

180
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,033
an underlying epidemic,

181
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,590
the one we ought to be worried about?

182
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,062
Let's look at some suggestive facts.

183
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,548
We know that 30 million obese Americans

184
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,521
in the United States don't have insulin resistance.

185
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,458
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any

186
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,538
greater risk of disease than lean people.

187
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,422
Conversely, we know that six million lean people

188
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:56,859
in the United States are insulin-resistant,

189
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,926
and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk

190
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,081
for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago

191
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,903
than their obese counterparts.

192
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:06,140
Now I don't know why, but it might be because,

193
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,830
in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out

194
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,115
the right thing to do with that excess energy.

195
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:15,434
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,

196
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:17,305
and you can be lean and have it,

197
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:21,738
this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy

198
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,762
for what's going on.

199
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,177
So what if we're fighting the wrong war,

200
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:30,977
fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?

201
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:34,220
Even worse, what if blaming the obese

202
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,945
means we're blaming the victims?

203
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:40,664
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity

204
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,522
are just wrong?

205
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:46,645
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,

206
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:49,228
let alone the luxury of certainty.

207
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:52,074
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,

208
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,986
but I'm wide open to others.

209
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:56,705
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,

210
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,322
is this.

211
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:01,451
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from

212
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,178
when it becomes insulin resistant,

213
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:05,853
the answer probably isn't too much food.

214
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:09,503
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.

215
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,797
Now, we know that refined grains and starches

216
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:13,853
elevate your blood sugar in the short run,

217
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,761
and there's even reason to believe that sugar

218
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,562
may lead to insulin resistance directly.

219
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:22,657
So if you put these physiological processes to work,

220
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:26,130
I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake

221
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,993
of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving

222
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:33,644
this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,

223
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,482
but through insulin resistance,

224
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:39,394
you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.

225
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,979
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,

226
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,579
I did it simply by restricting those things,

227
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,035
which admittedly suggests I have a bias

228
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:50,396
based on my personal experience.

229
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,051
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,

230
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:57,004
and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.

231
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:00,111
But step one is accepting the possibility

232
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:02,483
that our current beliefs about obesity,

233
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:05,489
diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong

234
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,364
and therefore must be tested.

235
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,755
I'm betting my career on this.

236
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:14,880
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,053
and I'll go wherever the science takes me.

238
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,584
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore

239
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:24,628
is pretend I have the answers when I don't.

240
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:28,736
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.

241
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,893
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough

242
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:34,306
to work on this problem with the most amazing team

243
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:37,710
of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,

244
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,015
and the best part is,

245
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,914
just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,

246
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,410
we've done the same thing.

247
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,673
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,

248
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,118
the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses

249
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:52,732
for what's at the heart of this epidemic.

250
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:55,113
Some think it's too many calories consumed.

251
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,492
Others think it's too much dietary fat.

252
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:00,962
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.

253
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:03,570
But this team of multi-disciplinary,

254
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,554
highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers

255
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:08,842
do agree on two things.

256
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:12,491
First, this problem is just simply too important

257
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:15,234
to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.

258
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,018
And two, if we're willing to be wrong,

259
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:20,555
if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom

260
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:23,618
with the best experiments science can offer,

261
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,923
we can solve this problem.

262
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:28,978
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,

263
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:33,475
some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --

264
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,204
eat this, not that —

265
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:36,884
but if we want to get it right,

266
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,118
we're going to have to do much more rigorous science

267
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:41,971
before we can write that prescription.

268
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,570
Briefly, to address this, our research program

269
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,813
is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.

270
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:50,708
First, how do the various foods we consume

271
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,509
impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,

272
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,327
and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?

273
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,577
Second, based on these insights,

274
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,536
can people make the necessary changes in their diets

275
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:05,267
in a way that's safe and practical to implement?

276
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:08,276
And finally, once we identify what safe

277
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:11,304
and practical changes people can make to their diet,

278
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:14,979
how can we move their behavior in that direction

279
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,232
so that it becomes more the default

280
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:19,088
rather than the exception?

281
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:21,508
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean

282
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,017
you're always going to do it.

283
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,145
Sometimes we have to put cues around people

284
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,448
to make it easier, and believe it or not,

285
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:31,089
that can be studied scientifically.

286
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,673
I don't know how this journey is going to end,

287
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:37,886
but this much seems clear to me, at least:

288
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:42,882
We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients

289
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,794
like I did.

290
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:48,073
Most of them actually want to do the right thing,

291
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:51,442
but they have to know what that is,

292
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,488
and it's got to work.

293
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:59,184
I dream of a day when our patients can

294
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:00,919
shed their excess pounds

295
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,732
and cure themselves of insulin resistance,

296
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,462
because as medical professionals,

297
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:08,432
we've shed our excess mental baggage

298
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,758
and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently

299
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:14,848
to go back to our original ideals:

300
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:19,265
open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas

301
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,593
when they don't appear to be working,

302
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:25,712
and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,

303
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:28,460
but constantly evolving.

304
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,752
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients

305
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:35,000
and better for science.

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,994
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy

307
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:39,920
for metabolic illness,

308
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,217
what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?

309
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,761
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.

310
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,074
seven years ago.

311
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:55,698
I wish I could speak with that woman again.

312
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,953
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.

313
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:01,840
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered

314
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,500
the best clinical care I could,

315
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,397
but as a human being,

316
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:11,805
I let you down.

317
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:16,050
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.

318
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,548
You needed my empathy and compassion,

319
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,543
and above all else, you needed a doctor

320
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,172
who was willing to consider

321
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:28,236
maybe you didn't let the system down.

322
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:31,454
Maybe the system, of which I was a part,

323
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,893
was letting you down.

324
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:36,694
If you're watching this now,

325
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:40,932
I hope you can forgive me.

326
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:44,932
(Applause)
