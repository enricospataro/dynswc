1
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:16,998
On Mondays and Thursdays,
I learn how to die.

2
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,922
I call them my terminal days.

3
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,756
My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,

4
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:26,558
but a lot of people in my family died
of melanoma cancer

5
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,193
and my parents and grandparents had it.

6
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:32,477
And I kept thinking, one day I could
be sitting in front of a doctor

7
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:34,599
who looks at my exams and says,

8
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,914
"Ricardo, things don't look very good.

9
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:39,593
You have six months or a year to live."

10
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:42,839
And you start thinking about
what you would do with this time.

11
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:45,634
And you say, "I'm going to spend 
more time with the kids.

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,216
I'm going to visit these places,

13
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:49,698
I'm going to go up and down
mountains and places

14
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:53,522
and I'm going to do all the things
I didn't do when I had the time."

15
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,459
But of course, we all know

16
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,443
these are very bittersweet memories 
we're going to have.

17
00:00:58,443 --> 00:00:59,766
It's very difficult to do.

18
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:03,419
You spend a good part of the time
crying, probably.

19
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:05,806
So I said, I'm going to do something else.

20
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:10,645
Every Monday and Thursday,
I'm going use my terminal days.

21
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,014
And I will do, during those days,

22
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:16,541
whatever it is I was going to do
if I had received that piece of news.

23
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,914
(Laughter)

24
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:19,948
When you think about --

25
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:24,113
(Applause)

26
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:26,590
when you think about the opposite of work,

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,067
we, many times, think it's leisure.

28
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:32,134
And you say, ah, I need 
some leisure time, and so forth.

29
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,671
But the fact is that,
leisure is a very busy thing.

30
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,070
You go play golf and tennis,
and you meet people,

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,180
and you're going for lunch,
and you're late for the movies.

32
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,230
It's a very crowded thing that we do.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,350
The opposite of work is idleness.

34
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,765
But very few of us know
what to do with idleness.

35
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:53,822
When you look at the way
that we distribute our lives in general,

36
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:58,381
you realize that in the periods
in which we have a lot of money,

37
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,378
we have very little time.

38
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:05,405
And then when we finally have time,
we have neither the money nor the health.

39
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:10,025
So we started thinking about that
as a company for the last 30 years.

40
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,196
This is a complicated company
with thousands of employees,

41
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,556
hundreds of millions
of dollars of business

42
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:22,109
that makes rocket fuel propellent systems,
runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,

43
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,466
does income tax preparation
for dozens of thousands.

44
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:29,078
So this is not a simple business.

45
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,206
We looked at it and we said,

46
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:36,074
let's devolve to these people,
let's give these people a company

47
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,454
where we take away
all the boarding school aspects

48
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,843
of, this is when you arrive,
this is how you dress,

49
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,405
this is how you go to meetings,
this is what you say,

50
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,726
this is what you don't say,

51
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,232
and let's see what's left.

52
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,062
So we started this about 30 years ago,

53
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:50,587
and we started dealing
with this very issue.

54
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,784
And so we said, look, the retirement,

55
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:55,926
the whole issue of how 
we distribute our graph of life.

56
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,083
Instead of going mountain climbing
when you're 82,

57
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,256
why don't you do it next week?

58
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,611
And we'll do it like this,

59
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:07,007
we'll sell you back your Wednesdays
for 10 percent of your salary.

60
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:11,260
So now, if you were going to be 
a violinist, which you probably weren't,

61
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,414
you go and do this on Wednesday.

62
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:14,761
And what we found --

63
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,298
we thought, these are the older people

64
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,897
who are going to be really interested
in this program.

65
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:22,351
And the average age
of the first people who adhered

66
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,799
were 29, of course.

67
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,157
And so we started looking,

68
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:27,657
and we said, we have to do things
in a different way.

69
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,428
So we started saying things like,

70
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,802
why do we want to know
what time you came to work,

71
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,053
what time you left, etc.?

72
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,407
Can't we exchange this for a contract

73
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,869
for buying something from you,
some kind of work?

74
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,890
Why are we building these headquarters?

75
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,658
Is it not an ego issue
that we want to look solid

76
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,537
and big and important?

77
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:48,821
But we're dragging you two hours
across town because of it?

78
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:52,352
So we started asking questions one by one.

79
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,745
We'd say it like this:

80
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:56,027
One: How do we find people?

81
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,210
We'd go out and try
and recruit people and we'd say,

82
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,763
look, when you come to us,

83
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,985
we're not going to have
two or three interviews

84
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,397
and then you're going to be
married to us for life.

85
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,547
That's not how we do 
the rest of our lives.

86
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,652
So, come have your interviews.

87
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:13,088
Anyone who's interested
in interviewing, you will show up.

88
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:17,081
And then we'll see what happens
out of the intuition that rises from that,

89
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,123
instead of just filling out the little 
items of whether you're the right person.

90
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:23,240
And then, come back.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,301
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,
talk to anybody you want.

92
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:29,362
Make sure we are the bride 
you thought we were

93
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:32,425
and not all the bullshit
we put into our own ads.

94
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:34,501
(Laughter)

95
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:38,197
Slowly we went to a process 
where we'd say things like,

96
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,958
we don't want anyone to be
a leader in the company

97
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,101
if they haven't been 
interviewed and approved

98
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,952
by their future subordinates.

99
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,829
Every six months, everyone gets 
evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.

100
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:55,440
And this determines whether they should
continue in that leadership position,

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,230
which is many times
situational, as you know.

102
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,284
And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent 
of a grade, they don't stay,

103
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,623
which is probably the reason why
I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.

104
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:12,519
And over time, we started asking
other questions.

105
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,035
We said things like,

106
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:17,364
why can't people set their own salaries?

107
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:18,940
What do they need to know?

108
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,003
There's only three things 
you need to know:

109
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,338
how much people make inside the company,

110
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:26,207
how much people make somewhere
else in a similar business

111
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,499
and how much we make in general
to see whether we can afford it.

112
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,084
So let's give people these three
pieces of information.

113
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,092
So we started having, in the cafeteria,

114
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:36,593
a computer where you could go in 
and you could ask

115
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,790
what someone spent, 
how much someone makes,

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,270
what they make in benefits, 
what the company makes,

117
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,580
what the margins are, and so forth.

118
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,342
And this is 25 years ago.

119
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:50,007
As this information started 
coming to people,

120
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:53,116
we said things like, we don't want 
to see your expense report,

121
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:55,688
we don't want to know how many 
holidays you're taking,

122
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:57,600
we don't want to know where you work.

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,576
We had, at one point,
14 different offices around town,

124
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,970
and we'd say, go to the one 
that's closest to your house,

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,471
to the customer that 
you're going to visit today.

126
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,590
Don't tell us where you are.

127
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,715
And more, even when we had
thousands of people, 5,000 people,

128
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:16,093
we had two people in the H.R. department,

129
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,491
and thankfully one of them has retired.

130
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,450
(Laughter)

131
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,204
And so, the question we were asking was,
how can we be taking care of people?

132
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,007
People are the only thing we have.

133
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:29,445
We can't have a department that runs
after people and looks after people.

134
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:34,826
So as we started finding that this worked,
and we'd say, we're looking for --

135
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,521
and this is, I think,
the main thing I was looking for

136
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,564
in the terminal days and in the company,

137
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:43,133
which is, how do you set up for wisdom?

138
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,809
We've come from an age of revolution,
industrial revolution,

139
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,492
an age of information,
an age of knowledge,

140
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:53,104
but we're not any closer
to the age of wisdom.

141
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,431
How we design, how do we organize,
for more wisdom?

142
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,974
So for example, many times,

143
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:02,321
what's the smartest or the intelligent
decision doesn't jive.

144
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,703
So we'd say things like,

145
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,710
let's agree that you're going to sell
57 widgets per week.

146
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,383
If you sell them by Wednesday, 
please go to the beach.

147
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,094
Don't create a problem for us, 
for manufacturing, for application,

148
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:19,197
then we have to buy new companies,
we have to buy our competitors,

149
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:22,419
we have to do all kinds of things
because you sold too many widgets.

150
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,655
So go to the beach
and start again on Monday.

151
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:27,091
(Laughter) (Applause)

152
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,430
So the process is looking for wisdom.

153
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,970
And in the process, of course, 
we wanted people to know everything,

154
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,339
and we wanted to be truly democratic
about the way we ran things.

155
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:43,030
So our board had two seats open 
with the same voting rights,

156
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,148
for the first two people who showed up.

157
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,716
(Laughter)

158
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,952
And so we had cleaning ladies voting
on a board meeting,

159
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:55,048
which had a lot of other very important
people in suits and ties.

160
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:58,677
And the fact is that they kept us honest.

161
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:02,426
This process, as we started looking
at the people who came to us,

162
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,004
we'd say, now wait a second,

163
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,887
people come to us and they say,
where am I supposed to sit?

164
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,127
How am I supposed to work?
Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?

165
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:13,206
And we looked at that and we said,
we have to start much earlier.

166
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,229
Where do we start?

167
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,744
We said, oh, kindergarten 
seems like a good place.

168
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:21,401
So we set up a foundation, which now has, 
for 11 years, three schools,

169
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,703
where we started asking
the same questions,

170
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,615
how do you redesign school for wisdom?

171
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:29,544
It is one thing to say,
we need to recycle the teachers,

172
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:31,218
we need the directors to do more.

173
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:37,153
But the fact is that what we do
with education is entirely obsolete.

174
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:39,651
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.

175
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:45,298
Going from a math class, to biology,
to 14th-century France is very silly.

176
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:50,004
(Applause)

177
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:52,733
So we started thinking, 
what could it look like?

178
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,302
And we put together people, 
including people who like education,

179
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:01,737
people like Paulo Freire, 
and two ministers of education in Brazil

180
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:04,406
and we said, if we were to design
a school from scratch,

181
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:05,833
what would it look like?

182
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,566
And so we created this school,
which is called Lumiar,

183
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,718
and Lumiar, one of them
is a public school,

184
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,524
and Lumiar says the following:

185
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:17,701
Let's divide this role
of the teacher into two.

186
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,062
One guy, we'll call a tutor.

187
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:25,037
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek
"paideia": Look after the kid.

188
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:28,867
What's happening at home,
what's their moment in life, etc..

189
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,207
But please don't teach,

190
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,617
because the little you know compared 
to Google, we don't want to know.

191
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:34,769
Keep that to yourself.

192
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,117
(Laughter)

193
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,070
Now, we'll bring in people
who have two things:

194
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,437
passion and expertise, and it could be
their profession or not.

195
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,354
And we use the senior citizens,

196
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:50,707
who are 25 percent of the population
with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.

197
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,314
So we bring them to school and we say,

198
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:57,150
teach these kids whatever
you really believe in.

199
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,766
So we have violinists teaching math.

200
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,331
We have all kinds of things where we say,

201
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:05,312
don't worry about 
the course material anymore.

202
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:10,276
We have approximately 10 great threads
that go from 2 to 17.

203
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,666
Things like, how do we measure
ourselves as humans?

204
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,292
So there's a place for math and physics
and all that there.

205
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,156
How do we express ourselves?

206
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:22,561
So there's a place
for music and literature, etc.,

207
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,205
but also for grammar.

208
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,862
And then we have things
that everyone has forgotten,

209
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,431
which are probably the most 
important things in life.

210
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:33,129
The very important things in life,
we know nothing about.

211
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,369
We know nothing about love,

212
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,461
we know nothing about death,

213
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:39,538
we know nothing about why we're here.

214
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:44,072
So we need a thread in school that
talks about everything we don't know.

215
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:46,176
So that's a big part of what we do.

216
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:51,771
(Applause)

217
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:54,689
So over the years, we started going
into other things.

218
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,851
We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids

219
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,642
and say, sit down and come here 
and do that, and so forth.

220
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,957
We said, let's get the kids to do 
something we call a circle,

221
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,222
which meets once a week.

222
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:06,532
And we'd say, you put the rules together

223
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,859
and then you decide
what you want to do with it.

224
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,041
So can you all hit yourself on the head?

225
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,363
Sure, for a week, try.

226
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:17,298
They came up with the very same
rules that we had,

227
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,689
except they're theirs.

228
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,934
And then, they have the power,

229
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:25,926
which means, they can and do
suspend and expel kids

230
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:31,324
so that we're not playing school,
they really decide.

231
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,367
And then, in this same vein,

232
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,761
we keep a digital mosaic,

233
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:40,392
because this is not constructivist
or Montessori or something.

234
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:43,930
It's something where we keep
the Brazilian curriculum

235
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,598
with 600 tiles of a mosaic,

236
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:49,735
which we want to expose these kids
to by the time they're 17.

237
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:52,570
And follow this all the time
and we know how they're doing

238
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,610
and we say, you're not interested 
in this now, let's wait a year.

239
00:11:56,624 --> 00:12:00,856
And the kids are in groups
that don't have an age category,

240
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,582
so the six-year-old kid
who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,

241
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,947
that eliminates all of the gangs
and the groups

242
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:10,832
and this stuff that we have 
in the schools, in general.

243
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:13,273
And they have a zero 
to 100 percent grading,

244
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:17,074
which they do themselves with an app
every couple of hours.

245
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:21,509
Until we know they're 37 percent of the
way we'd like them to be on this issue,

246
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,404
so that we can send them out in the world
with them knowing enough about it.

247
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:31,647
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,
or building a bicycle.

248
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:35,918
And people will sign up for 
a 45-day course on building a bicycle.

249
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:40,487
Now, try to build a bicycle without 
knowing that pi is 3.1416.

250
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,251
You can't.

251
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,763
And try, any one of you, 
using 3.1416 for something.

252
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,409
You don't know anymore.

253
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,840
So this is lost and that's what 
we try to do there,

254
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,954
which is looking 
for wisdom in that school.

255
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:58,514
And that brings us back to this graph
and this distribution of our life.

256
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,571
I accumulated a lot of money 
when I think about it.

257
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:05,818
When you think and you say,
now is the time to give back --

258
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,490
well, if you're giving back, 
you took too much.

259
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:15,542
(Laughter) (Applause)

260
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:19,222
I keep thinking of Warren Buffet
waking up one day

261
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,606
and finding out he has 30 billion dollars
more than he thought he had.

262
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:25,398
And he looks and he says,
what am I going to do with this?

263
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:28,235
And he says, I'll give it to someone
who really needs this.

264
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,523
I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)

265
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:35,056
And my guy, who's my financial
advisor in New York,

266
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,949
he says, look, you're a silly guy

267
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,222
because you would have 4.1 times 
more money today

268
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:44,482
if you had made money with money
instead of sharing as you go.

269
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,300
But I like sharing as you go better.

270
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,606
(Applause)

271
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:53,878
I taught MBAs at MIT for a time

272
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:56,484
and I ended up, one day,
at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

273
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,428
It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.

274
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,470
And I was walking around.
It was my birthday and I was thinking.

275
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,864
And the first time around, 
I saw these tombstones

276
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,637
and these wonderful people 
who'd done great things

277
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,519
and I thought, what do I want 
to be remembered for?

278
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,305
And I did another stroll around,

279
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,750
and the second time,
another question came to me,

280
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,053
which did me better, which was,

281
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,940
why do I want to be remembered at all?

282
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,077
(Laughter)

283
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,898
And that, I think, 
took me different places.

284
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:29,146
When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I
sat for a whole afternoon,

285
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,328
we had a big pit with fire,

286
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,904
and I threw everything I had ever 
done into that fire.

287
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:37,291
This is a book in 38 languages,

288
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,838
hundreds and hundreds of articles
and DVDs, everything there was.

289
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,258
And that did two things.

290
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:47,183
One, it freed our five kids
from following in our steps, our shadow --

291
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,839
They don't know what I do.

292
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,063
(Laughter)

293
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,372
Which is good.

294
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:53,297
And I'm not going to take them somewhere

295
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,691
and say, one day 
all of this will be yours.

296
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,248
(Laughter)

297
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:00,780
The five kids know nothing, which is good.

298
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,461
And the second thing is,

299
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:07,159
I freed myself from this anchor
of past achievement or whatever.

300
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,657
I'm free to start something new every time
and to decide things from scratch

301
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,778
in part of those terminal days.

302
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,195
And some people would say,

303
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:17,733
oh, so now you have this time,
these terminal days,

304
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,591
and so you go out and do everything.

305
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:21,913
No, we've been to the beaches,

306
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,475
so we've been to Samoa and Maldives
and Mozambique,

307
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,241
so that's done.

308
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,350
I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.

309
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,221
I've gone down 60 meters to see 
hammerhead sharks.

310
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:36,772
I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel
from Chad to Timbuktu.

311
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:40,763
I've gone to the magnetic 
North Pole on a dog sled.

312
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,539
So, we've been busy.

313
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:48,542
It's what I'd like to call 
my empty bucket list.

314
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,521
(Laughter)

315
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:55,078
And with this rationale,
I look at these days and I think,

316
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,597
I'm not retired. 
I don't feel retired at all.

317
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,738
And so I'm writing a new book.

318
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:03,551
We started three new companies
in the last two years.

319
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:08,754
I'm now working on getting this 
school system for free out into the world,

320
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:12,183
and I've found, very interestingly enough,
that nobody wants it for free.

321
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,145
And so I've been trying for 10 years

322
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:17,570
to get the public system
to take over this school rationale,

323
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,965
much as the public schools we have,

324
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:24,662
which has instead of 43 out of 100,
as their rating, as their grades,

325
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:27,351
has 91 out of 100.

326
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,784
But for free, nobody wants it.

327
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:32,978
So maybe we'll start charging for it 
and then it will go somewhere.

328
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:36,759
But getting this out is one
of the things we want to do.

329
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,076
And I think what this leaves us
as a message for all of you,

330
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,828
I think is a little bit like this:

331
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:44,985
We've all learned
how to go on Sunday night

332
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,402
to email and work from home.

333
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,112
But very few of us have learned

334
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:52,242
how to go to the movies
on Monday afternoon.

335
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:56,343
And if we're looking for wisdom,
we need to learn to do that as well.

336
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:59,993
And so, what we've done all
of these years is very simple,

337
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:03,165
is use the little tool,
which is ask three whys in a row.

338
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,926
Because the first why
you always have a good answer for.

339
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:08,341
The second why,
it starts getting difficult.

340
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:12,280
By the third why, you don't really know
why you're doing what you're doing.

341
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,508
What I want to leave you with is the seed
and the thought that maybe if you do this,

342
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,264
you will come to the question, what for?

343
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:22,766
What am I doing this for?

344
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:25,647
And hopefully, as a result of that,
and over time,

345
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,780
I hope that with this,
and that's what I'm wishing you,

346
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,483
you'll have a much wiser future.

347
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,268
Thank you very much.

348
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:40,807
(Applause)

349
00:17:45,777 --> 00:17:50,864
Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, 
you're kind of crazy.

350
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:52,689
(Laughter)

351
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,869
To many people, this seems crazy.

352
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:59,258
And yet so deeply wise, also.

353
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:02,167
The pieces I'm trying
to put together are this:

354
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,262
Your ideas are so radical.

355
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:09,311
How, in business, for example,
these ideas have been out for a while,

356
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:13,221
probably the percentage of businesses 
that have taken some of them

357
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,123
is still quite low.

358
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:18,021
Are there any times you've seen 
some big company

359
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:21,650
take on one of your ideas 
and you've gone, "Yes!"?

360
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,447
Ricardo Semler: It happens.
It happened about two weeks ago

361
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:26,657
with Richard Branson,
with his people saying,

362
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:29,189
oh, I don't want to control
your holidays anymore,

363
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,373
or Netflix does a little bit
of this and that,

364
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:33,700
but I don't think it's very important.

365
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,454
I'd like to see it happen maybe a little
bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,

366
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,028
but that's a very personal one.

367
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:43,240
But the fact is that it takes a leap 
of faith about losing control.

368
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,536
And almost nobody who is in control
is ready to take leaps of faith.

369
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:48,876
It will have to come from kids 
and other people

370
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,118
who are starting companies 
in a different way.

371
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,626
CA: So that's the key thing?

372
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,825
From your point of view
the evidence is there,

373
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,821
in the business point of view this works,

374
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:59,529
but people just don't have
the courage to -- (Whoosh)

375
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,651
RS: They don't even have the incentive.

376
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,407
You're running a company
with a 90-day mandate.

377
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,286
It's a quarterly report.

378
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,504
If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.

379
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:12,425
So you say, "Here's a great program that,
in less than one generation --"

380
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,349
And the guy says, "Get out of here."

381
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,240
So this is the problem.

382
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,155
(Laughter)

383
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:24,471
CA: What you're trying to do in education
seems to me incredibly profound.

384
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:28,969
Everyone is bothered about
their country's education system.

385
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,742
No one thinks that
we've caught up yet to a world

386
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:34,692
where there's Google and all these 
technological options.

387
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:38,562
So you've got actual evidence now that 
the kids so far going through your system,

388
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,114
there's a dramatic increase 
in performance.

389
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,679
How do we help you move
these ideas forward?

390
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,663
RS: I think it's that problem
of ideas whose time has come.

391
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,072
And I've never been very evangelical
about these things.

392
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,613
We put it out there.

393
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:55,058
Suddenly, you find people --

394
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,573
there's a group in Japan, 
which scares me very much,

395
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,738
which is called the Semlerists,
and they have 120 companies.

396
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:05,109
They've invited me.
I've always been scared to go.

397
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:10,284
And there is a group in Holland
that has 600 small, Dutch companies.

398
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,961
It's something that
will flourish on its own.

399
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,452
Part of it will be wrong, 
and it doesn't matter.

400
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,529
This will find its own place.

401
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,014
And I'm afraid
of the other one, which says,

402
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,946
this is so good you've got to do this.

403
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:24,612
Let's set up a system 
and put lots of money into it

404
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:27,139
and then people will do it no matter what.

405
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,383
CA: So you have asked 
extraordinary questions your whole life.

406
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:33,216
It seems to me that's the fuel 
that's driven a lot of this.

407
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:39,085
Do you have any other questions for us,
for TED, for this group here?

408
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:43,674
RS: I always come back 
to variations of the question

409
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:46,925
that my son asked me when he was three.

410
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:50,866
We were sitting in a jacuzzi,
and he said, "Dad, why do we exist?"

411
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,440
There is no other question.

412
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,954
Nobody has any other question.

413
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:57,943
We have variations of this one question,
from three onwards.

414
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:03,339
So when you spend time in a company,
in a bureaucracy, in an organization

415
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,962
and you're saying, boy --

416
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,679
how many people do you know
who on their death beds said,

417
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,084
boy, I wish I had spent
more time at the office?

418
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:15,134
So there's a whole thing 
of having the courage now --

419
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,042
not in a week, not in two months,

420
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,336
not when you find out 
you have something --

421
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:22,208
to say, no, what am I doing this for?

422
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,325
Stop everything. Let me do something else.

423
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,890
And it will be okay,

424
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,161
it will be much better
than what you're doing,

425
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,269
if you're stuck in a process.

426
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,471
CA: So that strikes me as a profound
and quite beautiful way to end

427
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:36,097
this penultimate day of TED.

428
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:37,775
Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.

429
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,352
RS: Thank you so much.

430
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:41,004
(Applause)
