1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
sharing some of the problems.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and making it kind of an annual thing.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
because I think there are some very important problems

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
that don't get worked on naturally.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,820
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
to do the right things.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
And only by paying attention to these things

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
can we make as much progress as we need to.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and talk about where they stand.

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,820
is to look at childhood deaths.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,820
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,820
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,820
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
It's a phenomenal thing.

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Each one of those lives matters a lot.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
but also a few key breakthroughs:

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
vaccines that were used more widely.

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
For example, measles was four million of the deaths

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
back as recently as 1990

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and now is under 400,000.

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
So we really can make changes.

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,820
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Why? Well there's only a few diseases

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,820
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

42
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,820
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?

44
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Well, what's the history of this disease?

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
it's the only disease we can see

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
that people who lived in Africa

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
So it was absolutely gigantic.

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
And the disease was all over the world.

53
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.

54
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,

55
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,820
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
So it was everywhere.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,820
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And so that's why the death rate did come down.

61
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Now, ironically, what happened was

62
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,

63
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,820
which is where the rich countries are.

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
1945, it's still most places.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.

67
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,820
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.

69
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And so this leads to the paradox that

70
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,

71
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
it doesn't get much investment.

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs

73
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
than are put into malaria.

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
(Laughter)

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
And rich men are afflicted.

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,820
And so that's why that priority has been set.

78
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
But, malaria --

79
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
greatly understate its impact.

81
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.

82
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,820
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going

83
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
because it just holds things back so much.

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,820
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.

85
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,820
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.

86
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,820
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
(Laughter)

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.

89
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,820
(Laughter) (Applause)

90
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Those mosquitos are not infected.

91
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,820
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.

92
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
And bed nets are a great tool.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,820
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.

95
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,820
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT

96
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
and those nets

97
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.

98
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
And that's happened now in a number of countries.

99
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
It's great to see.

100
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
But we have to be careful because malaria --

101
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,820
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.

103
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,820
And so you end up with two choices.

104
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,820
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,

105
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
you do it vigorously,

106
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
you can actually get a local eradication.

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,

109
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,

110
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,

111
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
and the death rate will soar back up again.

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Now we're on the upswing.

114
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Bed net funding is up.

115
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
There's new drug discovery going on.

116
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial

117
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
that starts in a couple months.

118
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.

119
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
So we're going to have these new tools.

120
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.

121
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Because the road map to get rid of this disease

122
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
involves many things.

123
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
to keep the visibility high,

125
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
to tell the success stories.

126
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
It involves social scientists,

127
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,

128
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
but 90 percent.

129
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,

130
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,820
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.

131
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.

132
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,820
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.

133
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
And so as these elements come together,

134
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm quite optimistic

135
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.

136
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Now let me turn to a second question,

137
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.

138
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?

139
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,820
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,

140
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
and we'd understand very well.

141
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
And the answer is, really, that we don't.

142
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Let's start with why this is important.

143
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.

144
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
We all had a wonderful education.

145
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
That's part of the reason we're here today,

146
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
part of the reason we're successful.

147
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.

148
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I had great teachers.

149
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,820
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.

150
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,820
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,820
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,

153
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.

154
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology

155
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.

156
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
is starting to fade on a relative basis,

158
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,820
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.

159
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.

160
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,820
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
to people with a better education.

162
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
And we have to change this.

163
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.

164
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
We have to change it so that the country is strong

165
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
and stays at the forefront

166
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
of things that are driven by advanced education,

167
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
like science and mathematics.

168
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
When I first learned the statistics,

169
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.

170
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.

171
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And that had been covered up for a long time

172
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
because they always took the dropout rate as the number

173
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,820
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.

174
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.

175
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.

176
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
They had to raise the stated dropout rate

177
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
as soon as that tracking was done

178
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
to over 30 percent.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.

180
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And even if you graduate from high school,

181
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
if you're low-income,

182
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,820
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.

183
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,820
If you're low-income in the United States,

184
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
you have a higher chance of going to jail

185
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
than you do of getting a four-year degree.

186
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.

187
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
So, how do you make education better?

188
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.

189
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
There's many people working on it.

190
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
We've worked on small schools,

191
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
we've funded scholarships,

192
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
we've done things in libraries.

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
A lot of these things had a good effect.

194
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers

195
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
was the very key thing.

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
And we hooked up with some people studying

197
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
how much variation is there between teachers,

198
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --

199
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
and the bottom quartile.

200
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?

201
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,820
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.

202
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,820
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --

203
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
based on test scores --

204
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
by over 10 percent in a single year.

205
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
What does that mean?

206
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,

207
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
had top quartile teachers,

208
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,820
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.

209
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.

210
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.

211
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,820
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.

212
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
We should retain those people.

213
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."

214
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,820
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.

215
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?

216
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
What do they look like?

217
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
You might think these must be very senior teachers.

218
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And the answer is no.

219
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Once somebody has taught for three years

220
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,820
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.

221
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
The variation is very, very small.

222
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,820
You might think these are people with master's degrees.

223
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.

224
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
This chart takes four different factors

225
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.

226
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,

227
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
is a master's degree.

228
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.

229
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
One is seniority.

230
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.

231
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.

232
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.

233
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Teach for America: slight effect.

234
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,820
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.

235
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,820
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.

236
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
There are some people who are very good at this.

237
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
And we've done almost nothing

238
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
to study what that is

239
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
and to draw it in and to replicate it,

240
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
to raise the average capability --

241
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.

242
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"

243
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.

244
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
And it's a system with very high turnover.

245
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.

246
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.

247
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.

248
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
It's an unbelievable thing.

249
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,820
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --

250
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
and what goes on is great teaching.

251
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
They take the poorest kids,

252
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,820
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.

253
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools

254
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
is very different than in the normal public schools.

255
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,820
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.

256
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
They're taking data, the test scores,

257
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."

258
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,820
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.

259
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,

260
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
at first it's very bizarre.

261
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"

262
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.

263
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.

264
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
What's going on?"

265
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,

266
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
which kids were bored,

267
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.

268
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
It was a very dynamic environment,

269
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --

270
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
keeping people engaged and setting the tone

271
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,

272
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,820
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.

273
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Everybody needs to be involved.

274
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
And so KIPP is doing it.

275
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
How does that compare to a normal school?

276
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.

277
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
The data isn't gathered.

278
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
In the teacher's contract,

279
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,820
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --

280
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
sometimes to once per year.

281
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
And they need advanced notice to do that.

282
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,

283
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
some of them just making crap

284
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,820
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,

285
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,820
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."

287
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.

288
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
They don't have the test scores,

289
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.

290
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
For example, New York passed a law

291
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,820
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used

292
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
in the tenure decision for the teachers.

293
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.

294
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
But I'm optimistic about this,

295
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I think there are some clear things we can do.

296
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,820
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,

297
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
and that's given us the picture of where we are.

298
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,820
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,

299
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.

300
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Of course, digital video is cheap now.

301
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Putting a few cameras in the classroom

302
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,820
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis

303
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
is very practical in all public schools.

304
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down

305
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.

306
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.

307
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"

308
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.

309
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,

310
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,820
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.

311
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
You can take those great courses and make them available

312
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,820
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.

313
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
If you have a kid who's behind,

314
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,820
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.

315
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,820
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,

316
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,820
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,

317
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,820
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.

318
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,820
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,

319
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
we can do it much better.

320
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --

321
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
the place that this is going on --

322
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,820
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."

323
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
And I thought it was so fantastic.

324
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.

325
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.

326
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,820
(Applause)

327
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Now, we put a lot of money into education,

328
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,820
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right

329
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,820
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.

330
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --

331
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
and it was taken out in the Senate

333
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,820
because there are people who are threatened by these things.

334
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
But I -- I'm optimistic.

335
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,820
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,

336
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,820
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.

337
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
I only had time to frame those two problems.

338
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
There's a lot more problems like that --

339
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,820
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,

340
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
just at the very name of these things.

341
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,820
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.

342
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.

343
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,820
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.

344
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,820
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.

345
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,820
So it's going to take brilliant people like you

346
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,820
to study these things, get other people involved --

347
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,820
and you're helping to come up with solutions.

348
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,820
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.

349
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Thank you.

350
00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:09,820
(Applause)
