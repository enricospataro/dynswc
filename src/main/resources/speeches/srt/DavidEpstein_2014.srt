1
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,901
The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."

2
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,670
Faster, Higher, Stronger.

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,610
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,766
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

5
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,082
ran two hours and eight minutes.

6
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:29,702
Had he been racing against the winner

7
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:32,168
of the 1904 Olympic marathon,

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:35,501
he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.

9
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,273
Now we all have this feeling

10
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:38,863
that we're somehow just getting better

11
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:41,203
as a human race, inexorably progressing,

12
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:43,344
but it's not like we've evolved into a new species

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,810
in a century.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,418
So what's going on here?

15
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,779
I want to take a look at what's really behind

16
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:51,469
this march of athletic progress.

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,766
In 1936, Jesse Owens

18
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,103
held the world record in the 100 meters.

19
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,810
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,256
in the world championships of the 100 meters,

21
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,730
when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,138
Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.

23
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:09,017
That's a lot in sprinter land.

24
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:10,520
To give you a sense of how much it is,

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,478
I want to share with you a demonstration

26
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,490
conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,655
Now picture the stadium last year

28
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:20,284
at the world championships of the 100 meters:

29
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,383
thousands of fans waiting with baited breath

30
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,857
to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;

31
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,732
flashbulbs popping as the
nine fastest men in the world

32
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:31,295
coil themselves into their blocks.

33
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:32,426
And I want you to pretend

34
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,765
that Jesse Owens is in that race.

35
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:38,010
Now close your eyes for a
second and picture the race.

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,702
Bang! The gun goes off.

37
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,770
An American sprinter jumps out to the front.

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,720
Usain Bolt starts to catch him.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,341
Usain Bolt passes him, and as
the runners come to the finish,

40
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,018
you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.

41
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:49,695
(Beeps)

42
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:52,800
That's the entire finish of the race.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,180
You can open your eyes now.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,790
That first beep was Usain Bolt.

45
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,104
That last beep was Jesse Owens.

46
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,281
Listen to it again.

47
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,999
(Beeps)

48
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,099
When you think of it like that,

49
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,370
it's not that big a difference, is it?

50
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,227
And then consider that Usain Bolt started

51
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:10,990
by propelling himself out of blocks

52
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,329
down a specially fabricated carpet

53
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,085
designed to allow him to travel

54
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,201
as fast as humanly possible.

55
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,872
Jesse Owens, on the other hand,

56
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,463
ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,

57
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,700
and that soft surface stole far more energy

58
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,477
from his legs as he ran.

59
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:29,440
Rather than blocks, Jesse
Owens had a gardening trowel

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,267
that he had to use to dig holes
in the cinders to start from.

61
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,371
Biomechanical analysis of the speed

62
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,915
of Owens' joints shows that had been running

63
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:39,429
on the same surface as Bolt,

64
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,940
he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,259
he would have been within one stride.

66
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,001
Rather than the last beep,

67
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,941
Owens would have been the second beep.

68
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,992
Listen to it again.

69
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:52,730
(Beeps)

70
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,113
That's the difference track
surface technology has made,

71
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,392
and it's done it throughout the running world.

72
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,123
Consider a longer event.

73
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:02,086
In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister

74
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:05,263
became the first man to run
under four minutes in the mile.

75
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:08,313
Nowadays, college kids do that every year.

76
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,866
On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.

77
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,608
As of the end of last year,

78
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:14,975
1,314 men

79
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,190
had run under four minutes in the mile,

80
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,640
but like Jesse Owens,

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,382
Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders

82
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,206
that stole far more energy from his legs

83
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,569
than the synthetic tracks of today.

84
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,069
So I consulted biomechanics experts

85
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,633
to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders

86
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,891
than synthetic tracks,

87
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:34,291
and their consensus that it's
one and a half percent slower.

88
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,578
So if you apply a one and a half
percent slowdown conversion

89
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,764
to every man who ran his sub-four mile

90
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,208
on a synthetic track,

91
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,904
this is what happens.

92
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:45,233
Only 530 are left.

93
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,630
If you look at it from that perspective,

94
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,950
fewer than ten new men per [year]

95
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,433
have joined the sub-four mile club

96
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,735
since Sir Roger Bannister.

97
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,802
Now, 530 is a lot more than one,

98
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,318
and that's partly because
there are many more people

99
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:59,832
training today and they're training more intelligently.

100
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:02,060
Even college kids are professional in their training

101
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,586
compared to Sir Roger Bannister,

102
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,045
who trained for 45 minutes at a time

103
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,135
while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.

104
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:10,538
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon

105
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,249
in three in a half hours,

106
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,386
that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy

107
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,418
while he ran along the course.

108
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,041
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.

109
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,104
(Laughter)

110
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:22,792
Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy

111
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,266
about performance-enhancing drugs as well,

112
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,537
and that's made a difference
in some sports at some times,

113
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,824
but technology has made a difference in all sports,

114
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,373
from faster skis to lighter shoes.

115
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,513
Take a look at the record for
the 100-meter freestyle swim.

116
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,160
The record is always trending downward,

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,910
but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.

118
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,831
This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction

119
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:45,060
of the flip turn.

120
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,089
Rather than stopping and turning around,

121
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,933
athletes could somersault under the water

122
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,451
and get going right away in the opposite direction.

123
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:54,243
This second cliff, the introduction of gutters

124
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:55,775
on the side of the pool

125
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,332
that allows water to splash off,

126
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,619
rather than becoming turbulence

127
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,866
that impedes the swimmers as they race.

128
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,505
This final cliff,

129
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,691
the introduction of full-body

130
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:05,588
and low-friction swimsuits.

131
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,277
Throughout sports, technology has
changed the face of performance.

132
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,053
In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record

133
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,377
for the longest distance cycled in one hour

134
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:18,425
at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.

135
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,673
Now that record improved and improved

136
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:23,692
as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic

137
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,306
all the way until 1996,

138
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:29,741
when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,

139
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,970
nearly five miles farther

140
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,115
than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.

141
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,538
But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union

142
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,046
decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record

143
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:44,118
had to do so with essentially the same equipment

144
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:46,783
that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.

145
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,038
Where does the record stand today?

146
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,660
30 miles, 4,657 feet,

147
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,770
a grand total of 883 feet

148
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,546
farther than Eddy Merckx cycled

149
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,247
more than four decades ago.

150
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,628
Essentially the entire improvement in this record

151
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,680
was due to technology.

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,850
Still, technology isn't the only
thing pushing athletes forward.

153
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,301
While indeed we haven't evolved

154
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,018
into a new species in a century,

155
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,978
the gene pool within competitive sports

156
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,370
most certainly has changed.

157
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,279
In the early half of the 20th century,

158
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,964
physical education instructors and coaches

159
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,236
had the idea that the average body type

160
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:22,607
was the best for all athletic endeavors:

161
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:25,930
medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.

162
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,902
And this showed in athletes' bodies.

163
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:30,155
In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper

164
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:33,870
and average elite shot-putter
were the same exact size.

165
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,780
But as that idea started to fade away,

166
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,856
as sports scientists and coaches realized that

167
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,448
rather than the average body type,

168
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,360
you want highly specialized bodies

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,690
that fit into certain athletic niches,

170
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,995
a form of artificial selection took place,

171
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:48,618
a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,

172
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,278
and athletes' bodies became
more different from one another.

173
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,234
Today, rather than the same size
as the average elite high jumper,

174
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:56,248
the average elite shot-putter

175
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,899
is two and a half inches taller

176
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,988
and 130 pounds heavier.

177
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,907
And this happened throughout the sports world.

178
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,572
In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph

179
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,100
one data point for each of two dozen sports

180
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,385
in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.

181
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:12,870
There's some dispersal,

182
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,880
but it's kind of grouped
around that average body type.

183
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,459
Then that idea started to go away,

184
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,160
and at the same time, digital technology --

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,367
first radio, then television and the Internet --

186
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,744
gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people

187
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,923
a ticket to consume elite sports performance.

188
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:30,796
The financial incentives and fame and glory
afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,

189
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:34,989
and it tipped toward the tiny
upper echelon of performance.

190
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:38,416
It accelerated the artificial
selection for specialized bodies.

191
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,044
And if you plot a data point for these same

192
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:43,926
two dozen sports today, it looks like this.

193
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,353
The athletes' bodies have gotten

194
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:47,547
much more different from one another.

195
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,656
And because this chart looks like the charts

196
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:51,387
that show the expanding universe,

197
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,847
with the galaxies flying away from one another,

198
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,491
the scientists who discovered it call it

199
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,780
"The Big Bang of Body Types."

200
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,188
In sports where height is prized, like basketball,

201
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,978
the tall athletes got taller.

202
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:06,084
In 1983, the National Basketball Association

203
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,407
signed a groundbreaking agreement

204
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,459
making players partners in the league,

205
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,009
entitled to shares of ticket revenues

206
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,916
and television contracts.

207
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,119
Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player

208
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,315
wanted to be,

209
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,161
and teams started scouring the globe

210
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,441
for the bodies that could
help them win championships.

211
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,184
Almost overnight,

212
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,562
the proportion of men in the NBA

213
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,454
who are at least seven feet tall doubled

214
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,219
to 10 percent.

215
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,242
Today, one in 10 men in the NBA

216
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,424
is at least seven feet tall,

217
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,573
but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare

218
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,092
in the general population --

219
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,742
so rare that if you know an American man

220
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,147
between the ages of 20 and 40

221
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:41,283
who is at least seven feet tall,

222
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,055
there's a 17 percent chance

223
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,860
he's in the NBA right now.

224
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,798
(Laughter)

225
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:50,674
That is, find six honest seven footers,

226
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,904
one is in the NBA right now.

227
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,733
And that's not the only way that
NBA players' bodies are unique.

228
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,348
This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"

229
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,771
the ideal proportions,

230
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,770
with arm span equal to height.

231
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,278
My arm span is exactly equal to my height.

232
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,414
Yours is probably very nearly so.

233
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,576
But not the average NBA player.

234
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,383
The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",

235
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,694
with arms that are seven feet long.

236
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:17,492
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,

237
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,770
they are ludicrously long.

238
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,775
Had Leonardo wanted to draw

239
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,750
the Vitruvian NBA Player,

240
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,723
he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,

241
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,505
not a circle and a square.

242
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,670
So in sports where large size is prized,

243
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,741
the large athletes have gotten larger.

244
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,720
Conversely, in sports where
diminutive stature is an advantage,

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,937
the small athletes got smaller.

246
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,600
The average elite female gymnast

247
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,363
shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average

248
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,700
over the last 30 years,

249
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,815
all the better for their power-to-weight ratio

250
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,585
and for spinning in the air.

251
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:47,947
And while the large got larger

252
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:49,311
and the small got smaller,

253
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,739
the weird got weirder.

254
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,289
The average length of the forearm

255
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,040
of a water polo player in relation

256
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,897
to their total arm got longer,

257
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,026
all the better for a forceful throwing whip.

258
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,753
And as the large got larger,

259
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,123
small got smaller, and the weird weirder.

260
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,316
In swimming, the ideal body type

261
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:07,211
is a long torso and short legs.

262
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,150
It's like the long hull of a canoe

263
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,856
for speed over the water.

264
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,621
And the opposite is advantageous in running.

265
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,636
You want long legs and a short torso.

266
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,832
And this shows in athletes' bodies today.

267
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,427
Here you see Michael Phelps,

268
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:19,891
the greatest swimmer in history,

269
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,760
standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,

270
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,747
the world record holder in the mile.

271
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:27,564
These men are seven inches different in height,

272
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,766
but because of the body types

273
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,629
advantaged in their sports,

274
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,017
they wear the same length pants.

275
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,511
Seven inches difference in height,

276
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,031
these men have the same length legs.

277
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,989
Now in some cases, the search for bodies

278
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,962
that could push athletic performance forward

279
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:43,605
ended up introducing into the competitive world

280
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,744
populations of people that weren't
previously competing at all,

281
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:49,496
like Kenyan distance runners.

282
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,826
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.

283
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,204
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe

284
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,304
as being great marathoners.

285
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,399
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent

286
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,196
of the Kenyan population

287
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,365
but the vast majority of elite runners.

288
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,671
And they happen, on average,

289
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,775
to have a certain unique physiology:

290
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:07,856
legs that are very long

291
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:10,394
and very thin at their extremity,

292
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:11,812
and this is because they have their ancestry

293
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,247
at very low latitude

294
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:15,662
in a very hot and dry climate,

295
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:17,552
and an evolutionary adaptation to that

296
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,510
is limbs that are very long

297
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,029
and very thin at the extremity

298
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,803
for cooling purposes.

299
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,832
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,

300
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,674
to increase surface area compared to volume

301
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,616
to let heat out,

302
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,129
and because the leg is like a pendulum,

303
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,786
the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,

304
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,565
the more energy-efficient it is to swing.

305
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:37,159
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,

306
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,886
consider that 17 American men in history

307
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,515
have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes

308
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,804
in the marathon.

309
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,851
That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.

310
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,786
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.

311
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:51,880
(Laughter)

312
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,701
That's from a source population the size

313
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:56,528
of metropolitan Atlanta.

314
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,102
Still, even changing technology

315
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,708
and the changing gene pool in sports

316
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,181
don't account for all of the changes in performance.

317
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,071
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.

318
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,440
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets

319
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,712
an electrical shock

320
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,035
and they're thrown across a room?

321
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,606
There's no explosion there.

322
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,844
What's happening when that happens is that

323
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,306
the electrical impulse is causing

324
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,436
all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,

325
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,030
and they're throwing themselves across the room.

326
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,927
They're essentially jumping.

327
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:22,104
That's the power

328
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,053
that's contained in the human body.

329
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,280
But normally we can't access nearly all of it.

330
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,299
Our brain acts as a limiter,

331
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,594
preventing us from accessing
all of our physical resources,

332
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:31,835
because we might hurt ourselves,

333
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,527
tearing tendons or ligaments.

334
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:36,550
But the more we learn about
how that limiter functions,

335
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,430
the more we learn how we can push it back

336
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,870
just a bit,

337
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,302
in some cases by convincing the brain

338
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,076
that the body won't be in mortal danger

339
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,886
by pushing harder.

340
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,505
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports

341
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,077
serve as a great example.

342
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:51,199
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful

343
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,614
to human health,

344
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,032
but now we realize

345
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,128
that we have all these traits

346
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:58,232
that are perfect for ultra-endurance:

347
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:01,156
no body fur and a glut of sweat glands

348
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,772
that keep us cool while running;

349
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:06,172
narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;

350
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:09,090
large surface area of joints for shock absorption.

351
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,824
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,

352
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,927
short toes that are better for pushing off

353
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,601
than for grasping tree limbs,

354
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,728
and when we run,

355
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,253
we can turn our torso and our shoulders

356
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,297
like this while keeping our heads straight.

357
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,780
Our primate cousins can't do that.

358
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,090
They have to run like this.

359
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,156
And we have big old butt muscles

360
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:28,243
that keep us upright while running.

361
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:29,961
Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?

362
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,966
They have no buns because they don't run upright.

363
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,353
And as athletes have realized

364
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,910
that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,

365
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,957
they've taken on feats

366
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,366
that would have been unthinkable before,

367
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:44,269
athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.

368
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,269
Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.

369
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,781
(Laughter)

370
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:50,390
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.

371
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,112
It's so steep he can't even run here.

372
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,765
He's pulling up on a rope.

373
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,102
This is a vertical ascent

374
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,211
of more than 8,000 feet,

375
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,878
and Kílian went up and down

376
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,259
in under three hours.

377
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,178
Amazing.

378
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,367
And talented though he is,

379
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,191
Kílian is not a physiological freak.

380
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,870
Now that he has done this,

381
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,781
other athletes will follow,

382
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,298
just as other athletes followed

383
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:13,872
after Sir Roger Bannister

384
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,010
ran under four minutes in the mile.

385
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,637
Changing technology, changing genes,

386
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:20,035
and a changing mindset.

387
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,819
Innovation in sports,

388
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,476
whether that's new track surfaces

389
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,940
or new swimming techniques,

390
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,810
the democratization of sport,

391
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,151
the spread to new bodies

392
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,736
and to new populations around the world,

393
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,789
and imagination in sport,

394
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,225
an understanding of what the human body

395
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:36,006
is truly capable of,

396
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,898
have conspired to make athletes stronger,

397
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,421
faster, bolder,

398
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,398
and better than ever.

399
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,754
Thank you very much.

400
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:48,280
(Applause)
