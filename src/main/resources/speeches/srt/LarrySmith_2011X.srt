1
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:17,946
I want to discuss with you this afternoon

2
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,408
why you're going to fail
to have a great career.

3
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,807
(Laughter)

4
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,025
I'm an economist.

5
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:25,909
I do dismal.

6
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:30,214
End of the day, it's ready
for dismal remarks.

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:34,664
I only want to talk to those of you
who want a great career.

8
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:38,727
I know some of you have already decided
you want a good career.

9
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,141
You're going to fail, too.

10
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,236
(Laughter)

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,869
Because -- goodness,
you're all cheery about failing.

12
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:44,902
(Laughter)

13
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:46,728
Canadian group, undoubtedly.

14
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,878
(Laughter)

15
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:52,720
Those trying to have good careers
are going to fail,

16
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:55,664
because, really, good jobs
are now disappearing.

17
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:59,454
There are great jobs and great careers,

18
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:02,110
and then there are the high-workload,

19
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:06,610
high-stress, bloodsucking,
soul-destroying kinds of jobs,

20
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,335
and practically nothing in-between.

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,760
So people looking for good jobs
are going to fail.

22
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,966
I want to talk about those
looking for great jobs, great careers,

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,846
and why you're going to fail.

24
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:23,719
First reason is that no matter
how many times people tell you,

25
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,973
"If you want a great career,
you have to pursue your passion,

26
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:30,242
you have to pursue your dreams,
you have to pursue

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:33,234
the greatest fascination in your life,"

28
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:36,513
you hear it again and again,
and then you decide not to do it.

29
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,861
It doesn't matter
how many times you download

30
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:44,060
Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,

31
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,896
you still look at it
and decide not to do it.

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,610
I'm not quite sure
why you decide not to do it.

33
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,711
You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.

34
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:54,602
You're afraid if you look
for your passion and don't find it,

35
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:57,356
you'll feel like you're an idiot,
so then you make excuses

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,102
about why you're not going
to look for your passion.

37
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,022
They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.

38
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,221
We're going to go through
a whole long list --

39
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:08,511
your creativity in thinking of excuses
not to do what you really need to do

40
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,757
if you want to have a great career.

41
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:16,405
So, for example,
one of your great excuses is:

42
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,786
(Sigh)

43
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,565
"Well, great careers are
really and truly, for most people,

44
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,716
just a matter of luck.

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,812
So I'm going to stand around,
I'm going to try to be lucky,

46
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:29,082
and if I'm lucky,
I'll have a great career.

47
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,716
If not, I'll have a good career."

48
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,343
But a good career is an impossibility,
so that's not going to work.

49
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,018
Then, your other excuse is,

50
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:40,604
"Yes, there are special people
who pursue their passions,

51
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,962
but they are geniuses.

52
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,540
They are Steven J.

53
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,167
I'm not a genius.

54
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,798
When I was five, I thought I was a genius,

55
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:51,742
but my professors have beaten that idea
out of my head long since."

56
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,121
(Laughter)

57
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:57,637
"And now I know
I am completely competent."

58
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,343
Now, you see, if this was 1950,

59
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,383
being completely competent --

60
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:05,449
that would have given you a great career.

61
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:06,626
But guess what?

62
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,371
This is almost 2012,
and saying to the world,

63
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:13,710
"I am totally, completely competent,"

64
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,815
is damning yourself
with the faintest of praise.

65
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:20,212
And then, of course, another excuse:

66
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,792
"Well, I would do this,
I would do this, but, but --

67
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:27,323
well, after all, I'm not weird.

68
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:30,473
Everybody knows that people
who pursue their passions

69
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:31,900
are somewhat obsessive.

70
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:33,393
A little strange.

71
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,052
Hmm? Hmm? Okay?

72
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:38,298
You know, a fine line
between madness and genius.

73
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:42,607
"I'm not weird. I've read
Steven J.'s biography.

74
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:46,490
Oh my goodness --
I'm not that person. I am nice.

75
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,848
I am normal.

76
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:51,670
I'm a nice, normal person,
and nice, normal people --

77
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,370
don't have passion."

78
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:55,418
(Laughter)

79
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,943
"Ah, but I still want a great career.

80
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,896
I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,451
so I know what I'm going to do,

82
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,339
because I have a solution.

83
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,815
I have a strategy.

84
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,253
It's the one Mommy
and Daddy told me about.

85
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:10,332
Mommy and Daddy told me
that if I worked hard,

86
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:12,110
I'd have a good career.

87
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:15,435
So, if you work hard
and have a good career,

88
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,467
if you work really, really, really hard,

89
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,812
you'll have a great career.

90
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:21,252
Doesn't that, like,
mathematically make sense?"

91
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,760
Hmm. Not.

92
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:25,249
But you've managed
to talk yourself into that.

93
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,349
You know what? Here's a little secret:

94
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:30,443
You want to work? You want to work
really, really, really hard?

95
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:31,920
You know what? You'll succeed.

96
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,850
The world will give you the opportunity

97
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,489
to work really, really,
really, really hard.

98
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:40,453
But, are you so sure

99
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:43,397
that that's going to give you
a great career,

100
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,239
when all the evidence is to the contrary?

101
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:51,766
So let's deal with those of you
who are trying to find your passion.

102
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,463
You actually understand
that you really had better do it,

103
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:55,813
never mind the excuses.

104
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,825
You're trying to find your passion --

105
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,479
(Sigh)

106
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:00,883
and you're so happy.

107
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,921
You found something you're interested in.

108
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:05,986
"I have an interest! I have an interest!"

109
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,168
You tell me.

110
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:10,215
You say, "I have an interest!"
I say, "That's wonderful!

111
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,486
And what are you trying to tell me?"

112
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,025
"Well, I have an interest."

113
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,609
I say, "Do you have passion?"

114
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,252
"I have an interest," you say.

115
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,564
"Your interest is compared to what?"

116
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,490
"Well, I'm interested in this."

117
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,797
"And what about the rest
of humanity's activities?"

118
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,616
"I'm not interested in them."

119
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,743
"You've looked at them all, have you?"

120
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,870
"No. Not exactly."

121
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:34,552
Passion is your greatest love.

122
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:37,401
Passion is the thing

123
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:42,445
that will help you create
the highest expression of your talent.

124
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,040
Passion, interest --
it's not the same thing.

125
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,595
Are you really going to go
to your sweetie and say,

126
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,478
"Marry me! You're interesting."

127
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:53,612
(Laughter)

128
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,572
Won't happen.

129
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,690
Won't happen, and you will die alone.

130
00:05:57,714 --> 00:05:59,056
(Laughter)

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,365
What you want,

132
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:02,897
what you want, what you want,

133
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,309
is passion.

134
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,143
It is beyond interest.

135
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,793
You need 20 interests,
and then one of them,

136
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,563
one of them might grab you,

137
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:14,167
one of them might engage you
more than anything else,

138
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,785
and then you may have found
your greatest love,

139
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,000
in comparison to all the other things
that interest you,

140
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,741
and that's what passion is.

141
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,796
I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.

142
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,659
He was an economically rational person.

143
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,729
He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.

144
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,421
Let us merge our interests."

145
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,317
(Laughter)

146
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:38,492
Yes, he did.

147
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,810
"I love you truly," he said.
"I love you deeply.

148
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:47,110
I love you more than any other woman
I've ever encountered.

149
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:51,687
I love you more than Mary,
Jane, Susie, Penelope,

150
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,727
Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --

151
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,203
I was on a German exchange program then.

152
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:59,266
I love you more than --"

153
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,839
All right.

154
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,244
She left the room

155
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:06,836
halfway through his enumeration
of his love for her.

156
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,772
After he got over his surprise
at being, you know, turned down,

157
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:15,541
he concluded he'd had a narrow escape

158
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,856
from marrying an irrational person.

159
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:22,721
Although, he did make a note to himself
that the next time he proposed,

160
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,404
it was perhaps not necessary

161
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:29,587
to enumerate all of the women
he had auditioned for the part.

162
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,702
(Laughter)

163
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,166
But the point stands.

164
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,831
You must look for alternatives
so that you find your destiny,

165
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,490
or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?

166
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:42,350
Does the word "destiny" scare you?

167
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,936
That's what we're talking about.

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,905
And if you don't find
the highest expression of your talent,

169
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,103
if you settle for "interesting,"
what the hell ever that means,

170
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:53,286
do you know what will happen
at the end of your long life?

171
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,524
Your friends and family will be
gathered in the cemetery,

172
00:07:56,548 --> 00:08:00,040
and there beside your gravesite
will be a tombstone,

173
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,666
and inscribed on that tombstone

174
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,541
it will say, "Here lies
a distinguished engineer,

175
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,365
who invented Velcro."

176
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:14,294
But what that tombstone should have said,

177
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,992
in an alternative lifetime,

178
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:21,468
what it should have said if it was
your highest expression of talent,

179
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:26,044
was, "Here lies the last
Nobel Laureate in Physics,

180
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:29,409
who formulated
the Grand Unified Field Theory

181
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:32,836
and demonstrated
the practicality of warp drive."

182
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:35,601
(Laughter)

183
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,372
Velcro, indeed!

184
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,881
(Laughter)

185
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,339
One was a great career.

186
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,866
One was a missed opportunity.

187
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:49,862
But then, there are some of you who,

188
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:53,242
in spite of all these
excuses, you will find,

189
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,281
you will find your passion.

190
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,829
And you'll still fail.

191
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,863
You're going to fail, because --

192
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:06,439
because you're not going to do it,

193
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:10,447
because you will have
invented a new excuse,

194
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,248
any excuse to fail to take action,

195
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:18,366
and this excuse, I've heard so many times:

196
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:25,292
"Yes, I would pursue a great career,

197
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:32,053
but, I value human relationships --

198
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,078
(Laughter)

199
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:34,610
more than accomplishment.

200
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,572
I want to be a great friend.

201
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,840
I want to be a great spouse.

202
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,713
I want to be a great parent,

203
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,856
and I will not sacrifice them

204
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,870
on the altar of great accomplishment."

205
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,523
(Laughter)

206
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,047
What do you want me to say?

207
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:53,833
Now, do you really want
me to say now, tell you,

208
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,356
"Really, I swear I don't kick children."

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,333
(Laughter)

210
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,809
Look at the worldview
you've given yourself.

211
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,894
You're a hero no matter what.

212
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,042
And I, by suggesting ever so delicately

213
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,240
that you might want a great career,
must hate children.

214
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:13,273
I don't hate children. I don't kick them.

215
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:16,192
Yes, there was a little kid
wandering through this building

216
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,640
when I came here, and no,
I didn't kick him.

217
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:20,107
(Laughter)

218
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,243
Course, I had to tell him
the building was for adults only,

219
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,869
and to get out.

220
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,789
He mumbled something about his mother,

221
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:30,337
and I told him she'd probably
find him outside anyway.

222
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,045
Last time I saw him,
he was on the stairs crying.

223
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,157
(Laughter)

224
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:35,338
What a wimp.

225
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:36,369
(Laughter)

226
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,985
But what do you mean?
That's what you expect me to say.

227
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,986
Do you really think it's appropriate

228
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:47,623
that you should actually take
children and use them as a shield?

229
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,861
You know what will happen someday,

230
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,884
you ideal parent, you?

231
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:56,908
The kid will come to you someday and say,

232
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:59,344
"I know what I want to be.

233
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,383
I know what I'm going to do with my life."

234
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:02,582
You are so happy.

235
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:04,828
It's the conversation
a parent wants to hear,

236
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:06,709
because your kid's good in math,

237
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,526
and you know you're going to like
what comes next.

238
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,008
Says your kid,

239
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:14,435
"I have decided I want to be a magician.

240
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,580
I want to perform
magic tricks on the stage."

241
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,579
(Laughter)

242
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,167
And what do you say?

243
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:25,451
You say, you say,

244
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:28,798
"That's risky, kid.

245
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,621
Might fail, kid. Don't make
a lot of money at that, kid.

246
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,613
I don't know, kid, you should
think about that again, kid.

247
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:36,612
You're so good at math, why don't you --"

248
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:38,170
The kid interrupts you and says,

249
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,542
"But it is my dream.
It is my dream to do this."

250
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,131
And what are you going to say?

251
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,797
You know what you're going to say?

252
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,327
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --

253
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,589
But --"

254
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:54,513
So how are you going to finish
the sentence with your "but"?

255
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:59,818
"But. I had a dream too, once,
kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."

256
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:03,180
Or are you going to tell him this:

257
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:04,856
"I had a dream once, kid.

258
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,523
But then, you were born."

259
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,857
(Laughter)

260
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,523
(Applause)

261
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:18,594
Do you really want to use your family,

262
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:23,165
do you really ever want to look
at your spouse and your kid,

263
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,738
and see your jailers?

264
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:30,032
There was something
you could have said to your kid,

265
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,746
when he or she said, "I have a dream."

266
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,768
You could have said --

267
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:39,813
looked the kid in the face and said,

268
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,619
"Go for it, kid!

269
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,686
Just like I did."

270
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,971
But you won't be able to say that,

271
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,653
because you didn't.

272
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,252
So you can't.

273
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:54,241
(Laughter)

274
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,073
And so the sins of the parents

275
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,224
are visited on the poor children.

276
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:09,620
Why will you seek refuge
in human relationships

277
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:15,573
as your excuse not to find
and pursue your passion?

278
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,635
You know why.

279
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,699
In your heart of hearts, you know why,

280
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,945
and I'm being deadly serious.

281
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,657
You know why you would get
all warm and fuzzy

282
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,576
and wrap yourself
up in human relationships.

283
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:31,347
It is because you are --

284
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,122
you know what you are.

285
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,522
You're afraid to pursue your passion.

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,032
You're afraid to look ridiculous.

287
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:41,564
You're afraid to try.

288
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,395
You're afraid you may fail.

289
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:53,038
Great friend, great spouse,
great parent, great career.

290
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:57,052
Is that not a package?
Is that not who you are?

291
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,942
How can you be one without the other?

292
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:02,851
But you're afraid.

293
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:08,840
And that's why you're not
going to have a great career.

294
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,588
Unless --

295
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:18,799
"unless," that most evocative
of all English words --

296
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,286
"unless."

297
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:25,624
But the "unless" word is also attached

298
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:30,600
to that other, most terrifying phrase,

299
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,513
"If only I had ..."

300
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:35,987
"If only I had ..."

301
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:41,257
If you ever have that thought
ricocheting in your brain,

302
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,638
it will hurt a lot.

303
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,455
So, those are the many reasons

304
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,455
why you are going to fail

305
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,121
to have a great career.

306
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,410
Unless --

307
00:14:58,518 --> 00:14:59,677
Unless.

308
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:02,884
Thank you.

309
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,845
(Applause)
