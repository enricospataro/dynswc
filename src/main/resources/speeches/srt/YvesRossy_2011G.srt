Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns

11
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,201
by just putting his head
on one or the other side.

12
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:43,796
And sometimes he assists that
with his hands,

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,237
sometimes even with the leg.

14
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:50,360

65
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:05,835
When you go out of an airplane,
you are almost naked.

66
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,458
You take a position like that.

67

a tracking position,

68
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,796
you have the feeling that you are flying.

69
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,490
And that's the nearest thing to the dream.

70
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,002
You have no machine around you.

71
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,796

It is purely your body,

87
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,498
and the wings become part
of the body and vice versa?

88
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:06,950
YR: That's really the goal,

89
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,710
because if you put in steering,

90
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,375
then you reinvent the airplane.

91
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,986

freedom of movement.

playing the airplane.

96
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,395

So, new things.

103
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,796
So you have to adapt.

104
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,375
I'm quite an experienced
manager of systems as a pilot,

105
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,796
but this is, really --

106
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,184
You need fluidity,

107
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,676
you need to be agile

108
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,176
and also to adapt really fast.

it's not such a big problem with oxygen.

114
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,349
But for example, bikers,

115
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,344
they have the same speed.

116

132
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,938

where you lost control

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,605
and then you dived down into the clouds

144
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,796
and in the ocean.

145
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,617
So that was one of those cases
where you let the wings go, right?

146
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,066
YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,

147
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,796
but you lose orientation completely.

148
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,376
So I did try to take, again,

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,328
a climb altitude.

150
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,400
I thought, okay, I will go out.

151
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:09,215
But most probably,
I did something like that.

152
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,309
(Laughter)

153
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,796
BG: Something that is not
very safe, the image.

(Laughter)

156
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,111
But you have not the right altitude.

157
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,328
So the next thing I saw was just blue.

158
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,796
It was the sea.

159
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,806
I have also an audible altimeter.

160
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,132
So I was at my minimum altitude

161
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:33,464
in that vector -- fast --

162
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,341
so I pulled that.

163
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:36,763
And then I did open my chute.

164
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,359
BG: So the wings have their own parachute,
and you have your two parachutes.

165
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,994
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue
parachute for the wing

166
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,796
for two reasons:

167
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,535
so I can repair it afterward

168
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,905
and especially so nobody takes
that, just on his head.

169
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,160
BG: I see. Maybe come back here.

170
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,613
This is risky stuff indeed.

171
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,562
People have died trying
to do this kind of thing.

172
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:02,682
And you don't look like a crazy guy;
you're a Swiss airline pilot,

173
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,472
so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.

174
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,266
I assume you have standards.

YR: No, that's really two worlds.

180
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:20,602
Civil aviation is something
that we know very well.

181
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:23,522
We have a hundred years of experience.

182
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:27,780
And you can adapt really precisely.

183
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:30,796
With that, I have to adapt
to something new.

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,383
That means improvise.

185
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,050
So it's really a play
between these two approaches.

186
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:39,289
Something that I know
very well, these principles.

187
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:42,574
For example, we have
two engines on an Airbus;

188
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:44,953
with only one engine, you can fly it.

189
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:47,564
So plan B, always a plan B.

190
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:49,494
In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.

191
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,545
That's my ejection seat.

192
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,545
So I have the approach
of a professional pilot

193
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:59,814
with the respect of a pioneer

194
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,542
in front of Mother Nature.

195
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,796
BG: It's well said.

196
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,952
What happens if one of the engines stops?

197
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:11,593
YR: I do a roll.

198
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:14,901
And then I stabilize,

199
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:18,897
and according to my altitude,
I continue on two or three engines.

200
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,478
It's sometimes possible.

201
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:23,679
It's quite complicated to explain,

202
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:27,073
but according to which regime I was,

203
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:28,796
I can continue on two

204
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,439
and try to get a nice place to land,
and then I open my parachute.

205
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:34,084
BG: So the beginning of the flight

206
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,480
is actually you jump
off a plane or a helicopter,

207
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,223
and you go on a dive
and accelerate the engines,

208
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,796
and then you basically take off
mid-air somewhere.

209
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,796
And then the landing, as we have seen,

210
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,662
arriving on this side of the Channel,

211
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,381
is through a parachute.

212
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:50,270
So just as a curiosity,

213
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:53,151
where did you land when you flew
over the Grand Canyon?

214
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:55,796
Did you land on the rim,
down at the bottom?

215
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,090
YR: It was down on the bottom.

216
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:02,466
And I came back afterward
on the sled of the helicopter back.

217
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,899
But it was too stony
and full of cactus on top.

218
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:07,939
(Laughter)

219
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,105
BG: That's exactly
why I asked the question.

220
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,954
YR: And also, the currents
are quite funny there.

221
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:16,184
There is big thermal activity,

222
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,240
big difference in altitude also.

223
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,173
So it was much safer for me
to land at the bottom.

224
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,514
BG: I think that right now,
many people are asking,

225
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,506
"When are you developing a double-seater

226
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,796
so they can fly with you?"

227
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,002
YR: I have a standard answer.

228
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:34,502
Have you ever seen tandem birds?

229
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,027
(Laughter)

230
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,192
BG: Perfect answer.

231
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,266
(Applause)

232
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:46,796
(Applause ends)

233
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,517
BG: Yves, one last question.

234
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,796
What's next for you?
What's next for Jetman?

235
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,131
YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.

236
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,174
I want to share it,
to do formation flights.

237
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,238
And I plan to start from a cliff,

238
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:04,143
like catapulted from a cliff.

239
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,168
BG: So instead of jumping
off a plane, yes?

240
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:10,096
YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,
but with initial speed.

241
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,432
Really, I go step by step.

242
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,540
It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.

243
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:19,119
It's possible to start already now,
it's just too dangerous.

244
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,103
(Laughter)

245
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:26,515
Thanks to the increasing technology,
better technology,

246
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,822
it will be safe.

247
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,796
And I hope it will be for everybody.

248
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,633
BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.

249
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,717
(Applause)
