1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,352
I'm Michael Shermer,
director of the Skeptics Society,

2
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:15,908
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,845
We investigate claims of the paranormal,

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,551
pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,
and claims of all kinds between,

5
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,469
science and pseudo-science
and non-science and junk science,

6
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,796
voodoo science, pathological science,
bad science, non-science,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,707
and plain old non-sense.

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,648
And unless you've been on Mars recently,

9
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,690
you know there's a lot of that out there.

10
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:36,736
Some people call us debunkers,
which is kind of a negative term.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,868
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.

12
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:42,345
We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there --

13
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:45,796
well, we're sort of like
the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,050
(Laughter)

15
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:49,796
trying to replace bad ideas
with good ideas.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,683
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.

17
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:52,865
I brought this with me,

18
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:56,796
this was given to us
by NBC Dateline to test.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,106
It's produced by the Quadro
Corporation of West Virginia.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,040
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.

21
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,510
(Laughter)

22
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:09,796
This was being sold to high-school
administrators for $900 apiece.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,147
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio
Shack antenna attached to it.

24
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,137
You could dowse for all sorts of things,

25
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,554
but this particular one was built
to dowse for marijuana

26
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:20,796
in students' lockers.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,280
(Laughter)

28
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:26,849
So the way it works
is you go down the hallway,

29
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,872
and you see if it tilts
toward a particular locker,

30
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:31,340
and then you open the locker.

31
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:32,941
So it looks something like this.

32
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,148
I'll show you.

33
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,796
(Laughter)

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,211
Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.

35
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:43,040
Well, this is science,
so we'll do a controlled experiment.

36
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:44,646
It'll go this way for sure.

37
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,604
(Laughter)

38
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,154
Sir, do you want to empty
your pockets, please, sir?

39
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,016
(Laughter)

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,497
So the question was, can it actually
find marijuana in students' lockers?

41
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,119
And the answer is,
if you open enough of them, yes.

42
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:00,166
(Laughter)

43
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,796
(Applause)

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,201
But in science, we have to keep track
of the misses, not just the hits.

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,491
And that's probably the key lesson
to my short talk here:

46
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:12,249
This is how psychics work, astrologers,
tarot card readers and so on.

47
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:14,492
People remember the hits
and forget the misses.

48
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,411
In science, we keep the whole database,

49
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:19,096
and look to see if the number
of hits somehow stands out

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,333
from the total number
you'd expect by chance.

51
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,651
In this case, we tested it.

52
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,167
We had two opaque boxes:

53
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:27,825
one with government-approved THC
marijuana, and one with nothing.

54
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,730
And it got it 50 percent of the time --

55
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:30,847
(Laughter)

56
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,796
which is exactly what you'd expect
with a coin-flip model.

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,811
So that's just a fun little example
here of the sorts of things we do.

58
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:41,303
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.
Each one has a particular theme.

59
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,401
This one is on the future of intelligence.

60
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,196
Are people getting smarter or dumber?

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,268
I have an opinion of this myself
because of the business I'm in,

62
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,959
but in fact, people, it turns out,
are getting smarter.

63
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:53,796
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.

64
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,471
Sort of an interesting thing.

65
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:59,042
With science, don't think of skepticism
as a thing, or science as a thing.

66
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,796
Are science and religion compatible?

67
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,051
It's like, are science
and plumbing compatible?

68
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:04,709
They're just two different things.

69
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,472
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.

70
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,218
It's a way of thinking about things.

71
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,312
It's a way of looking for natural
explanations for all phenomena.

72
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:12,686
I mean, what's more likely:

73
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,273
that extraterrestrial intelligences
or multi-dimensional beings

74
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,687
travel across vast distances
of interstellar space

75
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,891
to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's
field in Puckerbrush, Kansas

76
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,725
to promote skeptic.com, our web page?

77
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:28,227
Or is it more likely that a reader
of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?

78
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,901
And in all cases we have to ask --

79
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,749
(Laughter)

80
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,796
What's the more likely explanation?

81
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,987
Before we say something
is out of this world,

82
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,675
we should first make sure
that it's not in this world.

83
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,850
What's more likely:

84
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:43,200
that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
in his run for the governorship,

85
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,722
or that the "World Weekly News"
makes stuff up?

86
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,135
(Laughter)

87
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,821
The same theme is expressed nicely
here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.

88
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:55,060
For those of you in the back,
it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.

89
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,796
I think you need to be more
explicit here in step two."

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,316
This single slide completely dismantles
the intelligent design arguments.

91
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,188
There's nothing more to it than that.

92
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,262
(Applause)

93
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,674
You can say a miracle occurs,

94
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,664
it's just that it doesn't explain
anything or offer anything.

95
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:10,838
There's nothing to test.

96
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,310
It's the end of the conversation
for intelligent design creationists.

97
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:19,220
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw
terms out as linguistic place fillers --

98
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:21,592
dark energy or dark matter,
something like that --

99
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:24,076
until we figure out what it is,
we'll call it this.

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,801
It's the beginning of the causal
chain for science.

101
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,900
For intelligent design creationists,
it's the end of the chain.

102
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,096
So again, we can ask this:
what's more likely?

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,511
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual
cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?

104
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:40,796
This is a UFO shot from my house
in Altadena, California,

105
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,796
looking down over Pasadena.

106
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,341
And if it looks a lot like a Buick
hubcap, it's because it is.

107
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:49,103
You don't even need Photoshop
or high-tech equipment,

108
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:50,325
you don't need computers.

109
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,796
This was shot with a throwaway
Kodak Instamatic camera.

110
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,916
You just have somebody off on the side
with a hubcap ready to go.

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,838
Camera's ready -- that's it.

112
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,299
(Laughter)

113
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:03,796
So, although it's possible
that most of these things are fake

114
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,534
or illusions or so on,
and that some of them are real,

115
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,691
it's more likely that all of them
are fake, like the crop circles.

116
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:14,096
On a more serious note, in all of science
we're looking for a balance

117
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,796
between data and theory.

118
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,796
In the case of Galileo,
he had two problems

119
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,181
when he turned his telescope to Saturn.

120
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:25,327
First of all, there was no
theory of planetary rings.

121
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,544
Second of all, his data
was grainy and fuzzy,

122
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:30,096
and he couldn't quite make out
what he was looking at.

123
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,796
So he wrote that he had seen --

124
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,327
"I have observed that the furthest
planet has three bodies."

125
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,216
And this is what he ended up
concluding that he saw.

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,796
So without a theory of planetary
rings and with only grainy data,

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,738
you can't have a good theory.

128
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,381
It wasn't solved until 1655.

129
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:48,419
This is Christiaan Huygens's book
that catalogs all the mistakes

130
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,405
people made trying to figure out
what was going on with Saturn.

131
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,285
It wasn't till Huygens had two things:

132
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:57,795
He had a good theory of planetary rings
and how the solar system operated,

133
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,682
and he had better telescopic,
more fine-grain data

134
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:04,249
in which he could figure out that
as the Earth is going around faster --

135
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:07,501
according to Kepler's Laws --
than Saturn, then we catch up with it.

136
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:10,796
And we see the angles of the rings
at different angles, there.

137
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,040
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.

138
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:18,361
The problem with having a theory is that
it may be loaded with cognitive biases.

139
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:21,652
So one of the problems of explaining
why people believe weird things

140
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:23,744
is that we have things, on a simple level,

141
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,596
and then I'll go to more serious ones.

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,496
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.

143
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,296
This is the face on Mars.

144
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,832
In 1976, where there was a whole movement
to get NASA to photograph that area

145
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:37,772
because people thought this was monumental
architecture made by Martians.

146
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,567
Here's the close-up of it from 2001.

147
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,051
If you squint, you can still see the face.

148
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,377
And when you're squinting,

149
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,424
you're turning that from fine-grain
to coarse-grain,

150
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,735
so you're reducing
the quality of your data.

151
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,988
And if I didn't tell you what to look for,
you'd still see the face,

152
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,441
because we're programmed
by evolution to see faces.

153
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,616
Faces are important for us socially.

154
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,108
And of course, happy faces,
faces of all kinds are easy to see.

155
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,028
You see the happy face on Mars, there.

156
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:04,203
(Laughter)

157
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:07,140
If astronomers were frogs,
perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.

158
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,117
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.

159
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:11,703
Or if geologists were elephants?

160
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:15,796
Religious iconography.

161
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,621
(Laughter)

162
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,796
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.

163
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,297
He charged five bucks a head
to come see the nun bun

164
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:27,034
till he got a cease-and-desist
from Mother Teresa's lawyer.

165
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:30,796
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,

166
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,424
or is it up the street from here?

167
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:35,796
Tree bark is particularly good
because it's nice and grainy, branchy,

168
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
black-and-white splotchy and you can
get the pattern-seeking --

169
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:40,796
humans are pattern-seeking animals.

170
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,383
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side
of a glass window in Sao Paulo.

171
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:47,821
Here's when the Virgin Mary made
her appearance on a cheese sandwich --

172
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:50,335
which I got to actually
hold in a Las Vegas casino --

173
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,896
of course, this being America.

174
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,445
(Laughter)

175
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,796
This casino paid $28,500
on eBay for the cheese sandwich.

176
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,796
(Laughter)

177
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,201
But who does it really look like?
The Virgin Mary?

178
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,204
(Laughter)

179
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:08,093
It has that sort of
puckered lips, 1940s-era look.

180
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,796
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.

181
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,796
I actually went to see this one.

182
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,654
There was a lot of people there.

183
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:18,330
The faithful come in their wheelchairs
and crutches, and so on.

184
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:20,215
We went down and investigated.

185
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,412
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins,
me and The Amazing Randi,

186
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,849
next to this two,
two and a half story-sized image.

187
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,375
All these candles, thousands of candles
people had lit in tribute to this.

188
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,204
So we walked around the backside,
to see what was going on.

189
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,559
It turns out wherever there's
a sprinkler head and a palm tree,

190
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,796
you get the effect.

191
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,201
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside,
which they started to wipe off.

192
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,796
I guess you can only have
one miracle per building.

193
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,153
(Laughter)

194
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,856
So is it really a miracle of Mary,
or is it a miracle of Marge?

195
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,881
(Laughter)

196
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,508
And now I'm going to finish up
with another example of this,

197
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,309
with auditory illusions.

198
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,859
There's this film, "White Noise,"
with Michael Keaton,

199
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:02,417
about the dead talking back to us.

200
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,106
By the way, the whole business of talking
to the dead is not that big a deal.

201
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,615
Anybody can do it, turns out.

202
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,727
It's getting the dead to talk
back that's the really hard part.

203
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:11,849
(Laughter)

204
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:15,655
In this case, supposedly, these messages
are hidden in electronic phenomena.

205
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,964
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page
where I downloaded this stuff.

206
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:22,139
This is the most famous one
of all of these.

207
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:24,964
Here's the forward version
of the very famous song.

208
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,059
(Music with lyrics)

209
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:31,241
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now.

210
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,704
It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen.

211
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:42,571
Yes, there are two paths you
can go by, but in the long run,

212
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,254
There's still time to change
the road you're on

213
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:53,164
Couldn't you just listen to that all day?

214
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,795
All right, here it is backwards,

215
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:58,849
and see if you can hear the hidden
messages that are supposedly in there.

216
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:06,111
(Music with unintelligible lyrics)

217
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,564
(Lyrics) Satan!

218
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:21,065
(Unintelligible lyrics continue)

219
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,374
What did you get?
Audience: Satan!

220
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:32,110
Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan".

221
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:34,436
Now, I'll prime the auditory
part of your brain

222
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,897
to tell you what you're supposed
to hear, and then hear it again.

223
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:41,722
(Music with lyrics)

224
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:05,579
(Music ends)

225
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:06,810
(Laughter)

226
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:13,223
(Applause)

227
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:15,796
You can't miss it
when I tell you what's there.

228
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,070
(Laughter)

229
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:23,129
I'm going to just end
with a positive, nice little story.

230
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,998
The Skeptics is a nonprofit
educational organization.

231
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,842
We're always looking for little
good things that people do.

232
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,875
And in England, there's a pop singer.

233
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,644
One of the top popular singers
in England today, Katie Melua.

234
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,196
And she wrote a beautiful song.

235
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,796
It was in the top five in 2005, called,
"Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."

236
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,916
It's a love story -- she's sort
of the Norah Jones of the UK --

237
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,561
about how she much loves her guy,

238
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:49,061
and compared to nine million
bicycles, and so forth.

239
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,310
And she has this one passage here.

240
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:52,370
(Music)

241
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:58,165
(Lyrics) We are 12 billion
light-years from the edge

242
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,514
That's a guess,

243
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:04,249
No one can ever say it's true,

244
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:08,876
But I know that I will always be with you.

245
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,516
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
At least she got it close.

246
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,463
In America it'd be,
"We're 6,000 light years from the edge."

247
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,523
(Laughter)

248
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,316
But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle
physicist now turned science educator,

249
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,467
who wrote the book
"The Big Bang," and so on,

250
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,896
uses every chance he gets
to promote good science.

251
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,206
And so he wrote an op-ed piece
in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,

252
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,266
in which he said, well, we know exactly
how far from the edge.

253
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,108
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years,
and it's not a guess.

254
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:41,396
We know within precise
error bars how close it is.

255
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,230
So we can say, although not absolutely
true, it's pretty close to being true.

256
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:49,993
And, to his credit, Katie called him up
after this op-ed piece came out, and said,

257
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,388
"I'm so embarrassed.
I was in the astronomy club.

258
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:53,690
I should've known better."

259
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:54,936
And she re-cut the song.

260
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,808
So I will end with the new version.

261
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:58,096
(Music with lyrics)

262
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,541
We are 13.7 billion light years

263
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:04,056
from the edge of the observable universe.

264
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,849
That's a good estimate
with well-defined error bars.

265
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:11,025
And with the available information,

266
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,392
I predict that I will always be with you.

267
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,573
(Laughter)

268
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:17,765
How cool is that?

269
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:19,820
(Applause)
