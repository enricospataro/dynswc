1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,796
So, I'll start with this:

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,011
a couple years ago,
an event planner called me

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,083
because I was going
to do a speaking event.

4
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,796
And she called, and she said,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,796
"I'm really struggling with how
to write about you on the little flyer."

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,868
And I thought,
"Well, what's the struggle?"

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,796
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,796
and I'm going to call you
a researcher, I think,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,707
but I'm afraid if I call you
a researcher, no one will come,

10
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,197
because they'll think
you're boring and irrelevant."

11
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:37,221
(Laughter)

12
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,796
And I was like, "Okay."

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,297
And she said, "But the thing
I liked about your talk

14
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,796
is you're a storyteller.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,796
So I think what I'll do
is just call you a storyteller."

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,796
And of course, the academic,
insecure part of me

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,610
was like, "You're going
to call me a what?"

18
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:54,196
And she said, "I'm going
to call you a storyteller."

19
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:57,253
And I was like, "Why not magic pixie?"

20
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,796
(Laughter)

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,796
I was like, "Let me think
about this for a second."

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,796
I tried to call deep on my courage.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,796
And I thought, you know,
I am a storyteller.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,796
I'm a qualitative researcher.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,796
I collect stories; that's what I do.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,796
And maybe stories
are just data with a soul.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,796
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,796
And so I said, "You know what?

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,796
Why don't you just say
I'm a researcher-storyteller."

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,796
And she went, "Ha ha.
There's no such thing."

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,796
(Laughter)

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,796
So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
and I'm going to talk to you today --

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,868
we're talking about expanding
perception --

34
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:36,273
and so I want to talk to you
and tell some stories

35
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:41,796
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,796
and really actually changed
the way that I live and love

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,796
and work and parent.

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,796
And this is where my story starts.

39
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,796
When I was a young researcher,
doctoral student,

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,796
my first year I had a research
professor who said to us,

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,796
"Here's the thing, if you cannot
measure it, it does not exist."

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,796
And I thought he was just
sweet-talking me.

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,796
I was like, "Really?"
and he was like, "Absolutely."

44
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,534
And so you have to understand

45
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,796
that I have a bachelor's in social work,
a master's in social work,

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,296
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
so my entire academic career

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,796
was surrounded by people who kind of
believed in the "life's messy, love it."

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,796
And I'm more of the, "life's messy,
clean it up, organize it

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,796
and put it into a bento box."

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,796
(Laughter)

51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,796
And so to think that I had found my way,
to found a career that takes me --

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,796
really, one of the big sayings
in social work

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,796
is, "Lean into the discomfort
of the work."

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,796
And I'm like, knock discomfort
upside the head

55
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,796
and move it over and get all A's.

56
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,796
That was my mantra.

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,796
So I was very excited about this.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,796
And so I thought, you know what,
this is the career for me,

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,796
because I am interested
in some messy topics.

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,963
But I want to be able
to make them not messy.

61
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,196
I want to understand them.

62
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,796
I want to hack into these things
I know are important

63
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,796
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

64
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,796
So where I started was with connection.

65
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,796
Because, by the time
you're a social worker for 10 years,

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,796
what you realize is that connection
is why we're here.

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,796
It's what gives purpose
and meaning to our lives.

68
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,896
This is what it's all about.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,016
It doesn't matter whether
you talk to people

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,131
who work in social justice,
mental health and abuse and neglect,

71
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:34,796
what we know is that connection,
the ability to feel connected, is --

72
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,796
neurobiologically
that's how we're wired --

73
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,796
it's why we're here.

74
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,833
So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.

75
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,796
Well, you know that situation

76
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,868
where you get an evaluation
from your boss,

77
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,796
and she tells you 37 things
you do really awesome,

78
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,963
and one "opportunity for growth?"

79
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:54,796
(Laughter)

80
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,073
And all you can think about
is that opportunity for growth, right?

81
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,796
Well, apparently this is the way
my work went as well,

82
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,796
because, when you ask people about love,
they tell you about heartbreak.

83
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,796
When you ask people about belonging,

84
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,796
they'll tell you their most excruciating
experiences of being excluded.

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,796
And when you ask people about connection,

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,796
the stories they told me
were about disconnection.

87
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:22,520
So very quickly -- really about six weeks
into this research --

88
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:27,796
I ran into this unnamed thing
that absolutely unraveled connection

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,560
in a way that I didn't understand
or had never seen.

90
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,601
And so I pulled back out of the research

91
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,895
and thought, I need
to figure out what this is.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,099
And it turned out to be shame.

93
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,996
And shame is really easily understood
as the fear of disconnection:

94
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:47,686
Is there something about me that,
if other people know it or see it,

95
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:50,796
that I won't be worthy of connection?

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,796
The things I can tell you about it:

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,796
it's universal; we all have it.

98
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
The only people who don't experience shame

99
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:59,178
have no capacity for human
empathy or connection.

100
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:00,796
No one wants to talk about it,

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,470
and the less you talk about it
the more you have it.

102
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:09,796
What underpinned this shame,
this "I'm not good enough," --

103
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,796
which we all know that feeling:

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,868
"I'm not blank enough.
I'm not thin enough,

105
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:17,796
rich enough, beautiful enough,
smart enough, promoted enough."

106
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,796
The thing that underpinned this
was excruciating vulnerability,

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,796
this idea of, in order
for connection to happen,

108
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,796
we have to allow ourselves
to be seen, really seen.

109
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,963
And you know how I feel
about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.

110
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:39,796
And so I thought, this is my chance
to beat it back with my measuring stick.

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,796
I'm going in, I'm going
to figure this stuff out,

112
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,963
I'm going to spend a year, I'm going
to totally deconstruct shame,

113
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:48,273
I'm going to understand
how vulnerability works,

114
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,796
and I'm going to outsmart it.

115
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

116
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,763
As you know,
it's not going to turn out well.

117
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:01,299
(Laughter)

118
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,796
You know this.

119
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,796
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

120
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,916
but I'd have to borrow
everyone else's time.

121
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,796
But here's what I can tell you
that it boils down to --

122
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,201
and this may be one of the most important
things that I've ever learned

123
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,089
in the decade of doing this research.

124
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:19,796
My one year turned into six years:

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,796
thousands of stories, hundreds
of long interviews, focus groups.

126
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,201
At one point, people were
sending me journal pages

127
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,296
and sending me their stories --

128
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:32,796
thousands of pieces of data in six years.

129
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,796
And I kind of got a handle on it.

130
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,567
I kind of understood, this is
what shame is, this is how it works.

131
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:45,796
I wrote a book, I published a theory,
but something was not okay --

132
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,820
and what it was is that, if I roughly
took the people I interviewed

133
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:56,701
and divided them into people who really
have a sense of worthiness --

134
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:59,796
that's what this comes down to,
a sense of worthiness --

135
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,796
they have a strong sense
of love and belonging --

136
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,796
and folks who struggle for it,

137
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,740
and folks who are always wondering
if they're good enough.

138
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,026
There was only one variable that separated

139
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,796
the people who have a strong sense
of love and belonging

140
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
and the people who really struggle for it.

141
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:18,796
And that was, the people who have
a strong sense of love and belonging

142
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,796
believe they're worthy
of love and belonging.

143
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,796
That's it.

144
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
They believe they're worthy.

145
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,796
And to me, the hard part of the one thing
that keeps us out of connection

146
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,796
is our fear that we're not
worthy of connection,

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,201
was something that,
personally and professionally,

148
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,796
I felt like I needed to understand better.

149
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,796
So what I did is I took
all of the interviews

150
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,796
where I saw worthiness,
where I saw people living that way,

151
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,796
and just looked at those.

152
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,796
What do these people have in common?

153
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,796
I have a slight office supply addiction,
but that's another talk.

154
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,796
So I had a manila folder,
and I had a Sharpie,

155
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,470
and I was like, what am I going
to call this research?

156
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,796
And the first words that came
to my mind were whole-hearted.

157
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,344
These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.

158
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,796
So I wrote at the top
of the manila folder,

159
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,796
and I started looking at the data.

160
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,796
In fact, I did it first in a four-day
very intensive data analysis,

161
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,396
where I went back, pulled the interviews,
the stories, pulled the incidents.

162
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,796
What's the theme? What's the pattern?

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,796
My husband left town with the kids

164
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,796
because I always go into this
Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

165
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,796
where I'm just writing
and in my researcher mode.

166
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
And so here's what I found.

167
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,796
What they had in common
was a sense of courage.

168
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,896
And I want to separate courage
and bravery for you for a minute.

169
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,016
Courage, the original
definition of courage,

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
when it first came
into the English language --

171
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,085
it's from the Latin word cor, meaning
heart --

172
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,100
and the original definition was to tell
the story of who you are

173
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,535
with your whole heart.

174
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:08,772
And so these folks had, very simply,
the courage to be imperfect.

175
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,796
They had the compassion to be kind
to themselves first and then to others,

176
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,391
because, as it turns out,

177
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,649
we can't practice compassion
with other people

178
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:20,416
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.

179
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,796
And the last was they had connection,
and -- this was the hard part --

180
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,796
as a result of authenticity,

181
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,796
they were willing to let go
of who they thought they should be

182
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,796
in order to be who they were,
which you have to absolutely do that

183
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
for connection.

184
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,820
The other thing that they had
in common was this:

185
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
They fully embraced vulnerability.

186
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:58,883
They believed that what made them
vulnerable made them beautiful.

187
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,796
They didn't talk about vulnerability
being comfortable,

188
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,796
nor did they really talk
about it being excruciating --

189
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,297
as I had heard it earlier
in the shame interviewing.

190
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:14,321
They just talked about it being necessary.

191
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,805
They talked about the willingness
to say, "I love you" first,

192
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:27,796
the willingness to do something
where there are no guarantees,

193
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,154
the willingness to breathe
through waiting for the doctor to call

194
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,733
after your mammogram.

195
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:38,376
They're willing to invest
in a relationship

196
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,796
that may or may not work out.

197
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,690
They thought this was fundamental.

198
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,796
I personally thought it was betrayal.

199
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,796
I could not believe I had pledged
allegiance to research, where our job --

200
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,947
you know, the definition of research
is to control and predict,

201
00:10:55,972 --> 00:11:00,796
to study phenomena, for the explicit
reason to control and predict.

202
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,796
And now my mission to control and predict

203
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,011
had turned up the answer
that the way to live is with vulnerability

204
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,796
and to stop controlling and predicting.

205
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,796
This led to a little breakdown --

206
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,796
(Laughter)

207
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,796
-- which actually looked more like this.

208
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,796
(Laughter)

209
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,796
And it did.

210
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,999
I call it a breakdown; my therapist
calls it a spiritual awakening.

211
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,232
(Laughter)

212
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,696
A spiritual awakening
sounds better than breakdown,

213
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,496
but I assure you it was a breakdown.

214
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,092
And I had to put my data away
and go find a therapist.

215
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,396
Let me tell you something:
you know who you are

216
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,659
when you call your friends and say,
"I think I need to see somebody.

217
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:43,796
Do you have any recommendations?"

218
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,868
Because about five
of my friends were like,

219
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:48,035
"Wooo, I wouldn't want
to be your therapist."

220
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,796
(Laughter)

221
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,796
I was like, "What does that mean?"

222
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,796
And they're like,
"I'm just saying, you know.

223
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,796
Don't bring your measuring stick."

224
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,069
(Laughter)

225
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,053
I was like, "Okay."

226
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,796
So I found a therapist.

227
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,264
My first meeting with her, Diana --

228
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:12,796
I brought in my list of the way
the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.

229
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,796
And she said, "How are you?"

230
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,796
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."

231
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,796
She said, "What's going on?"

232
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,796
And this is a therapist
who sees therapists,

233
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,796
because we have to go to those,
because their B.S. meters are good.

234
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,796
(Laughter)

235
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,796
And so I said, "Here's the thing,
I'm struggling."

236
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,796
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

237
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,796
And I said, "Well, I have
a vulnerability issue.

238
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,796
And I know that vulnerability
is the core of shame and fear

239
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,796
and our struggle for worthiness,

240
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,796
but it appears that it's also
the birthplace of joy, of creativity,

241
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,796
of belonging, of love.

242
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,796
And I think I have a problem,
and I need some help."

243
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,796
And I said, "But here's the thing:
no family stuff, no childhood shit."

244
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,796
(Laughter)

245
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,796
"I just need some strategies."

246
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,796
(Laughter)

247
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,519
(Applause)

248
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,582
Thank you.

249
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,297
So she goes like this.

250
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,796
(Laughter)

251
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,796
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"

252
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,796
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."

253
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,796
(Laughter)

254
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,796
"It just is what it is."

255
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,796
And I said, "Oh my God,
this is going to suck."

256
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,796
(Laughter)

257
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,796
And it did, and it didn't.

258
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,796
And it took about a year.

259
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,796
And you know how there are people

260
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,249
that, when they realize that vulnerability
and tenderness are important,

261
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:54,796
that they surrender and walk into it.

262
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,096
A: that's not me,

263
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,796
and B: I don't even hang out
with people like that.

264
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,796
(Laughter)

265
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,796
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.

266
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,796
It was a slugfest.

267
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,796
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.

268
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,796
I lost the fight,

269
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,796
but probably won my life back.

270
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,796
And so then I went back into the research

271
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,796
and spent the next couple of years

272
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,796
really trying to understand
what they, the whole-hearted,

273
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,796
what choices they were making,
and what are we doing with vulnerability.

274
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,796
Why do we struggle with it so much?

275
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,345
Am I alone in struggling
with vulnerability?

276
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,796
No.

277
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
So this is what I learned.

278
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,796
We numb vulnerability --

279
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,796
when we're waiting for the call.

280
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,770
It was funny, I sent something out
on Twitter and on Facebook

281
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,059
that says, "How would you
define vulnerability?

282
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,696
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

283
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,196
And within an hour and a half,
I had 150 responses.

284
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

285
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,796
Having to ask my husband for help
because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

286
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,796
initiating sex with my husband;

287
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,796
initiating sex with my wife;

288
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,796
being turned down; asking someone out;

289
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,796
waiting for the doctor to call back;

290
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,943
getting laid off; laying off people.

291
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:16,594
This is the world we live in.

292
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:19,796
We live in a vulnerable world.

293
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,796
And one of the ways we deal
with it is we numb vulnerability.

294
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,796
And I think there's evidence --

295
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,201
and it's not the only reason
this evidence exists,

296
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,527
but I think it's a huge cause --

297
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:35,017
We are the most in-debt,

298
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,328
obese,

299
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:41,820
addicted and medicated
adult cohort in U.S. history.

300
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,796
The problem is -- and I learned this
from the research --

301
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,350
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.

302
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,796
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.

303
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,196
Here's vulnerability,
here's grief, here's shame,

304
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,896
here's fear, here's disappointment.

305
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,796
I don't want to feel these.

306
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,796
I'm going to have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

307
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,357
(Laughter)

308
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:08,213
I don't want to feel these.

309
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,096
And I know that's knowing laughter.

310
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,796
I hack into your lives for a living.

311
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,796
God.

312
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,796
(Laughter)

313
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,796
You can't numb those hard feelings

314
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,106
without numbing
the other affects, our emotions.

315
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,796
You cannot selectively numb.

316
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,796
So when we numb those,

317
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,796
we numb joy,

318
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,796
we numb gratitude,

319
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,796
we numb happiness.

320
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,788
And then we are miserable,

321
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,833
and we are looking
for purpose and meaning,

322
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,296
and then we feel vulnerable,

323
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,096
so then we have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

324
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,486
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.

325
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:50,796
One of the things that I think
we need to think about

326
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,796
is why and how we numb.

327
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,267
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.

328
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,820
The other thing we do is we make
everything that's uncertain certain.

329
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,796
Religion has gone from a belief
in faith and mystery to certainty.

330
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,796
I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.

331
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,796
That's it.

332
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,274
Just certain.

333
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,149
The more afraid we are,
the more vulnerable we are,

334
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:18,396
the more afraid we are.

335
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,296
This is what politics looks like today.

336
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,796
There's no discourse anymore.

337
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,796
There's no conversation.

338
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,796
There's just blame.

339
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,137
You know how blame
is described in the research?

340
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:32,106
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.

341
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,996
We perfect.

342
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:38,697
If there's anyone who wants their life
to look like this, it would be me,

343
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,096
but it doesn't work.

344
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,896
Because what we do is we take fat
from our butts and put it in our cheeks.

345
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,796
(Laughter)

346
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,796
Which just, I hope in 100 years,
people will look back and go, "Wow."

347
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,796
(Laughter)

348
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,796
And we perfect,
most dangerously, our children.

349
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,963
Let me tell you what we think
about children.

350
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:01,796
They're hardwired for struggle
when they get here.

351
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,796
And when you hold those perfect
little babies in your hand,

352
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,613
our job is not to say,
"Look at her, she's perfect.

353
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,596
My job is just to keep her perfect --

354
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:13,035
make sure she makes the tennis team
by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."

355
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,296
That's not our job.

356
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,796
Our job is to look and say,

357
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,868
"You know what? You're imperfect,
and you're wired for struggle,

358
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,892
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

359
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,402
That's our job.

360
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,703
Show me a generation
of kids raised like that,

361
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:28,481
and we'll end the problems
I think that we see today.

362
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:34,796
We pretend that what we do
doesn't have an effect on people.

363
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,796
We do that in our personal lives.

364
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,796
We do that corporate --

365
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,796
whether it's a bailout,
an oil spill, a recall --

366
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,796
we pretend like what we're doing

367
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,796
doesn't have a huge impact
on other people.

368
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,094
I would say to companies,
this is not our first rodeo, people.

369
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,288
We just need you to be authentic
and real and say,

370
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,820
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."

371
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,392
But there's another way,
and I'll leave you with this.

372
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,796
This is what I have found:

373
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,796
to let ourselves be seen,
deeply seen, vulnerably seen;

374
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,634
to love with our whole hearts,
even though there's no guarantee --

375
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,365
and that's really hard,

376
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,533
and I can tell you as a parent,
that's excruciatingly difficult --

377
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:28,796
to practice gratitude and joy
in those moments of terror,

378
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,106
when we're wondering,
"Can I love you this much?

379
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,106
Can I believe in this this passionately?

380
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,796
Can I be this fierce about this?"

381
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,396
just to be able to stop and, instead of
catastrophizing what might happen,

382
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,396
to say, "I'm just so grateful,

383
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,820
because to feel this vulnerable
means I'm alive."

384
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,796
And the last, which I think
is probably the most important,

385
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,796
is to believe that we're enough.

386
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,820
Because when we work from a place,
I believe, that says, "I'm enough,"

387
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:00,216
then we stop screaming
and start listening,

388
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,154
we're kinder and gentler
to the people around us,

389
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,280
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.

390
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:07,996
That's all I have. Thank you.

391
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,820
(Applause)
