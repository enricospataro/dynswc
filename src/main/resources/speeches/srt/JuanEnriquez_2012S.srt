1
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,238
All right. So, like all good stories,

2
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,172
this starts a long, long time ago

3
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,321
when there was basically nothing.

4
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,721
So here is a complete picture of the universe

5
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,173
about 14-odd billion years ago.

6
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:27,257
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.

7
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,841
For some reason it explodes,

8
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,957
and you begin to get these things.

9
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:33,823
So you're now about 14 billion years into this.

10
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,719
And these things expand and expand and expand

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,418
into these giant galaxies,

12
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:38,737
and you get trillions of them.

13
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:40,885
And within these galaxies

14
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:43,004
you get these enormous dust clouds.

15
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,769
And I want you to pay particular attention

16
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,219
to the three little prongs

17
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,120
in the center of this picture.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,535
If you take a close-up of those,

19
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,188
they look like this.

20
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:54,038
And what you're looking at is columns of dust

21
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:56,085
where there's so much dust --

22
00:00:56,085 --> 00:01:00,418
by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles --

23
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:03,336
and what's happening is there's so much dust,

24
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,270
it comes together and it fuses

25
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,729
and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,571
And so what you're watching

27
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,556
is the birth of stars.

28
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,213
These are stars being born out of here.

29
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,681
When enough stars come out,

30
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,479
they create a galaxy.

31
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,913
This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,

32
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,129
because you are here.

33
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,296
(Laughter)

34
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,947
And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,

35
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:28,012
you find a relatively normal,

36
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,380
not particularly interesting star.

37
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,395
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.

38
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,577
So this star doesn't even appear

39
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:39,528
until about two-thirds of the way into this story.

40
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:40,606
And then what happens

41
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,012
is there's enough dust left over

42
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,978
that it doesn't ignite into a star,

43
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,978
it becomes a planet.

44
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:50,803
And this is about a little over four billion years ago.

45
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,236
And soon thereafter

46
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,153
there's enough material left over

47
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:58,716
that you get a primordial soup,

48
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,480
and that creates life.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,361
And life starts to expand and expand and expand,

50
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,112
until it goes kaput.

51
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:09,600
(Laughter)

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,030
Now the really strange thing

53
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,936
is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,

54
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:16,152
but five times.

55
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,254
So almost all life on Earth

56
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,718
is wiped out about five times.

57
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,270
And as you're thinking about that,

58
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,702
what happens is you get more and more complexity,

59
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:25,936
more and more stuff

60
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:30,054
to build new things with.

61
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,324
And we don't appear

62
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:36,972
until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,

63
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:40,902
just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.

64
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:44,361
So within that context, there's two theories of the case

65
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,050
as to why we're all here.

66
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,639
The first theory of the case

67
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,048
is that's all she wrote.

68
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,407
Under that theory,

69
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,243
we are the be-all and end-all

70
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,976
of all creation.

71
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,860
And the reason for trillions of galaxies,

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,873
sextillions of planets,

73
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:05,583
is to create something that looks like that

74
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,216
and something that looks like that.

75
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,757
And that's the purpose of the universe;

76
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,041
and then it flat-lines,

77
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,352
it doesn't get any better.

78
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:17,832
(Laughter)

79
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,651
The only question you might want to ask yourself is,

80
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,886
could that be just mildly arrogant?

81
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,627
And if it is --

82
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:33,009
and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.

83
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,376
There were only about 2,000 of our species left.

84
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,459
A few more weeks without rain,

85
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,543
we would have never seen any of these.

86
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:48,242
(Laughter)

87
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:52,876
(Applause)

88
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:55,842
So maybe you have to think about a second theory

89
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,759
if the first one isn't good enough.

90
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,543
Second theory is: Could we upgrade?

91
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,442
(Laughter)

92
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:06,676
Well, why would one ask a question like that?

93
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:09,141
Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far

94
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,177
of humanoids.

95
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:14,027
So it turns out that we have upgraded.

96
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,942
We've upgraded time and again and again.

97
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,858
And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.

98
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,042
We found this one last year.

99
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,659
We found another one last month.

100
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,858
And as you're thinking about this,

101
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,961
you might also ask the question:

102
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:31,058
So why a single human species?

103
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:32,892
Wouldn't it be really odd

104
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:36,676
if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica

105
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,295
and found exactly the same bird --

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,087
particularly given that we co-existed at the same time

107
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,873
with at least eight other versions of humanoid

108
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:48,341
at the same time on this planet?

109
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,220
So the normal state of affairs

110
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,730
is not to have just a Homo sapiens;

111
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,751
the normal state of affairs

112
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,580
is to have various versions of humans walking around.

113
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,397
And if that is the normal state of affairs,

114
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,765
then you might ask yourself,

115
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,830
all right, so if we want to create something else,

116
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,698
how big does a mutation have to be?

117
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,330
Well Svante Paabo has the answer.

118
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,130
The difference between humans and Neanderthal

119
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,429
is 0.004 percent of gene code.

120
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,129
That's how big the difference is

121
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,346
one species to another.

122
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:24,746
This explains most contemporary political debates.

123
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,681
(Laughter)

124
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:29,892
But as you're thinking about this,

125
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,250
one of the interesting things

126
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,647
is how small these mutations are and where they take place.

127
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:35,980
Difference human/Neanderthal

128
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,713
is sperm and testis,

129
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,081
smell and skin.

130
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,567
And those are the specific genes

131
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,247
that differ from one to the other.

132
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,348
So very small changes can have a big impact.

133
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,980
And as you're thinking about this,

134
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,496
we're continuing to mutate.

135
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,397
So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,

136
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:55,457
we had one mutation in one gene

137
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,013
which led to blue eyes.

138
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:01,897
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing.

139
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,331
And as it continues,

140
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,096
one of the things that's going to happen this year

141
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:08,429
is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,

142
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:11,698
because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.

143
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,286
And when we find these,

144
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,780
we may find differences.

145
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,856
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,

146
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:22,232
because we have really misused the science in this.

147
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:25,915
In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.

148
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:29,713
That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.

149
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:31,849
He was Darwin's cousin.

150
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,164
But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,

151
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:36,746
Stanford, American Neurological Association

152
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,614
took this really far.

153
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:42,213
That got exported and was really misused.

154
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:44,898
In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous

155
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,911
treatment of human beings.

156
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,505
So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,

157
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:50,825
we're all identical.

158
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:54,102
We're going to know at year end if that is true.

159
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,834
And as we think about that,

160
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,352
we're actually beginning to find things

161
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:00,818
like, do you have an ACE gene?

162
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,796
Why would that matter?

163
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:06,834
Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen

164
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,584
that doesn't have an ACE gene.

165
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,453
And if you want to get more specific,

166
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:14,468
how about a 577R genotype?

167
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:19,168
Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested

168
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:22,418
carries at least one of these variants.

169
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,072
If that is true,

170
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:26,230
it leads to some very complicated questions

171
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,031
for the London Olympics.

172
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,550
Three options:

173
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,382
Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase

174
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:35,082
for really hardworking mutants?

175
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,815
(Laughter)

176
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:39,550
Option number two:

177
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,948
Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?

178
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:45,422
Because you have one and you don't have one,

179
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:49,417
I'll give you a tenth of a second head start.

180
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,488
Version number three:

181
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,557
Because this is a naturally occurring gene

182
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,339
and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,

183
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,288
you get the right to upgrade.

184
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,039
Three different options.

185
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,661
If these differences are the difference

186
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:06,039
between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.

187
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,873
And it turns out that as we discover these things,

188
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:12,208
we human beings really like to change

189
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,902
how we look, how we act,

190
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:15,496
what our bodies do.

191
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:19,870
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,

192
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,187
except that with the technologies that are coming online today,

193
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,888
today's corrections, deletions,

194
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,807
augmentations and enhancements

195
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,720
are going to seem like child's play.

196
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,421
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,

197
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,988
but this ability to start filling

198
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:40,921
things like inkjet cartridges with cells

199
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:45,595
are allowing us to print skin, organs

200
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:48,345
and a whole series of other body parts.

201
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,229
And as these technologies go forward,

202
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,013
you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --

203
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,787
2000, human genome sequence --

204
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,569
and it seems like nothing's happening,

205
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,681
until it does.

206
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:07,205
And we may just be in some of these weeks.

207
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,804
And as you're thinking about

208
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:12,255
these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000

209
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,808
and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,

210
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,972
then you don't hear a lot,

211
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:22,956
until you hear about an experiment last year in China,

212
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:26,973
where they take skin cells from this mouse,

213
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,706
put four chemicals on it,

214
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:32,272
turn those skin cells into stem cells,

215
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,737
let the stem cells grow

216
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:36,824
and create a full copy of that mouse.

217
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:40,071
That's a big deal.

218
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:41,087
Because in essence

219
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,235
what it means is you can take a cell,

220
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,521
which is a pluripotent stem cell,

221
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:48,205
which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,

222
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:52,022
and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,

223
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,804
four, eight, 16,

224
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,472
and then it gets so crowded

225
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,272
after 16 divisions

226
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,774
that those cells have to differentiate.

227
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,207
So they go down one side of the mountain,

228
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,440
they go down another.

229
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,974
And as they pick that,

230
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,224
these become bone,

231
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:09,156
and then they pick another road and these become platelets,

232
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,273
and these become macrophages,

233
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,540
and these become T cells.

234
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,492
But it's really hard, once you ski down,

235
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,015
to get back up.

236
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:21,427
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.

237
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,876
And what those four chemicals do

238
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,945
is they take any cell

239
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:27,877
and take it way back up the mountain

240
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,910
so it can become any body part.

241
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,638
And as you think of that,

242
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:33,618
what it means is potentially

243
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,793
you can rebuild a full copy

244
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:37,660
of any organism

245
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,246
out of any one of its cells.

246
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:42,777
That turns out to be a big deal

247
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:45,343
because now you can take, not just mouse cells,

248
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,661
but you can human skin cells

249
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:51,311
and turn them into human stem cells.

250
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,509
And then what they did in October

251
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,909
is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells

252
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,582
and began to turn them into liver cells.

253
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:02,626
So in theory,

254
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:07,810
you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.

255
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,528
Here's a second experiment:

256
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,661
If you could photocopy your body,

257
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:15,713
maybe you also want to take your mind.

258
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:17,278
And one of the things you saw at TED

259
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,528
about a year and a half ago

260
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:19,963
was this guy.

261
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,563
And he gave a wonderful technical talk.

262
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:24,162
He's a professor at MIT.

263
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,078
But in essence what he said

264
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,778
is you can take retroviruses,

265
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:30,578
which get inside brain cells of mice.

266
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:33,018
You can tag them with proteins

267
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:35,112
that light up when you light them.

268
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,828
And you can map the exact pathways

269
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:42,311
when a mouse sees, feels, touches,

270
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,494
remembers, loves.

271
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,867
And then you can take a fiber optic cable

272
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:50,686
and light up some of the same things.

273
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,518
And by the way, as you do this,

274
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:54,535
you can image it in two colors,

275
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:56,934
which means you can download this information

276
00:11:56,934 --> 00:12:01,674
as binary code directly into a computer.

277
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,147
So what's the bottom line on that?

278
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,347
Well it's not completely inconceivable

279
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:10,842
that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,

280
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,229
maybe into a new body.

281
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:18,314
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.

282
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:20,828
And this might have just one or two

283
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:24,348
small ethical, political, moral implications.

284
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:25,879
(Laughter)

285
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,870
Just a thought.

286
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,398
Here's the kind of questions

287
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,378
that are becoming interesting questions

288
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,862
for philosophers, for governing people,

289
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,228
for economists, for scientists.

290
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:41,512
Because these technologies are moving really quickly.

291
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,012
And as you think about it,

292
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,094
let me close with an example of the brain.

293
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,777
The first place where you would expect

294
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:50,828
to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,

295
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:53,093
both because of the inputs,

296
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,645
which are becoming massive,

297
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,427
and because of the plasticity of the organ,

298
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,961
is the brain.

299
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:02,279
Do we have any evidence that that is happening?

300
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,010
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.

301
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,512
Here's what it looks like in 2000.

302
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,594
Here's what it looks like in 2002,

303
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:16,212
2006, 2008.

304
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,294
Here's the increase in less than a decade.

305
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:24,711
And we still don't know why this is happening.

306
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:27,196
What we do know is, potentially,

307
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,228
the brain is reacting in

308
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:31,362
a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,

309
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,312
and creating individuals that are like this.

310
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:37,069
And this is only one of the conditions that's out there.

311
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:40,609
You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,

312
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,006
people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,

313
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,391
people who've got synesthesia,

314
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,722
people who've got schizophrenia.

315
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:48,256
You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,

316
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:49,474
and we still don't understand

317
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,707
how and why this is happening.

318
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,389
But one question you might want to ask is,

319
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,017
are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain

320
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,842
and of how we process data?

321
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,905
Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,

322
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:05,389
we're trying to take in as much data in a day

323
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,940
as people used to take in in a lifetime.

324
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,572
And as you're thinking about this,

325
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:12,914
there's four theories as to why this might be going on,

326
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:14,241
plus a whole series of others.

327
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,890
I don't have a good answer.

328
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,506
There really needs to be more research on this.

329
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:21,741
One option is the fast food fetish.

330
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:24,190
There's beginning to be some evidence

331
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,441
that obesity and diet

332
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,072
have something to do

333
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,840
with gene modifications,

334
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,190
which may or may not have an impact

335
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,707
on how the brain of an infant works.

336
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,662
A second option is the sexy geek option.

337
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:43,905
These conditions are highly rare.

338
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,943
(Laughter)

339
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:52,243
(Applause)

340
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,876
But what's beginning to happen

341
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,410
is because these geeks are all getting together,

342
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,307
because they are highly qualified for computer programming

343
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,625
and it is highly remunerated,

344
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,775
as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,

345
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,224
that they are concentrating geographically

346
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,191
and finding like-minded mates.

347
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:13,759
So this is the assortative mating hypothesis

348
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,459
of these genes reinforcing one another

349
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,576
in these structures.

350
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:21,526
The third, is this too much information?

351
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,023
We're trying to process so much stuff

352
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,375
that some people get synesthetic

353
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,975
and just have huge pipes that remember everything.

354
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,644
Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.

355
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:34,626
Other people react with various psychological conditions

356
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,258
or reactions to this information.

357
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:38,960
Or maybe it's chemicals.

358
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,725
But when you see an increase

359
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,076
of that order of magnitude in a condition,

360
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,641
either you're not measuring it right

361
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,159
or there's something going on very quickly,

362
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,191
and it may be evolution in real time.

363
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,694
Here's the bottom line.

364
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,875
What I think we are doing

365
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,591
is we're transitioning as a species.

366
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:03,075
And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.

367
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,526
I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis

368
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:06,925
that, for better or worse,

369
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:11,107
is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,

370
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:14,326
it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately

371
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:17,524
control the evolution of its own species,

372
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:21,358
of bacteria, of plants, of animals.

373
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:24,193
And I think that's such an order of magnitude change

374
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:27,296
that your grandkids or your great-grandkids

375
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:30,341
may be a species very different from you.

376
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,927
Thank you very much.

377
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:37,258
