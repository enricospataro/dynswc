1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,840
What I'd like to do today is talk
about one of my favorite subjects,

2
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,840
and that is the neuroscience of sleep.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,840
Now, there is a sound --

4
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:24,834
(Alarm clock)

5
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,838
Ah, it worked.

6
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,841
A sound that is desperately
familiar to most of us,

7
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,823
and of course it's the sound
of the alarm clock.

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,823
And what that truly ghastly,
awful sound does

9
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:40,835
is stop the single most important
behavioral experience

10
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,833
that we have, and that's sleep.

11
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:47,820
If you're an average sort of person,

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:51,830
36 percent of your life
will be spent asleep,

13
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,835
which means that if you live to 90,

14
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:59,844
then 32 years will have
been spent entirely asleep.

15
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:05,829
Now what that 32 years is telling us
is that sleep at some level is important.

16
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:08,840
And yet, for most of us,
we don't give sleep a second thought.

17
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:10,839
We throw it away.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,843
We really just don't think about sleep.

19
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:17,833
And so what I'd like to do today
is change your views,

20
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,827
change your ideas
and your thoughts about sleep.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,821
And the journey
that I want to take you on,

22
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,837
we need to start by going back in time.

23
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,834
"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."

24
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,837
Any ideas who said that?

25
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,842
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

26
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:39,843
Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.

27
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,833
"O sleep, O gentle sleep,
nature's soft nurse,

28
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:46,843
how have I frighted thee?"

29
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:49,835
Shakespeare again, from --
I won't say it --

30
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:50,837
the Scottish play.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,839
(Laughter)

32
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:54,840
From the same time:

33
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:59,825
"Sleep is the golden chain
that ties health and our bodies together."

34
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:03,822
Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,
another Elizabethan dramatist.

35
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,836
But if we jump forward 400 years,

36
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,843
the tone about sleep changes somewhat.

37
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:13,824
This is from Thomas Edison,
from the beginning of the 20th century.

38
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,842
"Sleep is a criminal waste of time
and a heritage from our cave days."

39
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:17,843
Bang.

40
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:20,836
(Laughter)

41
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:24,834
And if we also jump into the 1980s,

42
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:26,843
some of you may remember
that Margaret Thatcher

43
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,836
was reported to have said,
"Sleep is for wimps."

44
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,833
And of course the infamous --
what was his name? --

45
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,843
the infamous Gordon Gekko
from "Wall Street" said,

46
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,834
"Money never sleeps."

47
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:40,823
What do we do
in the 20th century about sleep?

48
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,832
Well, of course, we use
Thomas Edison's light bulb

49
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,828
to invade the night,
and we occupied the dark,

50
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,843
and in the process of this occupation,

51
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:51,838
we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.

52
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,826
We've treated it as an enemy.

53
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:59,843
At most now, I suppose,
we tolerate the need for sleep,

54
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,841
and at worst perhaps
many of us think of sleep

55
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:05,824
as an illness that needs
some sort of a cure.

56
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,837
And our ignorance about sleep
is really quite profound.

57
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:10,826
Why is it?

58
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,836
Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts?

59
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,843
Well, it's because you don't do anything
much while you're asleep, it seems.

60
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:20,821
You don't eat. You don't drink.

61
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,841
And you don't have sex.

62
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:23,826
Well, most of us anyway.

63
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,826
And so, therefore it's --

64
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:26,829
Sorry.

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,842
It's a complete waste of time, right?

66
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,827
Wrong.

67
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,832
Actually, sleep is an incredibly
important part of our biology,

68
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,827
and neuroscientists
are beginning to explain

69
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,834
why it's so very important.

70
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,825
So let's move to the brain.

71
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,841
Now, here we have a brain.

72
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:50,843
This is donated by a social scientist,

73
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,843
and they said they didn't
know what it was,

74
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:54,843
or indeed how to use it, so --

75
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,836
(Laughter)

76
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,841
Sorry.

77
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,823
So I borrowed it.

78
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,822
I don't think they noticed. Okay.

79
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,841
(Laughter)

80
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:08,839
The point I'm trying to make
is that when you're asleep,

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,834
this thing doesn't shut down.

82
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,827
In fact, some areas of the brain
are actually more active

83
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,841
during the sleep state
than during the wake state.

84
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,844
The other thing that's really
important about sleep

85
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,828
is that it doesn't arise from a single
structure within the brain,

86
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,839
but is to some extent a network property.

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,835
If we flip the brain on its back --

88
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:29,838
I love this little bit
of spinal cord here --

89
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,832
this bit here is the hypothalamus,

90
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,834
and right under there
is a whole raft of interesting structures,

91
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,824
not least the biological clock.

92
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,839
The biological clock tells us
when it's good to be up,

93
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,825
when it's good to be asleep,

94
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,824
and what that structure does is interact

95
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,827
with a whole raft of other areas
within the hypothalamus,

96
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,829
the lateral hypothalamus,
the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.

97
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,835
All of those combine,

98
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:54,841
and they send projections
down to the brain stem here.

99
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:57,841
The brain stem then projects forward

100
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:01,843
and bathes the cortex,
this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,

101
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,830
with neurotransmitters that keep us awake

102
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,841
and essentially provide us
with our consciousness.

103
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,837
So sleep arises from a whole raft

104
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,842
of different interactions
within the brain,

105
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:14,828
and essentially,
sleep is turned on and off

106
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,836
as a result of a range
of interactions in here.

107
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,842
Okay. So where have we got to?

108
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:22,831
We've said that sleep is complicated

109
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:27,823
and it takes 32 years of our life.

110
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,823
But what I haven't explained
is what sleep is about.

111
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,829
So why do we sleep?

112
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,837
And it won't surprise
any of you that, of course,

113
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:36,838
the scientists, we don't have a consensus.

114
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,843
There are dozens of different ideas
about why we sleep,

115
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:42,822
and I'm going to outline three of those.

116
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,843
The first is sort of the restoration idea,

117
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,830
and it's somewhat intuitive.

118
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,834
Essentially, all the stuff
we've burned up during the day,

119
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:53,824
we restore, we replace,
we rebuild during the night.

120
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,835
And indeed, as an explanation,
it goes back to Aristotle,

121
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,838
so that's, what, 2,300 years ago.

122
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,831
It's gone in and out of fashion.

123
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:01,844
It's fashionable at the moment

124
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,837
because what's been shown
is that within the brain,

125
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,821
a whole raft of genes

126
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:09,820
have been shown
to be turned on only during sleep,

127
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:13,826
and those genes are associated
with restoration and metabolic pathways.

128
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,843
So there's good evidence
for the whole restoration hypothesis.

129
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,831
What about energy conservation?

130
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,821
Again, perhaps intuitive.

131
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,844
You essentially sleep to save calories.

132
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,843
Now, when you do the sums,
though, it doesn't really pan out.

133
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:33,825
If you compare an individual
who has slept at night,

134
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,843
or stayed awake
and hasn't moved very much,

135
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:41,834
the energy saving of sleeping
is about 110 calories a night.

136
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,826
Now, that's the equivalent
of a hot dog bun.

137
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:48,831
Now, I would say that a hot dog bun

138
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,827
is kind of a meager return

139
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,828
for such a complicated
and demanding behavior as sleep.

140
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,838
So I'm less convinced
by the energy conservation idea.

141
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,835
But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,

142
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,829
which is brain processing
and memory consolidation.

143
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,843
What we know is that,
if after you've tried to learn a task,

144
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,839
and you sleep-deprive individuals,

145
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,829
the ability to learn that task is smashed.

146
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,829
It's really hugely attenuated.

147
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,834
So sleep and memory consolidation
is also very important.

148
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:20,826
However, it's not just
the laying down of memory

149
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:21,828
and recalling it.

150
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,843
What's turned out to be really exciting

151
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:28,835
is that our ability to come up
with novel solutions to complex problems

152
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,843
is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.

153
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:34,830
In fact, it's been estimated
to give us a threefold advantage.

154
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,843
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.

155
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:39,843
And what seems to be going on
is that, in the brain,

156
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,835
those neural connections
that are important,

157
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,842
those synaptic connections
that are important,

158
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,835
are linked and strengthened,

159
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:50,836
while those that are less important
tend to fade away and be less important.

160
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:52,826
Okay.

161
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:55,829
So we've had three explanations
for why we might sleep,

162
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,830
and I think the important thing to realize
is that the details will vary,

163
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,825
and it's probable we sleep
for multiple different reasons.

164
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:05,827
But sleep is not an indulgence.

165
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:10,823
It's not some sort of thing
that we can take on board rather casually.

166
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,839
I think that sleep was once
likened to an upgrade

167
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,837
from economy to business class,
you know, the equivalent of.

168
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:20,837
It's not even an upgrade
from economy to first class.

169
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:23,833
The critical thing to realize

170
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,839
is that if you don't sleep,

171
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
you don't fly.

172
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,822
Essentially, you never get there,

173
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,832
and what's extraordinary
about much of our society these days

174
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,833
is that we are desperately sleep-deprived.

175
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,838
So let's now look at sleep deprivation.

176
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,843
Huge sectors of society
are sleep-deprived,

177
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,828
and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.

178
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,823
So in the 1950s, good data
suggests that most of us

179
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,840
were getting around about eight hours
of sleep a night.

180
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,830
Nowadays, we sleep one and a half
to two hours less every night,

181
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:57,844
so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours
every-night league.

182
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,835
For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.

183
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:04,835
They need nine hours
for full brain performance,

184
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,827
and many of them, on a school night,
are only getting five hours of sleep.

185
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:09,833
It's simply not enough.

186
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,843
If we think about other sectors
of society, the aged,

187
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:17,835
if you are aged, then your ability
to sleep in a single block

188
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,823
is somewhat disrupted,
and many sleep, again,

189
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:21,839
less than five hours a night.

190
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,842
Shift work.

191
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:24,833
Shift work is extraordinary,

192
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,843
perhaps 20 percent
of the working population,

193
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:31,822
and the body clock does not shift
to the demands of working at night.

194
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,823
It's locked onto the same
light-dark cycle as the rest of us.

195
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,839
So when the poor old
shift worker is going home

196
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,826
to try and sleep during the day,
desperately tired,

197
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,829
the body clock is saying,
"Wake up. This is the time to be awake."

198
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,837
So the quality of sleep
that you get as a night shift worker

199
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:48,835
is usually very poor,
again in that sort of five-hour region.

200
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:52,829
And then, of course, tens of millions
of people suffer from jet lag.

201
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,831
So who here has jet lag?

202
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,826
Well, my goodness gracious.

203
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,825
Well, thank you very much
indeed for not falling asleep,

204
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,834
because that's what your brain is craving.

205
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:08,823
One of the things that the brain does
is indulge in micro-sleeps,

206
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:09,844
this involuntary falling asleep,

207
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,822
and you have essentially
no control over it.

208
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:15,821
Now, micro-sleeps can be sort
of somewhat embarrassing,

209
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,821
but they can also be deadly.

210
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:20,835
It's been estimated
that 31 percent of drivers

211
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:24,843
will fall asleep at the wheel
at least once in their life,

212
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:27,830
and in the U.S.,
the statistics are pretty good:

213
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:32,830
100,000 accidents on the freeway
have been associated with tiredness,

214
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,827
loss of vigilance, and falling asleep.

215
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:36,837
A hundred thousand a year.
It's extraordinary.

216
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,841
At another level of terror,

217
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:42,830
we dip into the tragic
accidents at Chernobyl

218
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:44,840
and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,

219
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,831
which was so tragically lost.

220
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,843
And in the investigations
that followed those disasters,

221
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:53,821
poor judgment as a result
of extended shift work

222
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:55,827
and loss of vigilance and tiredness

223
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:59,844
was attributed to a big chunk
of those disasters.

224
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,832
When you're tired, and you lack sleep,

225
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,843
you have poor memory,
you have poor creativity,

226
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,825
you have increased impulsiveness,

227
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:11,844
and you have overall poor judgment.

228
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,841
But my friends,
it's so much worse than that.

229
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,820
(Laughter)

230
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:18,843
If you are a tired brain,

231
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,823
the brain is craving things to wake it up.

232
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,825
So drugs, stimulants.

233
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:27,843
Caffeine represents
the stimulant of choice

234
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,833
across much of the Western world.

235
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,833
Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,

236
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,831
and if you're a really naughty
tired brain, nicotine.

237
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,842
Of course, you're fueling
the waking state with these stimulants,

238
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,826
and then of course
it gets to 11 o'clock at night,

239
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:41,837
and the brain says to itself,

240
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,843
"Actually, I need
to be asleep fairly shortly.

241
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:46,840
What do we do about that
when I'm feeling completely wired?"

242
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,827
Well, of course,
you then resort to alcohol.

243
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,821
Now alcohol, short-term,
you know, once or twice,

244
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,841
to use to mildly sedate you,
can be very useful.

245
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,838
It can actually ease the sleep transition.

246
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,843
But what you must be so aware of
is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep,

247
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,831
a biological mimic for sleep.

248
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:06,835
It sedates you.

249
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,830
So it actually harms
some of the neural processing

250
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,831
that's going on during memory
consolidation

251
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,837
and memory recall.

252
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:15,824
So it's a short-term acute measure,

253
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,843
but for goodness sake,
don't become addicted

254
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:20,832
to alcohol as a way of getting
to sleep every night.

255
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,835
Another connection
between loss of sleep is weight gain.

256
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,825
If you sleep around
about five hours or less every night,

257
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:31,843
then you have a 50 percent
likelihood of being obese.

258
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,841
What's the connection here?

259
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:36,842
Well, sleep loss seems
to give rise to the release

260
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,825
of the hormone ghrelin,
the hunger hormone.

261
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,835
Ghrelin is released.

262
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:42,825
It gets to the brain.

263
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,841
The brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"

264
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:48,831
and what it does is seek out carbohydrates
and particularly sugars.

265
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,827
So there's a link between tiredness

266
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:53,835
and the metabolic
predisposition for weight gain.

267
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,844
Stress.

268
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,828
Tired people are massively stressed.

269
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,844
And one of the things of stress,
of course, is loss of memory,

270
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,824
which is what I sort of just
then had a little lapse of.

271
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,839
But stress is so much more.

272
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,822
So if you're acutely stressed,
not a great problem,

273
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:12,840
but it's sustained stress

274
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,821
associated with sleep loss
that's the problem.

275
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:19,824
So sustained stress leads
to suppressed immunity,

276
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,840
and so tired people tend to have
higher rates of overall infection,

277
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,834
and there's some very good studies

278
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:28,828
showing that shift workers, for example,
have higher rates of cancer.

279
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,835
Increased levels of stress
throw glucose into the circulation.

280
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:35,835
Glucose becomes a dominant part
of the vasculature

281
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:38,826
and essentially you become
glucose intolerant.

282
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,824
Therefore, diabetes 2.

283
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:46,831
Stress increases cardiovascular disease
as a result of raising blood pressure.

284
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,841
So there's a whole raft of things
associated with sleep loss

285
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:53,829
that are more than just
a mildly impaired brain,

286
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,834
which is where I think most people think
that sleep loss resides.

287
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,821
So at this point in the talk,
this is a nice time to think,

288
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:03,823
"Well, do you think on the whole
I'm getting enough sleep?"

289
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:04,843
So a quick show of hands.

290
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,836
Who feels that they're getting
enough sleep here?

291
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:10,834
Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.

292
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:13,837
Good. We'll talk more about that later,
about what are your tips.

293
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:15,843
So most of us, of course,
ask the question,

294
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,827
"How do I know whether
I'm getting enough sleep?"

295
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:19,840
Well, it's not rocket science.

296
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,842
If you need an alarm clock to get
you out of bed in the morning,

297
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,842
if you are taking a long time to get up,

298
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,836
if you need lots of stimulants,

299
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,832
if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,

300
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,832
if you're told by your work colleagues
that you're looking tired and irritable,

301
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,838
chances are you are sleep-deprived.

302
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,838
Listen to them. Listen to yourself.

303
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:37,840
What do you do?

304
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,827
Well -- and this is slightly offensive --

305
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:41,832
sleep for dummies.

306
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,838
(Laughter)

307
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,831
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.

308
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:50,820
The first critical thing is make it
as dark as you possibly can,

309
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,841
and also make it slightly cool.

310
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:52,844
Very important.

311
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:55,843
Actually, reduce
your amount of light exposure

312
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:58,828
at least half an hour
before you go to bed.

313
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:01,823
Light increases levels
of alertness and will delay sleep.

314
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,821
What's the last thing that most of us
do before we go to bed?

315
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:05,843
We stand in a massively lit bathroom

316
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:08,833
looking into the mirror
cleaning our teeth.

317
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,840
It's the worst thing we can possibly do
before we went to sleep.

318
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,840
Turn off those mobile phones.
Turn off those computers.

319
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:18,829
Turn off all of those things
that are also going to excite the brain.

320
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:21,843
Try not to drink caffeine
too late in the day,

321
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:24,826
ideally not after lunch.

322
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:28,823
Now, we've set about reducing light
exposure before you go to bed,

323
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:29,843
but light exposure in the morning

324
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:33,828
is very good at setting the biological
clock to the light-dark cycle.

325
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:34,836
So seek out morning light.

326
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:36,841
Basically, listen to yourself.

327
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:38,830
Wind down.

328
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,839
Do those sorts of things that you know
are going to ease you off

329
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,836
into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.

330
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:46,823
Okay.

331
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:48,836
That's some facts. What about some myths?

332
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,820
Teenagers are lazy.

333
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:51,841
No. Poor things.

334
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:55,827
They have a biological predisposition
to go to bed late and get up late,

335
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:56,836
so give them a break.

336
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,825
We need eight hours of sleep a night.

337
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,834
That's an average.

338
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,822
Some people need more.
Some people need less.

339
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,830
And what you need to do
is listen to your body.

340
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,833
Do you need that much or do you need more?

341
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,841
Simple as that.

342
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:12,820
Old people need less sleep.

343
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:13,825
Not true.

344
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:16,825
The sleep demands
of the aged do not go down.

345
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,841
Essentially, sleep fragments
and becomes less robust,

346
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,844
but sleep requirements do not go down.

347
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:26,833
And the fourth myth is,
early to bed, early to rise

348
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,826
makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

349
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,824
Well that's wrong
at so many different levels.

350
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,829
(Laughter)

351
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,821
There is no evidence that getting up early
and going to bed early

352
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:40,835
gives you more wealth at all.

353
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:43,821
There's no difference
in socioeconomic status.

354
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,840
In my experience, the only difference
between morning people and evening people

355
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:49,829
is that those people
that get up in the morning early

356
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,841
are just horribly smug.

357
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,843
(Laughter)

358
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,834
(Applause)

359
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:56,835
Okay.

360
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,823
So for the last part,
the last few minutes,

361
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:00,838
what I want to do is change gears

362
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,820
and talk about some really new,
breaking areas of neuroscience,

363
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,843
which is the association
between mental health,

364
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,823
mental illness and sleep disruption.

365
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:13,827
We've known for 130 years
that in severe mental illness,

366
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,834
there is always, always sleep disruption,

367
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,821
but it's been largely ignored.

368
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,843
In the 1970s, when people started
to think about this again,

369
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:24,836
they said, "Yes, well, of course
you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia

370
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,839
because they're on anti-psychotics.

371
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,839
It's the anti-psychotics
causing the sleep problems,"

372
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,839
ignoring the fact
that for a hundred years previously,

373
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,838
sleep disruption had been reported
before anti-psychotics.

374
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,833
So what's going on?

375
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,833
Several groups are studying

376
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:45,821
conditions like depression,
schizophrenia and bipolar,

377
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,839
and what's going on
in terms of sleep disruption.

378
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,832
We have a big study which we published
last year on schizophrenia,

379
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,843
and the data were quite extraordinary.

380
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:57,843
In those individuals with schizophrenia,

381
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,839
much of the time, they were awake
during the night phase

382
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,843
and then they were asleep during the day.

383
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,836
Other groups showed
no 24-hour patterns whatsoever.

384
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,833
Their sleep was absolutely smashed.

385
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:12,841
And some had no ability to regulate
their sleep by the light-dark cycle.

386
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,843
They were getting up later
and later and later each night.

387
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,826
It was smashed.

388
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:18,843
So what's going on?

389
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,832
And the really exciting news

390
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:26,837
is that mental illness and sleep
are not simply associated

391
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,828
but they are physically linked
within the brain.

392
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:32,831
The neural networks
that predispose you to normal sleep,

393
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,834
give you normal sleep,

394
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:36,836
and those that give you
normal mental health, are overlapping.

395
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:38,843
And what's the evidence for that?

396
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:41,833
Well, genes that have been shown

397
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,841
to be very important
in the generation of normal sleep,

398
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:46,835
when mutated, when changed,

399
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:49,832
also predispose individuals
to mental health problems.

400
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,843
And last year, we published a study

401
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:55,830
which showed that a gene
that's been linked to schizophrenia,

402
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,839
when mutated, also smashes the sleep.

403
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,833
So we have evidence
of a genuine mechanistic overlap

404
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,838
between these two important systems.

405
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,840
Other work flowed from these studies.

406
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:10,823
The first was that sleep disruption

407
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:13,840
actually precedes
certain types of mental illness,

408
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,832
and we've shown
that in those young individuals

409
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,836
who are at high risk
of developing bipolar disorder,

410
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,824
they already have a sleep abnormality

411
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:25,839
prior to any clinical
diagnosis of bipolar.

412
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:32,822
The other bit of data
was that sleep disruption

413
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:33,836
may actually exacerbate,

414
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:36,828
make worse the mental illness state.

415
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:39,823
My colleague Dan Freeman
has used a range of agents

416
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:42,833
which have stabilized sleep
and reduced levels of paranoia

417
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,839
in those individuals by 50 percent.

418
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:46,840
So what have we got?

419
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:52,821
We've got, in these connections,
some really exciting things.

420
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,826
In terms of the neuroscience,

421
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,820
by understanding these two systems,

422
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,831
we're really beginning to understand
how both sleep and mental illness

423
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,821
are generated and regulated
within the brain.

424
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:05,840
The second area
is that if we can use sleep

425
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,830
and sleep disruption
as an early warning signal,

426
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,837
then we have the chance of going in.

427
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:13,824
If we know that these individuals
are vulnerable,

428
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,836
early intervention then becomes possible.

429
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,821
And the third, which I think
is the most exciting,

430
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:20,841
is that we can think of the sleep
centers within the brain

431
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:22,832
as a new therapeutic target.

432
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,824
Stabilize sleep in those individuals
who are vulnerable,

433
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,828
we can certainly make them healthier,

434
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:32,820
but also alleviate some of the appalling
symptoms of mental illness.

435
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:33,830
So let me just finish.

436
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:36,831
What I started by saying
is take sleep seriously.

437
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,835
Our attitudes toward sleep
are so very different

438
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:40,842
from a pre-industrial age,

439
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:42,843
when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.

440
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,825
We used to understand intuitively
the importance of sleep.

441
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:49,840
And this isn't some sort
of crystal-waving nonsense.

442
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,832
This is a pragmatic response
to good health.

443
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,832
If you have good sleep,
it increases your concentration,

444
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,828
attention, decision-making,
creativity, social skills, health.

445
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:03,837
If you get sleep, it reduces
your mood changes, your stress,

446
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,843
your levels of anger, your impulsivity,

447
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:08,839
and your tendency to drink and take drugs.

448
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,826
And we finished by saying

449
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,830
that an understanding
of the neuroscience of sleep

450
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,825
is really informing the way we think

451
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,839
about some of the causes
of mental illness,

452
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,843
and indeed is providing us new ways

453
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:25,826
to treat these incredibly
debilitating conditions.

454
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:30,831
Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,

455
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,831
"Sleep is God. Go worship."

456
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:34,839
And I can only recommend
that you do the same.

457
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,825
Thank you for your attention.

458
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,826
(Applause)
