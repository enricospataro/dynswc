1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
When I was growing up in Montana,

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I had two dreams.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I wanted to be a paleontologist,

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
a dinosaur paleontologist,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
And so that's what I've been striving for

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
all of my life.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
I was very fortunate

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
early in my career.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
I was fortunate

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
in finding things.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
I wasn't very good at reading things.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
In fact, I don't read much of anything.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
I am extremely dyslexic,

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
and so reading is the hardest thing I do.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
But instead, I go out and I find things.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Then I just pick things up.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
I basically practice for finding money on the street.

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
(Laughter)

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
And I wander about the hills,

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
and I have found a few things.

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
And I have been fortunate enough

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,820
to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,820
and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
the first dinosaur embryos

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,820
and massive accumulations of bones.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And it happened to be at a time

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,820
when people were just starting to begin to realize

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,820
that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
that people had thought for so many years.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
People were starting to get an idea

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
that dinosaurs were special.

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
And so, at that time,

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
along with my colleagues.

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
We were able to actually say

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
that dinosaurs built nests

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
and lived in colonies

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
and cared for their young,

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
brought food to their babies

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
and traveled in gigantic herds.

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
So it was pretty interesting stuff.

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
I have gone on to find more things

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.

46
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
We have found a lot of evidence

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
that dinosaurs changed

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.

49
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
The appearance of them would have been different --

50
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
which it is in all social animals.

51
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
In social groups of animals,

52
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
the juveniles always look different than the adults.

53
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
The adults can recognize the juveniles;

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
the juveniles can recognize the adults.

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
And so we're making a better picture

56
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
of what a dinosaur looks like.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
(Laughter)

59
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
But it is that social thing

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And then Steven Spielberg, of course,

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
depicts these dinosaurs

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
as being very social creatures.

65
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."

67
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people

68
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,820
to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
You all know the story, right.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
If you want to make a dinosaur,

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,820
you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --

73
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
otherwise known as amber --

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
that has some blood-sucking insects in it,

75
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
good ones,

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
and you get your insect and you drill into it

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
and you suck out some DNA,

78
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
sucked dinosaur DNA out.

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory

81
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and you clone it.

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
or something like that,

84
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
and then you wait,

85
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.

86
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
And everybody's happy about that.

87
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
(Laughter)

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And they're happy over and over again.

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And then, then, then, and then ...

91
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Then the dinosaurs, being social,

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
act out their socialness,

93
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
and they get together,

94
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
and they conspire.

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,820
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
So I assume everybody knows

98
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
and you drilled into it,

100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
and you got something out of that insect,

101
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,

102
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
you'd have a room full of mosquitos.

103
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
(Laughter)

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,820
(Applause)

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Now if you want dinosaur DNA,

107
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I say go to the dinosaur.

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
So that's what we've done.

109
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
Back in 1993 when the movie came out,

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation

111
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,

112
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
and we chose the dinosaur on the left,

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.

114
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
And one of my former doctoral students,

115
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
Dr. Mary Schweitzer,

116
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
actually had the background

117
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
to do this sort of thing.

118
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,

119
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
one of the thigh bones,

120
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
and she actually found

121
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
some very interesting structures in there.

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,820
They found these red circular-looking objects,

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
and they looked, for all the world,

124
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
like red blood cells.

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
And they're in

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
what appear to be the blood channels

127
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
that go through the bone.

128
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
And so she thought, well, what the heck.

129
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
So she sampled some material out of it.

130
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.

131
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
But she did find heme,

132
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
which is the biological foundation

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
of hemoglobin.

134
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And that was really cool.

135
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
That was interesting.

136
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,820
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Well we tried and tried

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.

139
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
So a few years went by,

140
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
and then we started the Hell Creek Project.

141
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking

142
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,

143
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
and hopefully find some dinosaurs

144
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
that had more material in them.

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
And out in eastern Montana

146
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,

147
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
and not very many people,

148
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.

149
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And we did find a lot of stuff.

150
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,

151
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
but we found one special Tyrannosaur,

152
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
and we called it B-rex.

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And B-rex was found

154
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
under a thousand cubic yards of rock.

155
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
It wasn't a very complete T. rex,

156
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
and it wasn't a very big T. rex,

157
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
but it was a very special B-rex.

158
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And I and my colleagues cut into it,

159
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
and we were able to determine,

160
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,

161
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
that B-rex had died at the age of 16.

162
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,

163
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
because we haven't found the oldest one yet.

164
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
But this one died at the age of 16.

165
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,

166
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
and she was actually able to determine

167
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
that B-rex was a female

168
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
based on medullary tissue

169
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
found on the inside of the bone.

170
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,

171
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
the calcium storage basically,

172
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
when an animal is pregnant,

173
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
when a bird is pregnant.

174
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
So here was the character

175
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
that linked birds and dinosaurs.

176
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
But Mary went further.

177
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.

178
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Now we all know that bones are fossilized,

179
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
and so if you dump it into acid,

180
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
there shouldn't be anything left.

181
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
But there was something left.

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
There were blood vessels left.

183
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,820
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.

184
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.

185
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
It was extraordinary.

186
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
But she also found osteocytes,

187
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
which are the cells that laid down the bones.

188
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,820
And try and try, we could not find DNA,

189
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
but she did find evidence of proteins.

190
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
But we thought maybe --

191
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
well, we thought maybe

192
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.

193
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.

194
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
And so we built a laboratory

195
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,

196
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
and actually took the laboratory to the field

197
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
where we could get better samples.

198
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,820
And we did. We got better material.

199
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
The cells looked better.

200
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
The vessels looked better.

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Found the protein collagen.

202
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.

203
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
But it's not dinosaur DNA.

204
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
So we have discovered

205
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,

206
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
just breaks down too fast.

207
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
We're just not going to be able

208
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."

209
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur

210
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
based on a dinosaur.

211
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,820
But birds are dinosaurs.

212
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Birds are living dinosaurs.

213
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
We actually classify them

214
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
as dinosaurs.

215
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs

216
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
and avian dinosaurs.

217
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
So the non-avian dinosaurs

218
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
are the big clunky ones that went extinct.

219
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.

220
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
So we don't have to make a dinosaur

221
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
because we already have them.

222
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
(Laughter)

223
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,820
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.

224
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
(Laughter)

225
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."

226
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
(Laughter)

227
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
"You can call it a dinosaur,

228
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."

229
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
(Laughter)

230
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
"The chicken is not."

231
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
(Laughter)

232
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
So this is our problem,

233
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
as you can imagine.

234
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
The chicken is a dinosaur.

235
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
I mean it really is.

236
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
You can't argue with it

237
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.

238
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
(Laughter)

239
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,820
(Applause)

240
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
But the sixth-graders demand it.

241
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
"Fix the chicken."

242
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
(Laughter)

243
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
So that's what I'm here to tell you about:

244
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
how we are going to fix a chicken.

245
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
So we have a number of ways

246
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,820
that we actually can fix the chicken.

247
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Because evolution works,

248
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
we actually have some evolutionary tools.

249
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
We'll call them biological modification tools.

250
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
We have selection.

251
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
And we know selection works.

252
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
We started out with a wolf-like creature

253
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
and we ended up with a Maltese.

254
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I mean, that's --

255
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,820
that's definitely genetic modification.

256
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.

257
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
We also have transgenesis.

258
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Transgenesis is really cool too.

259
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.

260
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
That's how people make GloFish.

261
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
You take a glow gene

262
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,820
out of a coral or a jellyfish

263
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
and you stick it in a zebrafish,

264
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
and, puff, they glow.

265
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
And that's pretty cool.

266
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.

267
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
And now they're making Glow-rabbits

268
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.

269
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
I guess we could make a glow chicken.

270
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
(Laughter)

271
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.

272
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
But there's another thing.

273
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
There's what we call atavism activation.

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
And atavism activation

275
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
is basically --

276
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,820
an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.

277
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
You heard

278
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
that occasionally children are born with tails,

279
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.

280
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And so there are a number of atavisms

281
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
that can happen.

282
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.

283
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
And here's an example.

284
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
This is a chicken with teeth.

285
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris

286
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison

287
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
actually figured out a way to stimulate

288
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
the gene for teeth,

289
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on

290
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
and produce teeth in chickens.

291
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Now that's a good characteristic.

292
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
We can save that one.

293
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
We know we can use that.

294
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
We can make a chicken with teeth.

295
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
That's getting closer.

296
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
That's better than a glowing chicken.

297
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
(Laughter)

298
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,

299
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,

300
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
is actually looking at atavisms.

301
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
And he's looking at them

302
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
by looking at the embryo genesis of birds

303
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
and actually looking at how they develop,

304
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.

305
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
He's also interested in the transformation

306
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
of the arm, the hand, to the wing.

307
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
He's looking for those genes as well.

308
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
And I said, "Well, if you can find those,

309
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I can just reverse them

310
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."

311
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
And so he agreed.

312
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
And so that's what we're looking into.

313
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
If you look at dinosaur hands,

314
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
a velociraptor

315
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.

316
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,

317
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
still has that very primitive hand.

318
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
But as you can see, the pigeon,

319
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
or a chicken or anything else, another bird,

320
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
has kind of a weird-looking hand,

321
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
because the hand is a wing.

322
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
But the cool thing is

323
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
that, if you look in the embryo,

324
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
as the embryo is developing

325
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
the hand actually looks

326
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.

327
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
It has the three fingers, the three digits.

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.

329
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
And so what we're looking for is that gene.

330
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
We want to stop that gene from turning on,

331
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
fusing those hands together,

332
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,

333
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
like the archaeopteryx.

334
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
And the same goes for the tails.

335
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Birds have basically

336
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
rudimentary tails.

337
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
And so we know

338
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
that in embryo,

339
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
as the animal is developing,

340
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
it actually has a relatively long tail.

341
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
But a gene turns on

342
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.

343
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
So that's the other gene we're looking for.

344
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,820
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.

345
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
So what we're trying to do really

346
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
is take our chicken,

347
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
modify it

348
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
and make the chickenosaurus.

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
(Laughter)

350
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
It's a cooler-looking chicken.

351
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
But it's just the very basics.

352
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
So that really is what we're doing.

353
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
And people always say, "Why do that?

354
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Why make this thing?

355
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
What good is it?"

356
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Well, that's a good question.

357
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids

358
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
about evolutionary biology

359
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
and developmental biology

360
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
and all sorts of things.

361
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
And quite frankly, I think

362
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
if Colonel Sanders

363
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
was to be careful how he worded it,

364
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,820
he could actually advertise an extra piece.

365
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,820
(Laughter)

366
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Anyway --

367
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,820
When our dino-chicken hatches,

368
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
it will be, obviously, the poster child,

369
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
or what you might call a poster chick,

370
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
for technology, entertainment and design.

371
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Thank you.

372
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
(Applause)
