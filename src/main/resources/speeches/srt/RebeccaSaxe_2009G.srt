1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
And the problem I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
is not the familiar one from philosophy,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
which is, "How can we know

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
whether other people have minds?"

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
That is, maybe you have a mind,

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
So that's a problem in philosophy,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
but for today's purposes I'm going to assume

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
that many people in this audience have a mind,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
and that I don't have to worry about this.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
as parents and teachers and spouses

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
and novelists,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
which is, "Why is it so hard

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
to know what somebody else wants or believes?"

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Or perhaps, more relevantly,

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
I think novelists put this best.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Like Philip Roth, who said,

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
of other people?

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
So ill equipped are we all,

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
to envision one another's interior workings

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
and invisible aims."

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
So as a teacher and as a spouse,

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
And that problem is, "How is it so easy

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
to know other minds?"

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
So to start with an illustration,

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
you need almost no information,

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
one snapshot of a stranger,

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
to guess what this woman is thinking,

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
or what this man is.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
And put another way, the crux of the problem is

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
that we share with all other animals, with monkeys

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
and mice and even sea slugs.

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
And yet, you put them together in a particular network,

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
is not what I meant."

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
(Laughter)

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience

50
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
is to stand with these ideas,

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
one in each hand.

52
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And to try to understand how you can put together

53
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,820
simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,820
and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.

56
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
Obviously the whole project here is huge.

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
about the discovery of a special brain region

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
for thinking about other people's thoughts.

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Some observations on the slow development of this system

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,820
as we learn how to do this difficult job.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
And then finally, to show that some of the differences

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
between people, in how we judge others,

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,820
can be explained by differences in this brain system.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that

66
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.

68
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
This is a picture of it.

69
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.

70
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
It's above and behind your right ear.

71
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,

72
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
or when you read Romeo and Juliet

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.

74
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,820
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.

75
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And this picture shows the average activation

77
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
in a group of what we call typical human adults.

78
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
They're MIT undergraduates.

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,820
(Laughter)

80
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
The second thing I want to say about this brain system

81
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
is that although we human adults

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
are really good at understanding other minds,

83
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
we weren't always that way.

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
It takes children a long time to break into the system.

85
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,820
I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
as kids learn to understand

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.

89
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old

90
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
who is getting a standard kind of puzzle

91
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
that we call the false belief task.

92
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.

93
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
And you know what pirates really like?

94
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Child: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.

95
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Child: Cheese? I love cheese!

96
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,

97
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
I really love cheese sandwiches."

99
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,820
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."

101
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
And while Ivan is away

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
the wind comes,

104
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.

105
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,820
And now, here comes the other pirate.

106
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
This pirate is called Joshua.

107
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.

108
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,

109
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,820
"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.

111
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Child: So, that one is his.

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.

113
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Child: And then his went on the ground.

114
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
RS: That's exactly right.

115
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Child: So he won't know which one is his.

116
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.

117
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

118
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Child: I think he is going to take that one.

120
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.

121
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.

122
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands

123
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
that other people can have false beliefs

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and what the consequences are for their actions.

125
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old

126
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
who got the same puzzle.

127
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

128
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Which sandwich is he going to take?

129
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.

130
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.

131
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

132
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
And he takes this one.

133
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Child: His was on the grass.

135
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
So the three-year-old does two things differently.

136
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
that's really his.

138
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,820
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,

139
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:

141
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,

142
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
because now it's dirty, on the ground.

143
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.

144
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.

145
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
And we can see the continuation of this process

146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
of learning to think about other people's thoughts

147
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
by upping the ante

148
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
and asking children now, not for an action prediction,

149
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
but for a moral judgment.

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.

151
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?

152
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Child: Yeah.

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?

154
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Child: Yeah.

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan

156
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
to take Joshua's sandwich,

157
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich

158
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.

159
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.

160
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Remember the five-year-old completely understood

161
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.

162
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty

163
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

164
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Child: Um, yeah.

165
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
And so, it is not until age seven

166
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
that we get what looks more like an adult response.

167
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Child: No, because the wind should get in trouble.

169
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
He says the wind should get in trouble

170
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
for switching the sandwiches.

171
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
(Laughter)

172
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
And now what we've started to do in my lab

173
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
is to put children into the brain scanner

174
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
and ask what's going on in their brain

175
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.

176
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,820
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,

177
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
being used while children are thinking about other people.

178
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
But it's not quite like the adult brain.

179
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
So whereas in the adults, as I told you,

180
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
this brain region is almost completely specialized --

181
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --

182
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
in children it's much less so,

183
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
when they are age five to eight,

184
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
the age range of the children I just showed you.

185
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,

186
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
getting into early adolescence,

187
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.

188
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood

189
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
and even into adolescence,

190
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
both the cognitive system,

191
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
our mind's ability to think about other minds,

192
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
and the brain system that supports it

193
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
are continuing, slowly, to develop.

194
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
But of course, as you're probably aware,

195
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
even in adulthood,

196
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
people differ from one another in how good they are

197
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
at thinking of other minds, how often they do it

198
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and how accurately.

199
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults

200
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
in how they think about other people's thoughts

201
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?

202
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version

203
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.

204
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
And I'm going to give that to you now.

205
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,

206
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
and they take a break for coffee.

207
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.

208
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Grace goes to make the coffee

209
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and finds by the coffee a pot

210
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
containing a white powder, which is sugar.

211
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"

212
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.

213
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.

214
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
How many people think it was morally permissible

216
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?

217
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Okay. Good. (Laughter)

218
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed

219
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?

220
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And we can compare that to another case,

221
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
where everything in the real world is the same.

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.

223
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.

224
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar

225
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
and puts it in her friend's coffee,

226
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
people say she deserves no blame at all.

227
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,

228
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
now people say she deserves a lot of blame,

229
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.

230
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame

231
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
in this case, the failed attempt to harm,

232
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
than in another case,

233
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
which we call an accident.

234
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,

235
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,

236
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
but actually the powder was poison.

237
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
So even though when the powder was poison,

238
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
the friend drank the coffee and died,

239
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,

240
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
when she innocently thought it was sugar,

241
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
than in the other case, where she thought it was poison

242
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
and no harm occurred.

243
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
People, though, disagree a little bit

244
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
about exactly how much blame Grace should get

245
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
in the accident case.

246
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Some people think she should deserve more blame,

247
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
and other people less.

248
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside

249
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
the brains of people while they're making that judgment.

250
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
So what I'm showing you, from left to right,

251
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
is how much activity there was in this brain region,

252
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
and from top to bottom, how much blame

253
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
people said that Grace deserved.

254
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
And what you can see is, on the left

255
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
when there was very little activity in this brain region,

256
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
people paid little attention to her innocent belief

257
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.

258
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,

259
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,

260
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and said she deserved a lot less blame

261
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
for causing the accident.

262
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
So that's good, but of course

263
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
what we'd rather is have a way to interfere

264
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
with function in this brain region,

265
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
and see if we could change people's moral judgment.

266
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
And we do have such a tool.

267
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,

268
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
or TMS.

269
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse

270
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,

271
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.

272
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
So I'm going to show you a demo of this.

273
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.

274
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.

275
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.

276
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,

277
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
to the part of my brain that controls my hand.

278
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.

279
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Woman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.

280
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand

281
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.

282
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
And we can use that same pulse,

283
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
now applied to the RTPJ,

284
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.

285
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.

286
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ

287
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
and ask how people's judgments change.

288
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,820
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.

289
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
So their judgments of the case when everything was fine

290
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.

291
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,

292
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,

293
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame

294
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
for putting the powder in the coffee.

295
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,

296
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
but it was really poison and so she caused a death,

297
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,820
people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.

298
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
So what I've told you today is that

299
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
people come, actually, especially well equipped

300
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
to think about other people's thoughts.

301
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
We have a special brain system

302
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
that lets us think about what other people are thinking.

303
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
This system takes a long time to develop,

304
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.

305
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region

306
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
can explain differences among adults

307
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
in how we think about and judge other people.

308
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
But I want to give the last word back to the novelists,

309
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,

310
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
"The fact remains that getting people right

311
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
is not what living is all about anyway.

312
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
It's getting them wrong that is living.

313
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong,

314
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and then on careful reconsideration,

315
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
getting them wrong again."

316
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Thank you.

317
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:46,820
(Applause)

318
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Chris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using

319
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,

320
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
that sounds alarming.

321
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
(Laughter)

322
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.

323
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
RS: I'm not.

324
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.

325
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
(Laughter)

326
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
CA: They really are calling?

327
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,820
So then seriously,

328
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
you must lie awake at night sometimes

329
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
wondering where this work leads.

330
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,

331
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
but someone could take this knowledge

332
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and in some future

333
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
not-torture chamber,

334
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
do acts that people here might be worried about.

335
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
RS: Yeah, we worry about this.

336
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.

337
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.

338
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
So it's not a surreptitious technology.

339
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.

340
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
The changes I showed you are impressive to me

341
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,

342
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
but they're small on the scale

343
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
of the moral judgments that we actually make.

344
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
And what we changed was not people's

345
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
moral judgments when they're deciding what to do,

346
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
when they're making action choices.

347
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.

348
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as

349
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
studying the defendant in a criminal trial,

350
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
but studying the jury.

351
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations

352
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
in education, to perhaps bring up

353
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,820
a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?

354
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.

355
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,820
The whole research program here of studying

356
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.

357
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Until recently, what we knew about the brain

358
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,820
were the things that any other animal's brain could do too,

359
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
so we could study it in animal models.

360
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body

361
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
and how they hear and sense.

362
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
And the whole project of understanding

363
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
how brains do the uniquely human things --

364
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
learn language and abstract concepts,

365
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.

366
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
And we don't know yet what the implications will be

367
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
of understanding it.

368
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
CA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called

369
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
the hard problem of consciousness,

370
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
that puzzles a lot of people.

371
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
The notion that you can understand

372
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
why a brain works, perhaps.

373
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,820
But why does anyone have to feel anything?

374
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things

375
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
for us to operate?

376
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.

377
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
I mean, what chances do you think there are

378
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
that at some time in your career,

379
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
someone, you or someone else,

380
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
is going to come up with some paradigm shift

381
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,820
in understanding what seems an impossible problem?

382
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,820
RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.

383
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
CA: Why?

384
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
RS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.

385
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
(Laughter)

386
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
CA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.

387
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,820
(Applause)
