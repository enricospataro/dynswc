1
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:16,051
There is something you know about me,

2
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:19,891
something very personal,

3
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:24,346
and there is something
I know about every one of you

4
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,318
and that's very central to your concerns.

5
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:31,064
There is something that we know

6
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:37,122
about everyone we meet
anywhere in the world, on the street,

7
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:42,100
that is the very mainspring
of whatever they do

8
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,339
and whatever they put up with.

9
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:51,122
And that is that all of us
want to be happy.

10
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:54,499
In this, we are all together.

11
00:00:55,023 --> 00:01:00,497
How we imagine our happiness,
that differs from one another,

12
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:05,325
but it's already a lot
that we have all in common,

13
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,563
that we want to be happy.

14
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,936
Now my topic is gratefulness.

15
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:17,822
What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness?

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,124
Many people would say,
well, that's very easy.

17
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,666
When you are happy, you are grateful.

18
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,661
But think again.

19
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:33,728
Is it really the happy people
that are grateful?

20
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:38,438
We all know quite a number of people

21
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:42,639
who have everything
that it would take to be happy,

22
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,420
and they are not happy,

23
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:48,159
because they want something else
or they want more of the same.

24
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:56,817
And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune,

25
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:00,618
misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have,

26
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,840
and they are deeply happy.

27
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:06,813
They radiate happiness. You are surprised.

28
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,036
Why? Because they are grateful.

29
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:14,203
So it is not happiness
that makes us grateful.

30
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,742
It's gratefulness that makes us happy.

31
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:20,572
If you think it's happiness
that makes you grateful,

32
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,081
think again.

33
00:02:22,105 --> 00:02:24,359
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.

34
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,601
Now, we can ask,

35
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,086
what do we really mean by gratefulness?

36
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,635
And how does it work?

37
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:39,771
I appeal to your own experience.

38
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,528
We all know from experience how it goes.

39
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,873
We experience something
that's valuable to us.

40
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:52,853
Something is given to us
that's valuable to us.

41
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:55,667
And it's really given.

42
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,910
These two things have to come together.

43
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:03,523
It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift.

44
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:06,690
You haven't bought it.
You haven't earned it.

45
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:09,165
You haven't traded it in.
You haven't worked for it.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,617
It's just given to you.

47
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,884
And when these two things come together,

48
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:18,533
something that's really valuable to me
and I realize it's freely given,

49
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:23,470
then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart,

50
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,138
happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.

51
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,022
That's how gratefulness happens.

52
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:36,761
Now the key to all this

53
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:43,502
is that we cannot only
experience this once in a while.

54
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,551
We cannot only have grateful experiences.

55
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,810
We can be people who live gratefully.

56
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:55,080
Grateful living, that is the thing.

57
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,409
And how can we live gratefully?

58
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:04,316
By experiencing, by becoming aware

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,089
that every moment
is a given moment, as we say.

60
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:11,694
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.

61
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,306
You haven't brought it about in any way.

62
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,713
You have no way of assuring

63
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:20,713
that there will be
another moment given to you,

64
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:25,802
and yet, that's the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us,

65
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:31,314
this moment, with all the opportunity
that it contains.

66
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,978
If we didn't have this present moment,

67
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:37,178
we wouldn't have
any opportunity to do anything

68
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:39,026
or experience anything,

69
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,038
and this moment is a gift.

70
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,974
It's a given moment, as we say.

71
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:50,148
Now, we say the gift within this gift
is really the opportunity.

72
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:54,714
What you are really grateful for
is the opportunity,

73
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:56,672
not the thing that is given to you,

74
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,651
because if that thing were somewhere else

75
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:02,181
and you didn't have
the opportunity to enjoy it,

76
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:04,016
to do something with it,

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,983
you wouldn't be grateful for it.

78
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:10,965
Opportunity is the gift within every gift,

79
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:16,662
and we have this saying,
opportunity knocks only once.

80
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,342
Well, think again.

81
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,686
Every moment is a new gift,
over and over again,

82
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,954
and if you miss the opportunity
of this moment,

83
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:31,560
another moment is given to us,
and another moment.

84
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:34,685
We can avail ourselves
of this opportunity,

85
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,556
or we can miss it,

86
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,490
and if we avail ourselves
of the opportunity,

87
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,307
it is the key to happiness.

88
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,572
Behold the master key to our happiness

89
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,375
in our own hands.

90
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,096
Moment by moment,
we can be grateful for this gift.

91
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,912
Does that mean

92
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,647
that we can be grateful for everything?

93
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,036
Certainly not.

94
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:06,333
We cannot be grateful
for violence, for war,

95
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,824
for oppression, for exploitation.

96
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,919
On the personal level,
we cannot be grateful

97
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:15,220
for the loss of a friend,
for unfaithfulness,

98
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,966
for bereavement.

99
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:22,323
But I didn't say
we can be grateful for everything.

100
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:26,829
I said we can be grateful
in every given moment

101
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,683
for the opportunity,

102
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:35,102
and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult,

103
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,642
we can rise to this occasion

104
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,897
and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us.

105
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,272
It isn't as bad as it might seem.

106
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:48,165
Actually, when you look at it
and experience it,

107
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,121
you find that most of the time,

108
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,854
what is given to us
is the opportunity to enjoy,

109
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:57,895
and we only miss it
because we are rushing through life

110
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,322
and we are not stopping
to see the opportunity.

111
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:03,146
But once in a while,

112
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,092
something very difficult is given to us,

113
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:10,183
and when this difficult thing
occurs to us,

114
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:14,511
it's a challenge to rise
to that opportunity,

115
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,931
and we can rise to it
by learning something

116
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,672
which is sometimes painful.

117
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,759
Learning patience, for instance.

118
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:24,756
We have been told that the road to peace

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,524
is not a sprint,
but is more like a marathon.

120
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,085
That takes patience. That's difficult.

121
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:38,350
It may be to stand up for your opinion,
to stand up for your conviction.

122
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,683
That's an opportunity that is given to us.

123
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:45,559
To learn, to suffer, to stand up,

124
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,929
all these opportunities are given to us,

125
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,435
but they are opportunities,

126
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,311
and those who avail themselves
of those opportunities

127
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,438
are the ones that we admire.

128
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,710
They make something out of life.

129
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:02,462
And those who fail
get another opportunity.

130
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,036
We always get another opportunity.

131
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,117
That's the wonderful richness of life.

132
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:16,617
So how can we find a method
that will harness this?

133
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:21,647
How can each one of us find a method
for living gratefully,

134
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:23,576
not just once in a while being grateful,

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,008
but moment by moment to be grateful.

136
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:29,763
How can we do it?
It's a very simple method.

137
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:34,850
It's so simple that it's actually
what we were told as children

138
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,179
when we learned to cross the street.

139
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:38,941
Stop.

140
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,442
Look.

141
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,667
Go.

142
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,066
That's all.

143
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,463
But how often do we stop?

144
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,547
We rush through life. We don't stop.

145
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,969
We miss the opportunity
because we don't stop.

146
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,160
We have to stop.

147
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,536
We have to get quiet.

148
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:02,750
And we have to build
stop signs into our lives.

149
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:08,416
When I was in Africa
some years ago and then came back,

150
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,544
I noticed water.

151
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:15,089
In Africa where I was,
I didn't have drinkable water.

152
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:19,069
Every time I turned on the faucet,
I was overwhelmed.

153
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:23,472
Every time I clicked on the light,
I was so grateful.

154
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,037
It made me so happy.

155
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,044
But after a while, this wears off.

156
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,830
So I put little stickers
on the light switch

157
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,531
and on the water faucet,

158
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:35,011
and every time I turned it on, water.

159
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:38,493
So leave it up to your own imagination.

160
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,470
You can find whatever works best for you,

161
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,756
but you need stop signs in your life.

162
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:46,025
And when you stop,

163
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:48,129
then the next thing is to look.

164
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,781
You look. You open your eyes.

165
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,067
You open your ears. You open your nose.

166
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:55,487
You open all your senses

167
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,742
for this wonderful richness
that is given to us.

168
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:03,098
There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about,

169
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:06,728
to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.

170
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:09,571
And then we can also open our hearts,

171
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,417
our hearts for the opportunities,

172
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:15,659
for the opportunities also to help others,

173
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,954
to make others happy,

174
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:21,086
because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy.

175
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:26,697
And when we open
our hearts to the opportunities,

176
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:30,337
the opportunities invite us
to do something,

177
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,684
and that is the third.

178
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,798
Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something.

179
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,751
And what we can do

180
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:42,437
is whatever life offers to you
in that present moment.

181
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:47,504
Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,

182
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:50,904
but sometimes
it's something more difficult.

183
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:55,196
But whatever it is,
if we take this opportunity,

184
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,667
we go with it, we are creative,
those are the creative people.

185
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:04,540
And that little stop, look, go,

186
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,794
is such a potent seed

187
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:09,889
that it can revolutionize our world.

188
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,616
Because we are at the present moment

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,952
in the middle of a change
of consciousness,

190
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:21,517
and you will be surprised if you --

191
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,484
I am always surprised
when I hear how many times

192
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,412
this word "gratefulness"
and "gratitude" comes up.

193
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,086
Everywhere you find it,

194
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,365
a grateful airline,
a restaurant gratefulness,

195
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,574
a café gratefulness,
a wine that is gratefulness.

196
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:38,849
Yes, I have even come across
a toilet paper

197
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:41,216
whose brand is called "Thank You."

198
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,836
(Laughter)

199
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,802
There is a wave of gratefulness

200
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:48,608
because people are becoming aware
how important this is

201
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:51,228
and how this can change our world.

202
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:58,320
It can change our world
in immensely important ways,

203
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:01,931
because if you're grateful,
you're not fearful,

204
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,317
and if you're not fearful,
you're not violent.

205
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:09,503
If you're grateful,
you act out of a sense of enough

206
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,597
and not of a sense of scarcity,

207
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,646
and you are willing to share.

208
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,938
If you are grateful,

209
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,813
you are enjoying
the differences between people,

210
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,192
and you are respectful to everybody,

211
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,925
and that changes this power pyramid
under which we live.

212
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:28,953
And it doesn't make for equality,
but it makes for equal respect,

213
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,957
and that is the important thing.

214
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:34,657
The future of the world will be a network,

215
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:38,307
not a pyramid turned upside down.

216
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:42,819
The revolution of which I am speaking
is a nonviolent revolution,

217
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:46,708
and it's so revolutionary
that it even revolutionizes

218
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,889
the very concept of a revolution,

219
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:51,150
because the normal revolution

220
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,158
is one where the power pyramid
is turned upside down

221
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:57,327
and those who were on the bottom
are now on the top

222
00:12:57,351 --> 00:13:01,477
and are doing exactly the same thing
that the ones before.

223
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:06,378
What we need is a networking
of smaller groups,

224
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:10,048
smaller and smaller groups
who know one another,

225
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:14,619
who interact with one another,
and that is a grateful world.

226
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:18,767
A grateful world
is a world of joyful people.

227
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,438
Grateful people are joyful people,

228
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:23,479
and joyful people --

229
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,242
the more and more joyful people there are,

230
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,540
the more and more
we'll have a joyful world.

231
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:36,625
We have a network for grateful living,
and it has mushroomed.

232
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,072
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.

233
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:42,408
We have an opportunity
for people to light a candle

234
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,593
when they are grateful for something.

235
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:51,458
And there have been
15 million candles lit in one decade.

236
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:58,093
People are becoming aware
that a grateful world is a happy world,

237
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:04,119
and we all have the opportunity
by the simple stop, look, go,

238
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,855
to transform the world,
to make it a happy place.

239
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,357
And that is what I hope for us,

240
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,255
and if this has contributed a little
to making you want to do the same,

241
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,917
stop, look, go.

242
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,110
Thank you.

243
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:20,498
(Applause)
