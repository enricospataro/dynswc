1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
and I started in the context

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
of developing countries,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
So if you think of a map of your country,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
I think you'll realize

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
that for every country on Earth,

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
you could draw little circles to say,

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
"These are places where good teachers won't go."

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
On top of that,

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
those are the places from where trouble comes.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
So we have an ironic problem --

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
good teachers don't want to go

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
to just those places where they're needed the most.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I started in 1999

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
to try and address this problem with an experiment,

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,820
I basically embedded a computer

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
they'd never seen a computer before,

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
and they didn't know what the internet was.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
turned it on and left it there.

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
After this,

27
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,820
But I repeated this all over India

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
and then through

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
a large part of the world

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and noticed

32
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
that children will learn to do

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
what they want to learn to do.

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
This is the first experiment that we did --

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
eight year-old boy on your right

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
teaching his student, a six year-old girl,

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
and he was teaching her how to browse.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
This boy here in the middle of central India --

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
this is in a Rajasthan village,

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
where the children recorded their own music

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
and then played it back to each other

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and in the process,

43
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
They did all of this in four hours

45
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
after seeing the computer for the first time.

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
In another South Indian village,

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
these boys here

48
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
had assembled a video camera

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
They downloaded it from Disney.com,

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
or one of these websites,

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
14 days after putting the computer in their village.

53
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
So at the end of it,

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
we concluded that groups of children

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,

56
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
irrespective of who

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
or where they were.

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
At that point, I became a little more ambitious

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
and decided to see

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
what else could children do with a computer.

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
where I gave a group of children --

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.

64
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I gave them a computer

65
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
with a speech-to-text interface,

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
which you now get free with Windows,

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
and asked them to speak into it.

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
So when they spoke into it,

69
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
the computer typed out gibberish,

70
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."

71
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Make yourself understood

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
to the computer."

74
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
So the children said, "How do we do that."

75
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
And I said,

76
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
"I don't know, actually."

77
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
(Laughter)

78
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
And I left.

79
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
(Laughter)

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Two months later --

81
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
and this is now documented

82
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
in the Information Technology

83
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
for International Development journal --

84
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
that accents had changed

85
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent

86
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.

87
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.

88
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
(Laughter)

89
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
So they could do that on their own.

90
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
After that, I started to experiment

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
with various other things

92
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
that they might learn to do on their own.

93
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
from the late Arthur C. Clarke,

95
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
who said, "I want to see what's going on."

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.

97
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
He said two interesting things,

98
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,820
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
(Laughter)

100
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
The second thing he said was that,

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
"If children have interest,

102
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
then education happens."

103
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And I was doing that in the field,

104
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
so every time I would watch it and think of him.

105
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
help people,

107
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
because children quickly learn to navigate

108
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
the web and find things which interest them.

109
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
And when you've got interest, then you have education.

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.

111
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
This is a 15 year-old boy.

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
like animals,

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
and I listen to music.

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"

116
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."

117
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
This is in Cambodia,

118
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
rural Cambodia --

119
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
a fairly silly arithmetic game,

120
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.

121
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
They would, you know, throw it back at you.

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
They'd say, "This is very boring."

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
If you leave it on the pavement

124
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
and if all the adults go away,

125
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
then they will show off with each other

126
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
about what they can do.

127
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
This is what these children are doing.

128
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
They are trying to multiply, I think.

129
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
And all over India,

130
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
at the end of about two years,

131
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
children were beginning to Google their homework.

132
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
As a result, the teachers reported

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
tremendous improvements in their English --

134
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
(Laughter)

135
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
rapid improvement and all sorts of things.

136
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.

137
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
(Laughter)

138
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
And indeed they had.

139
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I mean, if there's stuff on Google,

140
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
why would you need to stuff it into your head?

141
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
So at the end of the next four years,

142
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
to achieve educational objectives on their own.

144
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
At that time, a large amount of money

145
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
had come into Newcastle University

146
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
to improve schooling in India.

147
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."

148
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle

149
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
a million pounds-worth of University money

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
sitting in Delhi."

151
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
So in 2006,

152
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
I bought myself a heavy overcoat

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and moved to Newcastle.

154
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
I wanted to test the limits

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
of the system.

156
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle

157
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
was actually done in India.

158
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
And I set myself and impossible target:

159
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
can Tamil speaking

160
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
12-year-old children

161
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,820
in a South Indian village

162
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
teach themselves biotechnology

163
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
in English on their own?

164
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --

165
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --

166
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
they get another zero,

167
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,820
I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
I called in 26 children.

169
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
They all came in there, and I told them

170
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.

171
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.

172
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
It's all in English, and I'm going.

173
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
(Laughter)

174
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
So I left them with it.

175
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
I came back after two months,

176
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.

177
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"

178
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
They said, "Yes, we did."

179
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."

180
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
So I said,

181
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
"Well, how long did you practice on it

182
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
before you decided you understood nothing?"

183
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
They said, "We look at it every day."

184
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"

185
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,

186
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
literally,

187
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule

188
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
causes genetic disease,

189
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
we've understood nothing else."

190
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
(Laughter)

191
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,820
(Applause)

192
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
(Laughter)

193
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
It took me three years to publish that.

194
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.

195
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
One of the referees who refereed the paper said,

196
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
"It's too good to be true,"

197
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
which was not very nice.

198
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Well, one of the girls had taught herself

199
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
to become the teacher.

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
And then that's her over there.

201
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Remember, they don't study English.

202
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"

204
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
and then she looked and did this.

205
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.

206
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,

207
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.

208
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
But 30 percent is not a pass.

209
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
So I found that they had a friend,

210
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
a local accountant, a young girl,

211
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and they played football with her.

212
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them

213
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
enough biotechnology to pass?"

214
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."

215
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."

216
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
She said, "What's that?"

217
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
I said, "Well, what you've got to do

218
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
is stand behind them

219
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and admire them all the time.

220
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.

221
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"

222
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
She did that for two months.

223
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
The scores went up to 50,

224
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,

225
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.

226
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
So I came back to Newcastle

227
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
with these results

228
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
and decided

229
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
that there was something happening here

230
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
that definitely was getting very serious.

231
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,

232
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I came to the most remote place that I could think of.

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
(Laughter)

234
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi

235
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
is the little town of Gateshead.

236
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
In Gateshead, I took 32 children

237
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
and I started to fine-tune the method.

238
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
I made them into groups of four.

239
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
I said, "You make your own groups of four.

240
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."

241
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.

242
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
"You can exchange groups.

243
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
You can walk across to another group,

244
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
if you don't like your group, etc.

245
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,

246
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."

247
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
And I explained to them

248
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.

249
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
(Laughter)

250
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,820
(Applause)

251
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
The children enthusiastically got after me and said,

252
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
"Now, what do you want us to do?"

253
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
I gave them six GCSE questions.

254
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
The first group -- the best one --

255
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
solved everything in 20 minutes.

256
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
The worst, in 45.

257
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
They used everything that they knew --

258
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
news groups, Google, Wikipedia,

259
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Ask Jeeves, etc.

260
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"

261
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
I said, "Well, let's try it.

262
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
I'll come back after two months.

263
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
We'll give them a paper test --

264
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
no computers, no talking to each other, etc."

265
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups

266
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
was 76 percent.

267
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
When I did the experiment, when I did the test,

268
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
after two months, the score

269
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
was 76 percent.

270
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
There was photographic recall

271
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
inside the children,

272
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
I suspect because they're discussing with each other.

273
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
A single child in front of a single computer

274
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
will not do that.

275
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
I have further results,

276
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
which are almost unbelievable,

277
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
of scores which go up with time.

278
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Because their teachers say

279
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
that after the session is over,

280
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
the children continue to Google further.

281
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Here in Britain, I put out a call

282
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
for British grandmothers,

283
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
after my Kuppam experiment.

284
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Well, you know,

285
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.

286
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
200 of them volunteered immediately.

287
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
(Laughter)

288
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
The deal was that they would give me

289
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
one hour of broadband time,

290
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
sitting in their homes,

291
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
one day in a week.

292
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
So they did that,

293
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
and over the last two years,

294
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
over 600 hours of instruction

295
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
has happened over Skype,

296
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
using what my students call the granny cloud.

297
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
The granny cloud sits over there.

298
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.

299
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.

300
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
You say it.

301
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
You can't catch me.

302
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Children: You can't catch me.

303
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man.

304
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Children: I'm the gingerbread man.

305
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Teacher: Well done. Very good ...

306
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
SM: Back at Gateshead,

307
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism

308
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
in 15 minutes.

309
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.

310
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Two children watch a TEDTalk.

311
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
They wanted to be footballers before.

312
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
After watching eight TEDTalks,

313
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.

314
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
(Laughter)

315
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
(Applause)

316
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
It's pretty simple stuff.

317
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
This is what I'm building now --

318
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.

319
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
The furniture is designed

320
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,

321
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
big broadband connections, but in groups.

322
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.

323
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.

324
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
The mediator is from Pune, India.

325
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.

326
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I went to Turin in May.

327
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.

328
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
I speak only English, they speak only Italian,

329
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
so we had no way to communicate.

330
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.

331
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
The children looked at it and said, "What?"

332
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I said, "Well, do it."

333
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,

334
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
went back into Italian Google.

335
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Fifteen minutes later --

336
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
next question: where is Calcutta?

337
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
This one, they took only 10 minutes.

338
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I tried a really hard one then.

339
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?

340
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
There was silence for a while,

341
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.

342
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
It's Pitagora."

343
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
And then,

344
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
in 20 minutes,

345
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.

346
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
This sent shivers up my spine.

347
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
These are 10 year-olds.

348
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?

349
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
(Laughter)

350
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:57,820
(Applause)

351
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
SM: So you know what's happened?

352
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I think we've just stumbled across

353
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
a self-organizing system.

354
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
A self-organizing system is one

355
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
where a structure appears

356
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
without explicit intervention from the outside.

357
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
which is that the system starts to do things,

359
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
which it was never designed for.

360
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Which is why you react the way you do,

361
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
because it looks impossible.

362
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
I think I can make a guess now --

363
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
education is self-organizing system,

364
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
where learning is an emergent phenomenon.

365
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,

366
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
but I'm going to try.

367
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.

368
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --

369
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
there are many more than that on the planet --

370
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
10 million SOLEs,

371
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
180 billion dollars and 10 years.

372
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
We could change everything.

373
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Thanks.

374
00:16:51,820 --> 00:17:02,820
(Applause)
