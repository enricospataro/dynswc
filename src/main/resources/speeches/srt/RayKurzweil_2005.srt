1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,820
Well, it's great to be here.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,820
We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
I've been quite interested in both.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,820
If we could convert 0.03 percent

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,820
we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
expensive and very inefficient.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
There are nano-engineered designs,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
which at least have been analyzed theoretically,

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
that show the potential to be very lightweight,

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
very inexpensive, very efficient,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Nano-engineered fuel cells

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
could provide the energy where it's needed.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
That's a key trend, which is decentralization,

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
moving from centralized nuclear power plants and

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
liquid natural gas tankers

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,820
to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
a lot more efficient

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and capable and safe from disruption.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Bono spoke very eloquently,

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,820
that we have the tools, for the first time,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,820
to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,820
Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,820
In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
there were 500 million people living in poverty --

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
that number now is under 200 million.

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
which is a reduction of 95 percent.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
I did enjoy Bono's comment

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,820
linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
although we hung around Harvard Square.

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,820
But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
That's been a strong interest of mine,

40
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.

41
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,820
I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
That invariably, the world was a different place

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
when I would introduce a technology.

44
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
And, I noticed that most inventions fail,

45
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
not because the R&D department can't get it to work --

46
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --

49
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,820
So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,

51
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
and track where technology would be at different points in time,

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
and began to build the mathematical models of that.

53
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
It's kind of taken on a life of its own.

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,820
on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And if you ask me,

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,

59
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
that's very hard to say.

60
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Will WiMax CDMA G3

61
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
But if you ask me, what will it cost

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
for one MIPS of computing in 2010,

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,820
or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,

65
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,820
or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,

66
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
it turns out that those are very predictable.

67
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
There are remarkably smooth exponential curves

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,

70
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
but there's really a theoretical reason

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,820
why technology develops in an exponential fashion.

72
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.

73
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
They think they're going to continue

74
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
to develop a problem

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
or address a problem using today's tools,

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
at today's pace of progress,

77
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
We had our best Ph.D. students,

80
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
our most advanced equipment around the world,

81
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
we got 1/10,000th of the project done,

82
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?

83
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And 10 years into the project,

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
the skeptics were still going strong -- says, "You're two-thirds through this project,

85
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
and you've managed to only sequence

86
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
a very tiny percentage of the whole genome."

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
But it's the nature of exponential growth

88
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Most of the project was done in the last

90
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
few years of the project.

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --

92
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
we sequenced SARS in 31 days.

93
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,820
So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.

94
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
I'm going to show you just a few examples

95
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,820
of how pervasive this phenomena is.

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,

97
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
is doubling every decade, according to our models.

98
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
These are all logarithmic graphs,

99
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.

100
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,820
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,

101
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
the first virtual-reality technology.

102
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.

103
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
If you put different communication technologies

104
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
on this logarithmic graph,

105
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
television, radio, telephone

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
were adopted in decades.

107
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --

108
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
were under a decade.

109
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Now this is an interesting chart,

110
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and this really gets at the fundamental reason why

111
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,820
an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --

112
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
accelerate.

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
They work through interaction -- they create a capability,

114
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.

115
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
So the first step in biological evolution,

116
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --

117
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
took billions of years,

118
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
but then evolution used that information-processing backbone

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
to bring on the next stage.

120
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,

121
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.

122
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
And then evolution used those body plans

123
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
to evolve higher cognitive functions,

124
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
and biological evolution kept accelerating.

125
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.

126
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,

127
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
the species that combined a cognitive function

128
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
with an opposable appendage --

129
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --

130
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip

131
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
and fine motor coordination,

132
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and use our mental models to actually change the world

133
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
and bring on technology.

134
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,820
But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
and then working through interaction,

136
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
evolution used, essentially,

137
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,

138
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
which were the first steps in technological evolution.

139
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
And the first step took tens of thousands of years --

140
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.

141
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
We always used then the latest generation of technology

142
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
to create the next generation.

143
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Printing press took a century to be adopted;

144
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,820
the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.

145
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.

146
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,

147
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,820
but some observer says, "Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph

148
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
that fall on that straight line."

149
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,

150
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,820
like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar

151
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;

152
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
these were just lists in reference works,

153
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,820
and I think that's what they thought the key events were

154
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
in biological evolution and technological evolution.

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line

156
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
because people do have disagreements, what the key points are,

157
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,

158
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.

159
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
But you see a very clear trend.

160
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,820
There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.

161
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,

162
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
every year.

163
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,820
And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.

164
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
A personal experience, when I was at MIT --

165
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
computer taking up about the size of this room,

166
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,820
less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.

167
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
is just one example of many, because it's basically

169
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,820
a property of the evolutionary process of technology.

170
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --

171
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,820
by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --

172
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
that's another exponential.

173
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,

174
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.

175
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.

176
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Moore's Law was just the last part of that,

177
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
but we had electro-mechanical calculators,

179
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,

180
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,820
vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,

181
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
discreet transistors used in the first space flights

182
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and then Moore's Law.

183
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,

184
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.

185
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.

186
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.

187
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.

188
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,

189
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.

190
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law

191
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.

192
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
But by the teen years,

193
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,

194
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
and we won't be able to shrink them any more.

195
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of

196
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.

197
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.

198
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
We will go into the third dimension

199
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,820
of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.

201
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,820
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.

202
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Supercomputers -- same thing.

203
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Processor performance on Intel chips,

204
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
the average price of a transistor --

205
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar.

206
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
You could buy 10 million in 2002.

207
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
It's pretty remarkable how smooth

208
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
an exponential process that is.

209
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,

210
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --

211
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
countries accusing each other of dumping products,

212
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.

213
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
You would think it would be a very erratic process,

214
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
and you have a very smooth

215
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
outcome of this chaotic process.

216
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Just as we can't predict

217
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
what one molecule in a gas will do --

218
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,820
it's hopeless to predict a single molecule --

219
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,

220
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
using thermodynamics, very accurately.

221
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,

222
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
but the result of this whole worldwide,

223
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,820
chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition

224
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.

225
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
And we can predict these trends far into the future.

226
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.

228
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
As we make them smaller and less expensive,

229
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
the electrons have less distance to travel.

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,820
They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,

231
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
so the cost of a cycle of one transistor

232
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.

233
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
You add other forms of innovation and processor design,

234
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.

235
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
And that's basically deflation --

236
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
50 percent deflation.

237
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;

238
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
it's true of brain scanning;

239
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,

240
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
we have hundreds of different measurements

241
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
of different, information-related measurements --

242
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
capacity, adoption rates --

243
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,

244
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
depending on what you're looking at.

245
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,820
In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
And economists have actually started worrying about that.

247
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
We had deflation during the Depression,

248
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
but that was collapse of the money supply,

249
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.

250
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
This is due to greater productivity,

251
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
but the economist says, "But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that.

252
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume

253
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
30, 40 percent, but they won't keep up with it."

254
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
But what we're actually seeing is that

255
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
we actually more than keep up with it.

256
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars

257
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
in information technology over the last 50 years.

258
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.

259
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
As the price performance makes new applications feasible,

260
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
new applications come to the market.

261
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And this is a very widespread phenomena.

262
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Magnetic data storage --

263
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,

264
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,820
different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.

265
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology

266
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
in these information terms.

267
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
We're understanding the software programs

268
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
that make our body run.

269
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
These were evolved in very different times --

270
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
we'd like to actually change those programs.

271
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,

272
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
basically says, "Hold onto every calorie,

273
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
because the next hunting season may not work out so well."

274
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.

275
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
We'd like to actually turn that program off.

276
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously

277
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.

278
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;

279
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction

280
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
without the restriction.

281
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,

282
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
felt that would be

283
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
interesting drug for the human market,

284
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
and that's just one of the 30,000 genes

285
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
that affect our biochemistry.

286
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people

287
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
at the age of most people at this conference, like myself,

288
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,820
to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources

289
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
which were better deployed towards the children

290
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
and those caring for them.

291
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
So, life -- long lifespans --

292
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
like, that is to say, much more than 30 --

293
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
weren't selected for,

294
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
but we are learning to actually manipulate

295
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
and change these software programs

296
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
through the biotechnology revolution.

297
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,820
For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.

298
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy

299
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material

300
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
in the right place on the chromosome.

301
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
There's actually a -- for the first time now,

302
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --

303
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.

304
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.

305
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
And this technology is also accelerating.

306
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,

307
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
then a penny in 2000.

308
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
It's now under a 10th of a cent.

309
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
The amount of genetic data --

310
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
basically this shows that smooth exponential growth

311
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
doubled every year,

312
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
enabling the genome project to be completed.

313
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
Another major revolution: the communications revolution.

314
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,820
The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;

315
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
wired, wireless is growing exponentially.

316
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,

317
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
measured many different ways.

318
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
This is based on the number of hosts.

319
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology

320
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
at an exponential rate,

321
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
both wired and wireless.

322
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,820
These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --

323
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
which we're now showing are feasible

324
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
with super-computing simulations,

325
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
where actually there are scientists building

326
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
molecule-scale robots.

327
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,

328
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
that's built out of molecules.

329
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,820
There are little machines doing things in experimental bases.

330
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
The most exciting opportunity

331
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
is actually to go inside the human body

332
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.

333
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
And this is less futuristic than it may sound.

334
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
These things have already been done in animals.

335
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,820
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.

336
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
They put tens of thousands of these

337
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --

338
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,

339
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
and actually cures type 1 diabetes.

340
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
What you're watching is a design

341
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
of a robotic red blood cell,

342
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
and it does bring up the issue that our biology

343
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
is actually very sub-optimal,

344
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.

345
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Once we understand its principles of operation,

346
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,

347
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
we can actually design these things to be

348
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
thousands of times more capable.

349
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,820
An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,

350
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,

351
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.

352
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --

353
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,820
so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning.

354
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.

355
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Presumably we'll ban them,

356
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms

357
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.

358
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.

359
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,820
These are 2020-circa scenarios,

360
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.

361
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;

362
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
there are many experiments in animals.

363
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
There's actually one going into human trial,

364
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
so this is feasible technology.

365
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
If we come back to our exponential growth of computing,

366
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.

367
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
It will intersect human intelligence

368
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
in terms of capacity in the 2020s,

369
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.

370
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Where will we get the software?

371
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,

372
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
and in fact not surprisingly,

373
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,820
the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

374
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
And with the new generation of scanning tools,

375
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
for the first time we can actually see

376
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
individual inter-neural fibers

377
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
and see them processing and signaling in real time --

378
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,

379
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
but can we understand it?

380
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence

381
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,820
just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,

382
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,

383
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
and we'd never catch up to it.

384
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
It turns out that we can understand it.

385
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
This is a block diagram of

386
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,820
a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex

387
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
that actually works quite well --

388
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.

389
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
There's another simulation of the cerebellum --

390
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
that's more than half the neurons in the brain --

391
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
again, works very similarly to human skill formation.

392
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,820
This is at an early stage, but you can show

393
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain

394
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
and the exponential improvement

395
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
in the resolution of brain scanning,

396
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,820
we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain

397
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
by the 2020s.

398
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions

399
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,820
out of the several hundred.

400
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
All of this is driving

401
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
exponentially growing economic progress.

402
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour

403
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
of labor in the last 50 years.

404
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.

405
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?

406
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.

407
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,

408
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,

409
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
they figured, well, that was wrong,

410
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
and then we had this bust.

411
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
All right, this is a technology

412
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.

413
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.

414
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
It would be able to translate from one language to another.

415
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.

416
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
By 2010 computers will disappear.

417
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,820
They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.

418
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Images will be written directly to our retina,

419
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
providing full-immersion virtual reality,

420
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,820
augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.

421
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,820
But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,

422
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,820
and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw

423
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,820
in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.

424
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power

425
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth

426
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.

427
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.

428
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,

429
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,820
1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful

430
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,820
than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.

431
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Computers will combine

432
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
the subtle pan-recognition powers

433
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,

434
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
in terms of doing analytic thinking,

435
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
remembering billions of facts accurately.

436
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.

437
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,820
But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.

438
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
We are going to merge with our technology.

439
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
These nano-bots I mentioned

440
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,820
will first be used for medical and health applications:

441
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells

442
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,820
and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.

443
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
But they'll also go inside our brain,

444
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
interact with our biological neurons.

445
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.

446
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
So, for example,

447
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,

448
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,820
the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,

449
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,820
replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving

450
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
if you were in the virtual environment,

451
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.

452
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience

453
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
with anyone involving all of the senses.

454
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
"Experience beamers," I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences

455
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,820
in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.

456
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.

457
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
But most importantly,

458
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
it'll be a tremendous expansion

459
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,820
of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,

460
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
which in some sense we're doing already.

461
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
We routinely do intellectual feats

462
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
that would be impossible without our technology.

463
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,

464
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,820
and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,

465
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
this will move up very rapidly

466
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
in the years ahead.

467
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
My main message is that progress in technology

468
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,820
is exponential, not linear.

469
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,

470
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
so they'll say, "Oh, it'll be hundreds of years

471
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,820
before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly

472
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
or artificial intelligence."

473
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
If you really look at the power of exponential growth,

474
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.

475
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
And information technology is increasingly encompassing

476
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,820
all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing

477
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,820
to our biology to our energy to materials.

478
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,

479
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
from information, in very inexpensive raw materials,

480
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,820
using nano-technology.

481
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
These are very powerful technologies.

482
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,820
They both empower our promise and our peril.

483
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,820
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.

484
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Thank you very much.

485
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
(Applause)
