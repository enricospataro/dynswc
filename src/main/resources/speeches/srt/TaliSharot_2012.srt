1
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,350
I'm going to talk to you about optimism --

2
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,833
or more precisely, the optimism bias.

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,478
It's a cognitive illusion

4
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,220
that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,955
and 80 percent of us have it.

6
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,689
It's our tendency to overestimate

7
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,612
our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:33,720
and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,737
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,

10
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,243
being in a car accident.

11
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,429
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.

12
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,874
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,

13
00:00:44,874 --> 00:00:47,036
but we are oblivious to the fact.

14
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:49,263
Take marriage for example.

15
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:52,797
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.

16
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:56,266
That means that out of five married couples,

17
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,987
two will end up splitting their assets.

18
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:02,362
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,

19
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,054
they estimate it at zero percent.

20
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:09,783
And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,

21
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:13,632
hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.

22
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:16,758
So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,

23
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:19,288
but they are more likely to remarry.

24
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,591
In the words of Samuel Johnson,

25
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:25,588
"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."

26
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,550
(Laughter)

27
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,124
So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.

28
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:35,389
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.

29
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,987
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.

30
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,362
And I just want to make it absolutely clear

31
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:43,133
that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,

32
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,945
because he is in fact uniquely talented.

33
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:47,380
(Laughter)

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,987
And I'm not alone.

35
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,462
Out of four British people, three said

36
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:55,201
that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.

37
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,952
That's 75 percent.

38
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,010
But only 30 percent said

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,570
that they thought families in general

40
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,982
are doing better than a few generations ago.

41
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:06,003
And this is a really important point,

42
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,891
because we're optimistic about ourselves,

43
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,709
we're optimistic about our kids,

44
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,497
we're optimistic about our families,

45
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,680
but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,909
and we're somewhat pessimistic

47
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,788
about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.

48
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:24,824
But private optimism about our own personal future

49
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:26,835
remains persistent.

50
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:30,901
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,

51
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,933
but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.

52
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,774
Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.

53
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,566
So to show you what I mean,

54
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:42,368
I'm going to do an experiment here with you.

55
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:46,218
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,

56
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:49,112
and I want you to think for each of these abilities

57
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:53,505
where you stand relative to the rest of the population.

58
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:57,291
The first one is getting along well with others.

59
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:02,943
Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?

60
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:07,265
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.

61
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:11,278
Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?

62
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,988
That's most of us here.

63
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:18,918
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.

64
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:21,501
How interesting are you?

65
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,345
How attractive are you?

66
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,299
How honest are you?

67
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,299
And finally, how modest are you?

68
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,987
So most of us put ourselves above average

69
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:37,016
on most of these abilities.

70
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,147
Now this is statistically impossible.

71
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,376
We can't all be better than everyone else.

72
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,018
(Laughter)

73
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:46,695
But if we believe we're better than the other guy,

74
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:50,778
well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,

75
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:53,376
because we're more social, more interesting.

76
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,539
And it's a global phenomenon.

77
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,007
The optimism bias has been observed

78
00:03:58,007 --> 00:03:59,726
in many different countries --

79
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:02,830
in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,336
in females and males,

81
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,060
in kids, in the elderly.

82
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,843
It's quite widespread.

83
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:11,343
But the question is, is it good for us?

84
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:13,797
So some people say no.

85
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:16,315
Some people say the secret to happiness

86
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:19,068
is low expectations.

87
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,572
I think the logic goes something like this:

88
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:23,830
If we don't expect greatness,

89
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,710
if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,

90
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,808
well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.

91
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:34,216
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,

92
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:36,195
and we're pleasantly surprised when they do,

93
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,976
we will be happy.

94
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,678
So it's a very good theory,

95
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,705
but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.

96
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:47,320
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,178
people with high expectations always feel better.

98
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:55,110
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month

99
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,140
depends on how we interpret that event.

100
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,190
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown

101
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,184
studied students with high and low expectations.

102
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:09,368
And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,

103
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:12,278
they attribute that success to their own traits.

104
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,474
"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,

105
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:17,149
therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."

106
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,122
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,

107
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:23,295
but because the exam just happened to be unfair.

108
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,578
Next time they will do better.

109
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,655
People with low expectations do the opposite.

110
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:31,487
So when they failed it was because they were dumb,

111
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:32,987
and when they succeeded

112
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:36,304
it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.

113
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,705
Next time reality would catch up with them.

114
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,778
So they felt worse.

115
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:44,018
Number two: Regardless of the outcome,

116
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:48,065
the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.

117
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:51,241
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein

118
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,960
asked students in his university

119
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,322
to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.

120
00:05:57,322 --> 00:06:00,207
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay

121
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:02,195
to get a kiss from a celebrity

122
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,422
if the kiss was delivered immediately,

123
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:09,445
in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,

124
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,878
in one year, in 10 years?

125
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:15,008
He found that the students were willing to pay the most

126
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,007
not to get a kiss immediately,

127
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,987
but to get a kiss in three days.

128
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:24,234
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.

129
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,237
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;

130
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,658
no one wants an aging celebrity.

131
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:33,447
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.

132
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:35,750
So why is that?

133
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,174
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.

134
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:41,124
But if you get the kiss in three days,

135
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:45,278
well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.

136
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,147
The students wanted that time

137
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,528
to imagine where is it going to happen,

138
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:51,157
how is it going to happen.

139
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,368
Anticipation made them happy.

140
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:57,237
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.

141
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:59,320
It's a really curious fact,

142
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,737
because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,

143
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:05,641
so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,

144
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,362
but they don't.

145
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,237
It's not because they really, really like being in the office

146
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,204
and they can't stand strolling in the park

147
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:13,865
or having a lazy brunch.

148
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,001
We know that, because when you ask people

149
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,705
about their ultimate favorite day of the week,

150
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,525
surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,

151
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,445
then Friday, then Sunday.

152
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,314
People prefer Friday

153
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:30,278
because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,

154
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,195
all the plans that you have.

155
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,899
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to

156
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,153
is the work week.

157
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:42,030
So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,

158
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,951
more strolls in the park.

159
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:47,858
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.

160
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:50,822
In fact, without the optimism bias,

161
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,572
we would all be slightly depressed.

162
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,839
People with mild depression,

163
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,818
they don't have a bias when they look into the future.

164
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:03,040
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.

165
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,141
But individuals with severe depression,

166
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,970
they have a pessimistic bias.

167
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,433
So they tend to expect the future

168
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,910
to be worse than it ends up being.

169
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,153
So optimism changes subjective reality.

170
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:18,903
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.

171
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:22,145
But it also changes objective reality.

172
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:24,872
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

173
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,940
And that is the third reason

174
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,120
why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.

175
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,955
Controlled experiments have shown

176
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:34,872
that optimism is not only related to success,

177
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,679
it leads to success.

178
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,549
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.

179
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,024
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.

180
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,349
If we expect the future to be bright,

181
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,089
stress and anxiety are reduced.

182
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,309
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.

183
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,320
But the question that was really confusing to me was,

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,989
how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?

185
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,007
As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,

186
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,903
because according to all the theories out there,

187
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:14,091
when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.

188
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,643
But this is not what we find.

189
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:19,126
We asked people to come into our lab

190
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,936
in order to try and figure out what was going on.

191
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,483
We asked them to estimate their likelihood

192
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,987
of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.

193
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:31,362
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?

194
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,714
And then we told them the average likelihood

195
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,695
of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.

196
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:40,260
So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.

197
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,195
And then we asked them again,

198
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:46,070
"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"

199
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,318
What we wanted to know was

200
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,987
whether people will take the information that we gave them

201
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:53,118
to change their beliefs.

202
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:55,487
And indeed they did --

203
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,068
but mostly when the information we gave them

204
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,899
was better than what they expected.

205
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,260
So for example,

206
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,170
if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer

207
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,551
is about 50 percent,"

208
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:10,072
and we said, "Hey, good news.

209
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,653
The average likelihood is only 30 percent,"

210
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,699
the next time around they would say,

211
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,414
"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."

212
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:20,050
So they learned quickly and efficiently.

213
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,600
But if someone started off saying,

214
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,003
"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"

215
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,695
and we said, "Hey, bad news.

216
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,768
The average likelihood is about 30 percent,"

217
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,826
the next time around they would say,

218
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:36,945
"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."

219
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,635
(Laughter)

220
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:41,954
So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did --

221
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:44,290
but much, much less than when we gave them

222
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,763
positive information about the future.

223
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,797
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;

224
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,870
everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer

225
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,370
is about 30 percent

226
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,149
and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.

227
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,780
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.

228
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,928
What this means is that warning signs such as these

229
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:08,820
may only have limited impact.

230
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,979
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.

231
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,862
What I wanted to know was

232
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:17,722
what was going on inside the human brain

233
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:21,816
that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.

234
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,303
But at the same time,

235
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:25,281
when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,

236
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:29,397
we think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."

237
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,482
To try and figure that out,

238
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,955
I asked the participants in the experiment

239
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,116
to lie in a brain imaging scanner.

240
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:37,643
It looks like this.

241
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:40,674
And using a method called functional MRI,

242
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:44,280
we were able to identify regions in the brain

243
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,097
that were responding to positive information.

244
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:50,676
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.

245
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,464
So if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"

246
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,320
and we said, "Hey, good news.

247
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,610
Average likelihood is 30 percent,"

248
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,182
the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.

249
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:06,914
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist

250
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,735
or slightly pessimistic,

251
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,320
everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus

252
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,164
was functioning perfectly well,

253
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,070
whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.

254
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,714
On the other side of the brain,

255
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:22,500
the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.

256
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,226
And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.

257
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,241
The more optimistic you were,

258
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,578
the less likely this region was

259
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:33,560
to respond to unexpected negative information.

260
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,618
And if your brain is failing

261
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:39,843
at integrating bad news about the future,

262
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,466
you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.

263
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:49,435
So we wanted to know, could we change this?

264
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,878
Could we alter people's optimism bias

265
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,810
by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?

266
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,405
And there's a way for us to do that.

267
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,032
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.

268
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,987
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse

269
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:08,106
through the skull of the participant in our study

270
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:10,351
into their inferior frontal gyrus.

271
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,278
And by doing that,

272
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:15,182
he's interfering with the activity of this brain region

273
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:16,397
for about half an hour.

274
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,318
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.

275
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,311
(Laughter)

276
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:24,465
So let's see what happens.

277
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,562
First of all, I'm going to show you

278
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:29,266
the average amount of bias that we see.

279
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,089
So if I was to test all of you now,

280
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,883
this is the amount that you would learn

281
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:37,003
more from good news relative to bad news.

282
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:39,487
Now we interfere with the region

283
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:43,954
that we found to integrate negative information in this task,

284
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:47,518
and the optimism bias grew even larger.

285
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:52,988
We made people more biased in the way that they process information.

286
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:55,885
Then we interfered with the brain region

287
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,403
that we found to integrate good news in this task,

288
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:03,874
and the optimism bias disappeared.

289
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:05,882
We were quite amazed by these results

290
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,074
because we were able to eliminate

291
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:11,270
a deep-rooted bias in humans.

292
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,043
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,

293
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:21,145
would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?

294
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:26,189
If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?

295
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,789
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,

296
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:35,110
which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.

297
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,195
But there are, of course, pitfalls,

298
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:40,315
and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.

299
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,861
Take for example this email I recieved

300
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,555
from a firefighter here in California.

301
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:49,859
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters

302
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:54,001
often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'

303
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,303
even when all of the available information

304
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:58,558
was there to make safe decisions."

305
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:02,432
This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias

306
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:04,624
to try to explain to the firefighters

307
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,833
why they think the way they do,

308
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:13,959
to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.

309
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,078
So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,

310
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,716
to financial collapse, to faulty planning.

311
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:24,854
The British government, for example,

312
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:27,528
has acknowledged that the optimism bias

313
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:30,815
can make individuals more likely

314
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,841
to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.

315
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:39,095
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget

316
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,206
for the optimism bias.

317
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,393
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks

318
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,827
has done the same for his wedding budget.

319
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,889
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,

320
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,449
he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.

321
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,866
So what we would really like to do,

322
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:59,027
is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,

323
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:02,255
but at the same time remain hopeful,

324
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:05,099
benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.

325
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,903
And I believe there's a way for us to do that.

326
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:09,963
The key here really is knowledge.

327
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:13,274
We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.

328
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:17,115
These have to be identified by scientific investigation.

329
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:21,299
But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias

330
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,074
does not shatter the illusion.

331
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:24,622
It's like visual illusions,

332
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:28,112
in which understanding them does not make them go away.

333
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,349
And this is good because it means

334
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,822
we should be able to strike a balance,

335
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:35,249
to come up with plans and rules

336
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:38,032
to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,

337
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:41,184
but at the same time remain hopeful.

338
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:44,608
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.

339
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:48,134
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there

340
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,253
who just does not believe they can fly,

341
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,612
you certainly never will.

342
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,443
Because to make any kind of progress,

343
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,793
we need to be able to imagine a different reality,

344
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,524
and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.

345
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:04,058
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin

346
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,820
who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,

347
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,601
you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.

348
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,490
But if you're an optimistic penguin

349
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,286
who believes they can fly,

350
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:17,949
but then adjusts a parachute to your back

351
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,966
just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,

352
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:22,829
you will soar like an eagle,

353
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,878
even if you're just a penguin.

354
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,640
Thank you.

355
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,576
(Applause)
