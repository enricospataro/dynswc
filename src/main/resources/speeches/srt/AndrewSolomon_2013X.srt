1
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:19,634
"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,

2
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,036
and Mourners to and fro

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,863
kept treading -- treading --
till [it seemed]

4
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:27,206
that Sense was breaking through --

5
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:29,401
And when they all were seated,

6
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,399
a Service, like a Drum --

7
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:34,875
kept beating -- beating --
till I [thought]

8
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,665
my Mind was going numb --

9
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,790
And then I heard them lift a Box
and creak across my Soul

10
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:44,849
with those same Boots of Lead, again,

11
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:47,866
then Space -- began to toll,

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,997
As [all] the Heavens were a Bell,
and Being, [but] an Ear,

13
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,080
and I, and Silence, some strange Race,

14
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,684
wrecked, solitary, here --

15
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:01,466
[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,807
and I fell down and down --

17
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,482
and hit a World, at every plunge,

18
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:10,065
and Finished knowing -- then --"

19
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:14,832
We know depression through metaphors.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,185
Emily Dickinson was able
to convey it in language,

21
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,524
Goya in an image.

22
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:26,653
Half the purpose of art
is to describe such iconic states.

23
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,671
As for me, I had always
thought myself tough,

24
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,497
one of the people who could survive

25
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,844
if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.

26
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:39,099
In 1991, I had a series of losses.

27
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:40,994
My mother died,

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,120
a relationship I'd been in ended,

29
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,064
I moved back to the United States
from some years abroad,

30
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,802
and I got through all of those
experiences intact.

31
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:53,336
But in 1994, three years later,

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,102
I found myself losing interest
in almost everything.

33
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,755
I didn't want to do any of the things
I had previously wanted to do,

34
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,239
and I didn't know why.

35
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:08,368
The opposite of depression
is not happiness, but vitality.

36
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:10,391
And it was vitality

37
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:13,378
that seemed to seep away
from me in that moment.

38
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,728
Everything there was to do
seemed like too much work.

39
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,854
I would come home

40
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,206
and I would see the red light
flashing on my answering machine,

41
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,770
and instead of being thrilled
to hear from my friends,

42
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:26,983
I would think,

43
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,602
"What a lot of people that is
to have to call back."

44
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,750
Or I would decide I should have lunch,

45
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,511
and then I would think,
but I'd have to get the food out

46
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,297
and put it on a plate

47
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:41,185
and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,

48
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,543
and it felt to me
like the Stations of the Cross.

49
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:49,239
And one of the things that often gets lost
in discussions of depression

50
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,321
is that you know it's ridiculous.

51
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,564
You know it's ridiculous
while you're experiencing it.

52
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,477
You know that most people manage

53
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,791
to listen to their messages and eat lunch

54
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,721
and organize themselves to take a shower

55
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:01,963
and go out the front door

56
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:03,615
and that it's not a big deal,

57
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,781
and yet you are nonetheless in its grip

58
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:10,242
and you are unable to figure out
any way around it.

59
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,032
And so I began to feel myself doing less

60
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,342
and thinking less

61
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,681
and feeling less.

62
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,387
It was a kind of nullity.

63
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,864
And then the anxiety set in.

64
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:28,079
If you told me that I'd have to be
depressed for the next month,

65
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:31,342
I would say, "As long I know it'll be over
in November, I can do it."

66
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,612
But if you said to me,

67
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:35,949
"You have to have acute anxiety
for the next month,"

68
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,292
I would rather slit my wrist
than go through it.

69
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,874
It was the feeling all the time

70
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:42,102
like that feeling you have
if you're walking

71
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:45,647
and you slip or trip
and the ground is rushing up at you,

72
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,383
but instead of lasting half a second,
the way that does,

73
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,288
it lasted for six months.

74
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,241
It's a sensation
of being afraid all the time

75
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:56,250
but not even knowing
what it is that you're afraid of.

76
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:59,488
And it was at that point
that I began to think

77
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:03,272
that it was just too painful to be alive,

78
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,856
and that the only reason
not to kill oneself

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,575
was so as not to hurt other people.

80
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,996
And finally one day, I woke up

81
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,217
and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,

82
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:16,735
because I lay in bed completely frozen,

83
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,684
looking at the telephone, thinking,

84
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,247
"Something is wrong
and I should call for help,"

85
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,982
and I couldn't reach out my arm

86
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,248
and pick up the phone and dial.

87
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,672
And finally, after four full hours
of my lying and staring at it,

88
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:31,960
the phone rang,

89
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:34,363
and somehow I managed to pick it up,

90
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,315
and it was my father, and I said,

91
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,785
"I'm in serious trouble.
We need to do something."

92
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:46,039
The next day I started
with the medications and the therapy.

93
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:51,375
And I also started reckoning
with this terrible question:

94
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,503
If I'm not the tough person

95
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,027
who could have made it
through a concentration camp,

96
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,539
then who am I?

97
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,424
And if I have to take medication,

98
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:03,361
is that medication making me
more fully myself,

99
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,603
or is it making me someone else?

100
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:09,087
And how do I feel about it
if it's making me someone else?

101
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:12,825
I had two advantages
as I went into the fight.

102
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,076
The first is that I knew that,
objectively speaking,

103
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,697
I had a nice life,

104
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,582
and that if I could only get well,

105
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,806
there was something at the other end
that was worth living for.

106
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,647
And the other was
that I had access to good treatment.

107
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:29,612
But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,

108
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:32,147
and emerged and relapsed,

109
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:35,165
and emerged and relapsed,

110
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,129
and finally understood

111
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:41,074
I would have to be on medication
and in therapy forever.

112
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:42,756
And I thought,

113
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,566
"But is it a chemical problem
or a psychological problem?

114
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,523
And does it need a chemical cure
or a philosophical cure?"

115
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:51,674
And I couldn't figure out which it was.

116
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,798
And then I understood that actually,

117
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:57,809
we aren't advanced enough in either area
for it to explain things fully.

118
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,160
The chemical cure
and the psychological cure

119
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,858
both have a role to play,

120
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:06,856
and I also figured out
that depression was something

121
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,104
that was braided so deep into us

122
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:12,816
that there was no separating it
from our character and personality.

123
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,834
I want to say that the treatments we have
for depression are appalling.

124
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,461
They're not very effective.

125
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,548
They're extremely costly.

126
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:24,069
They come with innumerable side effects.

127
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,530
They're a disaster.

128
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:30,514
But I am so grateful that I live now
and not 50 years ago,

129
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:33,458
when there would have been
almost nothing to be done.

130
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,865
I hope that 50 years hence,

131
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,911
people will hear about my treatments

132
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,603
and be appalled that anyone endured
such primitive science.

133
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:45,947
Depression is the flaw in love.

134
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:50,378
If you were married
to someone and thought,

135
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:54,112
"Well, if my wife dies,
I'll find another one,"

136
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,385
it wouldn't be love as we know it.

137
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:01,751
There's no such thing as love
without the anticipation of loss,

138
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:07,331
and that specter of despair
can be the engine of intimacy.

139
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,855
There are three things
people tend to confuse:

140
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,968
depression, grief and sadness.

141
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:18,125
Grief is explicitly reactive.

142
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:21,030
If you have a loss
and you feel incredibly unhappy,

143
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:22,729
and then, six months later,

144
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:25,838
you are still deeply sad,
but you're functioning a little better,

145
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,647
it's probably grief,

146
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:31,406
and it will probably ultimately
resolve itself in some measure.

147
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,235
If you experience a catastrophic loss,

148
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,561
and you feel terrible,

149
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,374
and six months later
you can barely function at all,

150
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:40,912
then it's probably a depression
that was triggered

151
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,119
by the catastrophic circumstances.

152
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:46,638
The trajectory tells us a great deal.

153
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,376
People think of depression
as being just sadness.

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,571
It's much, much too much sadness,

155
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,346
much too much grief

156
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,479
at far too slight a cause.

157
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,075
As I set out to understand depression,

158
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,746
and to interview people
who had experienced it,

159
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,563
I found that there were people
who seemed, on the surface,

160
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,800
to have what sounded like
relatively mild depression

161
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,562
who were nonetheless
utterly disabled by it.

162
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,530
And there were other people
who had what sounded

163
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:18,616
as they described it
like terribly severe depression

164
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,380
who nonetheless had good lives

165
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:23,110
in the interstices
between their depressive episodes.

166
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:27,670
And I set out to find out
what it is that causes some people

167
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,923
to be more resilient than other people.

168
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:33,163
What are the mechanisms
that allow people to survive?

169
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,670
And I went out and I interviewed
person after person

170
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:38,670
who was suffering with depression.

171
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,885
One of the first people I interviewed

172
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,763
described depression
as a slower way of being dead,

173
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:48,121
and that was a good thing
for me to hear early on

174
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,252
because it reminded me
that that slow way of being dead

175
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:53,556
can lead to actual deadness,

176
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,537
that this is a serious business.

177
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:57,950
It's the leading disability worldwide,

178
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,056
and people die of it every day.

179
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,723
One of the people I talked to
when I was trying to understand this

180
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:08,608
was a beloved friend
who I had known for many years,

181
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:13,085
and who had had a psychotic episode
in her freshman year of college,

182
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,911
and then plummeted
into a horrific depression.

183
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,574
She had bipolar illness,

184
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,085
or manic depression, as it was then known.

185
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:23,894
And then she did very well
for many years on lithium,

186
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:27,067
and then eventually,
she was taken off her lithium

187
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,902
to see how she would do without it,

188
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,877
and she had another psychosis,

189
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:35,261
and then plunged into the worst depression
that I had ever seen

190
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:38,102
in which she sat
in her parents' apartment,

191
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:41,398
more or less catatonic,
essentially without moving,

192
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,335
day after day after day.

193
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:47,247
And when I interviewed her
about that experience some years later --

194
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:50,372
she's a poet and psychotherapist
named Maggie Robbins --

195
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:53,442
when I interviewed her, she said,

196
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:56,985
"I was singing 'Where Have
All The Flowers Gone,'

197
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,906
over and over, to occupy my mind.

198
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,171
I was singing to blot out
the things my mind was saying,

199
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:07,955
which were, 'You are nothing.
You are nobody.

200
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,910
You don't even deserve to live.'

201
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,917
And that was
when I really started thinking

202
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,295
about killing myself."

203
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,923
You don't think in depression
that you've put on a gray veil

204
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:22,311
and are seeing the world
through the haze of a bad mood.

205
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:25,811
You think that the veil
has been taken away,

206
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,439
the veil of happiness,

207
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,400
and that now you're seeing truly.

208
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,827
It's easier to help
schizophrenics who perceive

209
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:36,825
that there's something foreign
inside of them that needs to be exorcised,

210
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,175
but it's difficult with depressives,

211
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,001
because we believe
we are seeing the truth.

212
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,405
But the truth lies.

213
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,781
I became obsessed with that sentence:

214
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,937
"But the truth lies."

215
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,695
And I discovered,
as I talked to depressive people,

216
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,291
that they have
many delusional perceptions.

217
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,373
People will say, "No one loves me."

218
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:58,609
And you say, "I love you,

219
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:01,131
your wife loves you,
your mother loves you."

220
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,516
You can answer that one pretty readily,
at least for most people.

221
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:07,110
But people who are depressed
will also say,

222
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:11,181
"No matter what we do,
we're all just going to die in the end."

223
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,434
Or they'll say,
"There can be no true communion

224
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,820
between two human beings.

225
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:17,228
Each of us is trapped in his own body."

226
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,245
To which you have to say,

227
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,748
"That's true,

228
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:24,280
but I think we should focus right now
on what to have for breakfast."

229
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:26,465
(Laughter)

230
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,134
A lot of the time,

231
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:31,132
what they are expressing
is not illness, but insight,

232
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,687
and one comes to think
what's really extraordinary

233
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,843
is that most of us know
about those existential questions

234
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,911
and they don't distract us very much.

235
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:41,070
There was a study I particularly liked

236
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:44,837
in which a group of depressed
and a group of non-depressed people

237
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,585
were asked to play a video
game for an hour,

238
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,229
and at the end of the hour,

239
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:52,863
they were asked how many little monsters
they thought they had killed.

240
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:56,872
The depressive group was usually accurate
to within about 10 percent,

241
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,467
and the non-depressed people

242
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:02,945
guessed between 15 and 20 times
as many little monsters --

243
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,120
(Laughter)

244
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,896
as they had actually killed.

245
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,981
A lot of people said, when I chose
to write about my depression,

246
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:14,470
that it must be very difficult
to be out of that closet,

247
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:15,803
to have people know.

248
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,096
They said, "Do people
talk to you differently?"

249
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,199
I said, "Yes, people
talk to me differently.

250
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,985
They talk to me differently insofar

251
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,676
as they start telling me
about their experience,

252
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,511
or their sister's experience,

253
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,176
or their friend's experience.

254
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,747
Things are different because now I know

255
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:34,876
that depression is the family secret
that everyone has.

256
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,161
I went a few years ago to a conference,

257
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,616
and on Friday of the three-day conference,

258
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,645
one of the participants
took me aside, and she said,

259
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:50,918
"I suffer from depression
and I'm a little embarrassed about it,

260
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,784
but I've been taking this medication,

261
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:55,922
and I just wanted to ask you
what you think?"

262
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,566
And so I did my best to give her
such advice as I could.

263
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,077
And then she said, "You know,
my husband would never understand this.

264
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,369
He's really the kind of guy to whom
this wouldn't make any sense,

265
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,517
so, you know, it's just between us."

266
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,093
And I said, "Yes, that's fine."

267
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:12,412
On Sunday of the same conference,

268
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:14,312
her husband took me aside,

269
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,650
(Laughter)

270
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,435
and he said, "My wife wouldn't think

271
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,770
that I was really much
of a guy if she knew this,

272
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:23,552
but I've been dealing with this depression
and I'm taking some medication,

273
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:26,001
and I wondered what you think?"

274
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,315
They were hiding the same medication

275
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,714
in two different places
in the same bedroom.

276
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:32,936
(Laughter)

277
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,898
And I said that I thought
communication within the marriage

278
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,970
might be triggering
some of their problems.

279
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:40,486
(Laughter)

280
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,976
But I was also struck

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,518
by the burdensome nature
of such mutual secrecy.

282
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,822
Depression is so exhausting.

283
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,792
It takes up so much
of your time and energy,

284
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:54,347
and silence about it,

285
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,628
it really does make the depression worse.

286
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:58,305
And then I began thinking

287
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,652
about all the ways
people make themselves better.

288
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:03,137
I'd started off as a medical conservative.

289
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,795
I thought there were a few
kinds of therapy that worked,

290
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,264
it was clear what they were --

291
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,788
there was medication,

292
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,479
there were certain psychotherapies,

293
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,924
there was possibly
electroconvulsive treatment,

294
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:15,537
and that everything else was nonsense.

295
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,489
But then I discovered something.

296
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,146
If you have brain cancer,

297
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,358
and you say that standing on your head
for 20 minutes every morning

298
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,535
makes you feel better,

299
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,537
it may make you feel better,
but you still have brain cancer,

300
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,634
and you'll still probably die from it.

301
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,493
But if you say that you have depression,

302
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,857
and standing on your head
for 20 minutes every day

303
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,077
makes you feel better, then it's worked,

304
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,542
because depression
is an illness of how you feel,

305
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:39,896
and if you feel better,

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,479
then you are effectively
not depressed anymore.

307
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,019
So I became much more tolerant

308
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,431
of the vast world
of alternative treatments.

309
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,068
And I get letters,
I get hundreds of letters

310
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,902
from people writing to tell me
about what's worked for them.

311
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,491
Someone was asking me
backstage today about meditation.

312
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:00,187
My favorite of the letters that I got
was the one that came from a woman

313
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:03,132
who wrote and said
that she had tried therapy, medication,

314
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,986
she had tried pretty much everything,

315
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,916
and she had found a solution
and hoped I would tell the world,

316
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,512
and that was making
little things from yarn.

317
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,429
(Laughter)

318
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:15,989
She sent me some of them.

319
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,043
(Laughter)

320
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,932
And I'm not wearing them right now.

321
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:21,106
(Laughter)

322
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:24,156
I suggested to her
that she also should look up

323
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,586
obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.

324
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,489
And yet, when I went to look
at alternative treatments,

325
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,941
I also gained perspective
on other treatments.

326
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:37,143
I went through
a tribal exorcism in Senegal

327
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,156
that involved a great deal of ram's blood

328
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,218
and that I'm not going
to detail right now,

329
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,242
but a few years afterwards
I was in Rwanda,

330
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,163
working on a different project,

331
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,772
and I happened to describe
my experience to someone,

332
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:48,955
and he said,

333
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,437
"Well, that's West Africa,
and we're in East Africa,

334
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:53,718
and our rituals are
in some ways very different,

335
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,043
but we do have some rituals

336
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,867
that have something in common
with what you're describing."

337
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,058
And he said,

338
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:02,293
"But we've had a lot of trouble
with Western mental health workers,

339
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,935
especially the ones who came
right after the genocide."

340
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,009
I said, "What kind
of trouble did you have?"

341
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,785
And he said, "Well,
they would do this bizarre thing.

342
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,857
They didn't take people out
in the sunshine

343
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,370
where you begin to feel better.

344
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:17,546
They didn't include drumming
or music to get people's blood going.

345
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,476
They didn't involve the whole community.

346
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,736
They didn't externalize
the depression as an invasive spirit.

347
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,773
Instead what they did was they took people
one at a time into dingy little rooms

348
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,178
and had them talk for an hour

349
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:31,346
about bad things
that had happened to them."

350
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,413
(Laughter)

351
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,806
(Applause)

352
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,259
He said, "We had to ask them
to leave the country."

353
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,225
(Laughter)

354
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,827
Now at the other end
of alternative treatments,

355
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,946
let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.

356
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,672
Frank Russakoff had the worst depression
perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.

357
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,665
He was constantly depressed.

358
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,134
He was, when I met him,

359
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:59,964
at a point at which every month,
he would have electroshock treatment.

360
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:02,539
Then he would feel
sort of disoriented for a week.

361
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,342
Then he would feel okay for a week.

362
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,460
Then he would have a week
of going downhill.

363
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,074
And then he would have another
electroshock treatment.

364
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,671
And he said to me when I met him,

365
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:13,060
"It's unbearable to go
through my weeks this way.

366
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,531
I can't go on this way,

367
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,665
and I've figured out
how I'm going to end it

368
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,022
if I don't get better."

369
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:22,148
"But," he said to me,
"I heard about a protocol at Mass General

370
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:25,394
for a procedure called a cingulotomy,
which is a brain surgery,

371
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,687
and I think I'm going to give that a try."

372
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:31,004
And I remember being amazed
at that point to think that someone

373
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:34,025
who clearly had so many bad experiences

374
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,185
with so many different treatments

375
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,249
still had buried in him,
somewhere, enough optimism

376
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,058
to reach out for one more.

377
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,777
And he had the cingulotomy,
and it was incredibly successful.

378
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,413
He's now a friend of mine.

379
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:50,762
He has a lovely wife
and two beautiful children.

380
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:53,711
He wrote me a letter
the Christmas after the surgery,

381
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:54,900
and he said,

382
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,527
"My father sent me two presents this year,

383
00:17:57,551 --> 00:18:00,078
First, a motorized CD rack
from The Sharper Image

384
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,500
that I didn't really need,

385
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,761
but I knew he was giving it
to me to celebrate

386
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:07,034
the fact that I'm living on my own
and have a job I seem to love.

387
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,696
And the other present
was a photo of my grandmother,

388
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,196
who committed suicide.

389
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,680
As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,

390
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,561
and my mother came over and said,

391
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:20,577
'Are you crying because
of the relatives you never knew?'

392
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:24,530
And I said, 'She had
the same disease I have.'

393
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,674
I'm crying now as I write to you.

394
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:30,985
It's not that I'm so sad,
but I get overwhelmed,

395
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,206
I think, because I could
have killed myself,

396
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,658
but my parents kept me going,
and so did the doctors,

397
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,512
and I had the surgery.

398
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:40,618
I'm alive and grateful.

399
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:45,952
We live in the right time,
even if it doesn't always feel like it."

400
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,595
I was struck by the fact that depression

401
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,625
is broadly perceived to be
a modern, Western, middle-class thing,

402
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,780
and I went to look at how it operated
in a variety of other contexts,

403
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,995
and one of the things
I was most interested in

404
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,934
was depression among the indigent.

405
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,506
And so I went out to try to look

406
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,283
at what was being done
for poor people with depression.

407
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:09,434
And what I discovered is that poor people

408
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,986
are mostly not being
treated for depression.

409
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,684
Depression is the result
of a genetic vulnerability,

410
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,058
which is presumably
evenly distributed in the population,

411
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,795
and triggering circumstances,

412
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:23,573
which are likely to be more severe
for people who are impoverished.

413
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:27,100
And yet it turns out that if you have
a really lovely life

414
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,706
but feel miserable all the time,

415
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,516
you think, "Why do I feel like this?

416
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,809
I must have depression."

417
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,969
And you set out to find treatment for it.

418
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,925
But if you have a perfectly awful life,

419
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:37,692
and you feel miserable all the time,

420
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:40,726
the way you feel
is commensurate with your life,

421
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,605
and it doesn't occur to you to think,

422
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,166
"Maybe this is treatable."

423
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,392
And so we have an epidemic in this country

424
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,074
of depression among impoverished people

425
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,670
that's not being picked up
and that's not being treated

426
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,642
and that's not being addressed,

427
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,737
and it's a tragedy of a grand order.

428
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,639
And so I found an academic

429
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,888
who was doing a research project
in slums outside of D.C.,

430
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:05,055
where she picked up women
who had come in for other health problems

431
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,834
and diagnosed them with depression,

432
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:09,930
and then provided six months
of the experimental protocol.

433
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:12,259
One of them, Lolly, came in,

434
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,556
and this is what she said
the day she came in.

435
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,454
She said, and she was a woman,
by the way, who had seven children.

436
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:22,263
She said, "I used to have a job
but I had to give it up

437
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,502
because I couldn't go out of the house.

438
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,894
I have nothing to say to my children.

439
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,749
In the morning,
I can't wait for them to leave,

440
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:32,975
and then I climb in bed
and pull the covers over my head,

441
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,874
and three o'clock when they come home,

442
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:36,340
it just comes so fast."

443
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:38,658
She said, "I've been taking
a lot of Tylenol,

444
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,185
anything I can take
so that I can sleep more.

445
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:45,206
My husband has been telling me
I'm stupid, I'm ugly.

446
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,984
I wish I could stop the pain."

447
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,351
Well, she was brought
into this experimental protocol,

448
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,566
and when I interviewed her
six months later,

449
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,815
she had taken a job working in childcare

450
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,889
for the U.S. Navy,
she had left the abusive husband,

451
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,936
and she said to me,

452
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,215
"My kids are so much happier now."

453
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,921
She said, "There's one room
in my new place for the boys

454
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,832
and one room for the girls,

455
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,195
but at night, they're just
all up on my bed,

456
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,807
and we're doing homework
all together and everything.

457
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:17,505
One of them wants to be a preacher,

458
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,422
one of them wants to be a firefighter,

459
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,146
and one of the girls says
she's going to be a lawyer.

460
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,374
They don't cry like they used to,

461
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,208
and they don't fight like they did.

462
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:29,789
That's all I need now, is my kids.

463
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:32,591
Things keep on changing,

464
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:36,991
the way I dress,
the way I feel, the way I act.

465
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,530
I can go outside not being afraid anymore,

466
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:45,042
and I don't think
those bad feelings are coming back,

467
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,002
and if it weren't
for Dr. Miranda and that,

468
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:51,548
I would still be at home
with the covers pulled over my head,

469
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,425
if I were still alive at all.

470
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,423
I asked the Lord to send me an angel,

471
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,224
and He heard my prayers."

472
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:05,108
I was really moved by these experiences,

473
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:07,647
and I decided that I wanted
to write about them

474
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:10,488
not only in a book I was working on,
but also in an article,

475
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,091
and I got a commission
from The New York Times Magazine

476
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,234
to write about depression
among the indigent.

477
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:16,495
And I turned in my story,

478
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,979
and my editor called me and said,
"We really can't publish this."

479
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,647
And I said, "Why not?"

480
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:23,742
And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.

481
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:27,429
These people who are sort of
at the very bottom rung of society

482
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:29,468
and then they get
a few months of treatment

483
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:31,865
and they're virtually ready
to run Morgan Stanley?

484
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:33,405
It's just too implausible."

485
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,414
She said, "I've never even heard
of anything like it."

486
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,891
And I said, "The fact
that you've never heard of it

487
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:41,018
is an indication that it is news."

488
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,750
(Laughter)

489
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:49,113
(Applause)

490
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:51,254
"And you are a news magazine."

491
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,830
So after a certain amount of negotiation,
they agreed to it.

492
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:58,740
But I think a lot of what they said
was connected in some strange way

493
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:02,345
to this distaste that people still have
for the idea of treatment,

494
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,227
the notion that somehow if we went out

495
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,074
and treated a lot of people
in indigent communities,

496
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:08,954
that would be exploitative,

497
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:10,676
because we would be changing them.

498
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,507
There is this false moral imperative
that seems to be all around us,

499
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,639
that treatment of depression,

500
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,938
the medications and so on,
are an artifice,

501
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,285
and that it's not natural.

502
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,252
And I think that's very misguided.

503
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:27,609
It would be natural
for people's teeth to fall out,

504
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:30,821
but there is nobody militating
against toothpaste,

505
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,315
at least not in my circles.

506
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:34,979
People then say,

507
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:38,264
"But isn't depression part of what people
are supposed to experience?

508
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:40,020
Didn't we evolve to have depression?

509
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,795
Isn't it part of your personality?"

510
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,258
To which I would say, mood is adaptive.

511
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:47,359
Being able to have sadness and fear

512
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:49,289
and joy and pleasure

513
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:53,068
and all of the other moods that we have,
that's incredibly valuable.

514
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,006
And major depression

515
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,392
is something that happens
when that system gets broken.

516
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,020
It's maladaptive.

517
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,659
People will come to me and say,

518
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:04,485
"I think, though, if I just
stick it out for another year,

519
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,362
I think I can just get through this."

520
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:08,910
And I always say to them,
"You may get through it,

521
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:11,124
but you'll never be 37 again.

522
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:15,262
Life is short, and that's a whole year
you're talking about giving up.

523
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,953
Think it through."

524
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:20,162
It's a strange poverty
of the English language,

525
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:22,270
and indeed of many other languages,

526
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,664
that we use this same word, depression,

527
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:28,402
to describe how a kid feels
when it rains on his birthday,

528
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:32,785
and to describe how somebody feels
the minute before they commit suicide.

529
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:36,321
People say to me, "Well, is it
continuous with normal sadness?"

530
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,452
And I say, in a way it's continuous
with normal sadness.

531
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,650
There is a certain amount of continuity,

532
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:43,611
but it's the same way there's continuity

533
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:45,841
between having an iron fence
outside your house

534
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,285
that gets a little rust spot

535
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,907
that you have to sand off
and do a little repainting,

536
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,759
and what happens if you leave
the house for 100 years

537
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,582
and it rusts through
until it's only a pile of orange dust.

538
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:58,755
And it's that orange dust spot,

539
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,544
that orange dust problem,

540
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,154
that's the one
we're setting out to address.

541
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,074
So now people say,

542
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:08,777
"You take these happy pills,
and do you feel happy?"

543
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:09,991
And I don't.

544
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:13,382
But I don't feel sad
about having to eat lunch,

545
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:16,247
and I don't feel sad
about my answering machine,

546
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:18,469
and I don't feel sad
about taking a shower.

547
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,747
I feel more, in fact, I think,

548
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,177
because I can feel
sadness without nullity.

549
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:28,730
I feel sad about professional
disappointments,

550
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:31,038
about damaged relationships,

551
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,579
about global warming.

552
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:35,635
Those are the things
that I feel sad about now.

553
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,369
And I said to myself, well,
what is the conclusion?

554
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,930
How did those people who have better lives

555
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:43,484
even with bigger depression
manage to get through?

556
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:45,935
What is the mechanism of resilience?

557
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:48,365
And what I came up with over time

558
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:51,215
was that the people
who deny their experience,

559
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,255
and say, "I was depressed a long time ago,

560
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,050
I never want to think about it again,

561
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:56,368
I'm not going to look at it

562
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:58,415
and I'm just going
to get on with my life,"

563
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:03,037
ironically, those are the people
who are most enslaved by what they have.

564
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,259
Shutting out the depression
strengthens it.

565
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,290
While you hide from it, it grows.

566
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:11,543
And the people who do better

567
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:16,120
are the ones who are able to tolerate
the fact that they have this condition.

568
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:20,016
Those who can tolerate their depression
are the ones who achieve resilience.

569
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:21,948
So Frank Russakoff said to me,

570
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:25,694
"If I had a do-over,
I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,

571
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:29,186
but in a strange way,
I'm grateful for what I've experienced.

572
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,534
I'm glad to have been
in the hospital 40 times.

573
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,454
It taught me so much about love,

574
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,399
and my relationship
with my parents and my doctors

575
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:41,969
has been so precious to me,
and will be always."

576
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:44,494
And Maggie Robbins said,

577
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:47,483
"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,

578
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:50,497
and I would just talk and talk and talk,

579
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:54,554
and the people I was dealing with
weren't very responsive, and I thought,

580
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:57,074
'That's not very friendly
or helpful of them.'"

581
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,338
(Laughter)

582
00:26:58,362 --> 00:26:59,980
"And then I realized,

583
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:02,147
I realized that
they weren't going to do more

584
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:04,654
than make those first
few minutes of small talk.

585
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:06,717
It was simply going to be an occasion

586
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:09,690
where I didn't have AIDS
and I wasn't dying,

587
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:12,592
but could tolerate the fact that they did

588
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:13,831
and they were.

589
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:17,466
Our needs are our greatest assets.

590
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:22,187
It turns out I've learned to give
all the things I need."

591
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,841
Valuing one's depression
does not prevent a relapse,

592
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:30,502
but it may make the prospect of relapse

593
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:34,039
and even relapse itself
easier to tolerate.

594
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:38,482
The question is not so much
of finding great meaning

595
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:41,077
and deciding your depression
has been very meaningful.

596
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:45,092
It's of seeking that meaning
and thinking, when it comes again,

597
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:48,433
"This will be hellish,
but I will learn something from it."

598
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,547
I have learned in my own depression

599
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,769
how big an emotion can be,

600
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:56,853
how it can be more real than facts,

601
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:59,606
and I have found that that experience

602
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,498
has allowed me to experience
positive emotion

603
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,421
in a more intense and more focused way.

604
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:09,625
The opposite of depression
is not happiness,

605
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,959
but vitality,

606
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,938
and these days, my life is vital,

607
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:16,254
even on the days when I'm sad.

608
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:19,758
I felt that funeral in my brain,

609
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:24,322
and I sat next to the colossus
at the edge of the world,

610
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:28,233
and I have discovered
something inside of myself

611
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:30,321
that I would have to call a soul

612
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:33,858
that I had never formulated
until that day 20 years ago

613
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:37,183
when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.

614
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:42,474
I think that while I hated being depressed

615
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:45,000
and would hate to be depressed again,

616
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:47,087
I've found a way to love my depression.

617
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:51,897
I love it because it has forced me
to find and cling to joy.

618
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:56,090
I love it because each day I decide,

619
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:57,503
sometimes gamely,

620
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,072
and sometimes against the moment's reason,

621
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,235
to cleave to the reasons for living.

622
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,475
And that, I think,
is a highly privileged rapture.

623
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,152
Thank you.

624
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:12,177
(Applause)

625
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,352
Thank you.

626
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,748
(Applause)
