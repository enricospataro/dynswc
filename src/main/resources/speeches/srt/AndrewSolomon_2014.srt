1
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:16,012
As a student of adversity,

2
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:17,520
I've been struck over the years

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,512
by how some people

4
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:20,916
with major challenges

5
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,968
seem to draw strength from them,

6
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,858
and I've heard the popular wisdom

7
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,187
that that has to do with finding meaning.

8
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:29,842
And for a long time,

9
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,351
I thought the meaning was out there,

10
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,364
some great truth waiting to be found.

11
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:37,923
But over time, I've come to feel

12
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:39,947
that the truth is irrelevant.

13
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,536
We call it finding meaning,

14
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:46,657
but we might better call it forging meaning.

15
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,733
My last book was about how families

16
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,657
manage to deal with various kinds of challenging

17
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,732
or unusual offspring,

18
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,916
and one of the mothers I interviewed,

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,095
who had two children with
multiple severe disabilities,

20
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,635
said to me, "People always give us

21
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,489
these little sayings like,

22
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,317
'God doesn't give you any
more than you can handle,'

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,828
but children like ours

24
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:12,930
are not preordained as a gift.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,866
They're a gift because that's what we have chosen."

26
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:22,590
We make those choices all our lives.

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,857
When I was in second grade,

28
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:27,616
Bobby Finkel had a birthday party

29
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:32,141
and invited everyone in our class but me.

30
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,357
My mother assumed there
had been some sort of error,

31
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,254
and she called Mrs. Finkel,

32
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:38,593
who said that Bobby didn't like me

33
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:41,740
and didn't want me at his party.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,667
And that day, my mom took me to the zoo

35
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,687
and out for a hot fudge sundae.

36
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,545
When I was in seventh grade,

37
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:51,870
one of the kids on my school bus

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,803
nicknamed me "Percy"

39
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:56,496
as a shorthand for my demeanor,

40
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,595
and sometimes, he and his cohort

41
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,669
would chant that provocation

42
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,538
the entire school bus ride,

43
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:07,355
45 minutes up, 45 minutes back,

44
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:11,888
"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"

45
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,868
When I was in eighth grade,

46
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,515
our science teacher told us

47
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,164
that all male homosexuals

48
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,392
develop fecal incontinence

49
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:24,799
because of the trauma to their anal sphincter.

50
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,588
And I graduated high school

51
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:29,409
without ever going to the cafeteria,

52
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,128
where I would have sat with the girls

53
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:33,367
and been laughed at for doing so,

54
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,055
or sat with the boys

55
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,690
and been laughed at for being a boy

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,505
who should be sitting with the girls.

57
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,378
I survived that childhood through a mix

58
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,917
of avoidance and endurance.

59
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,035
What I didn't know then,

60
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,656
and do know now,

61
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:51,043
is that avoidance and endurance

62
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:55,730
can be the entryway to forging meaning.

63
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,004
After you've forged meaning,

64
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,218
you need to incorporate that meaning

65
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,332
into a new identity.

66
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,700
You need to take the traumas and make them part

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
of who you've come to be,

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,665
and you need to fold the worst events of your life

69
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,858
into a narrative of triumph,

70
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,742
evincing a better self

71
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:18,291
in response to things that hurt.

72
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,036
One of the other mothers I interviewed

73
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:22,188
when I was working on my book

74
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,690
had been raped as an adolescent,

75
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,673
and had a child following that rape,

76
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,620
which had thrown away her career plans

77
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,670
and damaged all of her emotional relationships.

78
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,880
But when I met her, she was 50,

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,096
and I said to her,

80
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:41,752
"Do you often think about the man who raped you?"

81
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:46,211
And she said, "I used to think about him with anger,

82
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,443
but now only with pity."

83
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:50,704
And I thought she meant pity because he was

84
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:54,396
so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing.

85
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:55,955
And I said, "Pity?"

86
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:57,530
And she said, "Yes,

87
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,158
because he has a beautiful daughter

88
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,393
and two beautiful grandchildren

89
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:06,171
and he doesn't know that, and I do.

90
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:12,091
So as it turns out, I'm the lucky one."

91
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:15,403
Some of our struggles are things we're born to:

92
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:20,908
our gender, our sexuality, our race, our disability.

93
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:23,141
And some are things that happen to us:

94
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,997
being a political prisoner, being a rape victim,

95
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:29,190
being a Katrina survivor.

96
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,475
Identity involves entering a community

97
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:34,856
to draw strength from that community,

98
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,261
and to give strength there too.

99
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:41,746
It involves substituting "and" for "but" --

100
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:46,095
not "I am here but I have cancer,"

101
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:51,384
but rather, "I have cancer and I am here."

102
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,188
When we're ashamed,

103
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:55,165
we can't tell our stories,

104
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:59,994
and stories are the foundation of identity.

105
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:03,761
Forge meaning, build identity,

106
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,500
forge meaning and build identity.

107
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,801
That became my mantra.

108
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:13,521
Forging meaning is about changing yourself.

109
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,967
Building identity is about changing the world.

110
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,607
All of us with stigmatized identities

111
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,550
face this question daily:

112
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,902
how much to accommodate society

113
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,093
by constraining ourselves,

114
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,919
and how much to break the limits

115
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,686
of what constitutes a valid life?

116
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:35,200
Forging meaning and building identity

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,967
does not make what was wrong right.

118
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:42,641
It only makes what was wrong precious.

119
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,844
In January of this year,

120
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,173
I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners,

121
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,670
and I was surprised to find them less bitter

122
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,466
than I'd anticipated.

123
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,326
Most of them had knowingly committed

124
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,950
the offenses that landed them in prison,

125
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,234
and they had walked in with their heads held high,

126
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,584
and they walked out with their heads

127
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,376
still held high, many years later.

128
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:10,582
Dr. Ma Thida, a leading human rights activist

129
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:12,345
who had nearly died in prison

130
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:15,232
and had spent many years in solitary confinement,

131
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:18,680
told me she was grateful to her jailers

132
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,615
for the time she had had to think,

133
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,386
for the wisdom she had gained,

134
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:27,430
for the chance to hone her meditation skills.

135
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,997
She had sought meaning

136
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:32,880
and made her travail into a crucial identity.

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,707
But if the people I met

138
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,890
were less bitter than I'd anticipated

139
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,490
about being in prison,

140
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,354
they were also less thrilled than I'd expected

141
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:43,337
about the reform process going on

142
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,987
in their country.

143
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,657
Ma Thida said,

144
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,302
"We Burmese are noted

145
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:51,774
for our tremendous grace under pressure,

146
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:56,107
but we also have grievance under glamour,"

147
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,513
she said, "and the fact that there have been

148
00:06:58,513 --> 00:06:59,848
these shifts and changes

149
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,162
doesn't erase the continuing problems

150
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:03,654
in our society

151
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:06,131
that we learned to see so well

152
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:08,065
while we were in prison."

153
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:10,224
And I understood her to be saying

154
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:13,680
that concessions confer only a little humanity,

155
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,938
where full humanity is due,

156
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,186
that crumbs are not the same

157
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:20,222
as a place at the table,

158
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,818
which is to say you can forge meaning

159
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:29,258
and build identity and still be mad as hell.

160
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,922
I've never been raped,

161
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,980
and I've never been in anything
remotely approaching

162
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,707
a Burmese prison,

163
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,591
but as a gay American,

164
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,625
I've experienced prejudice and even hatred,

165
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:46,167
and I've forged meaning and I've built identity,

166
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,516
which is a move I learned from people

167
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:51,038
who had experienced far worse privation

168
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,602
than I've ever known.

169
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:55,269
In my own adolescence,

170
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,761
I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight.

171
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,710
I enrolled myself in something called

172
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,871
sexual surrogacy therapy,

173
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,688
in which people I was encouraged to call doctors

174
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:10,527
prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises

175
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:14,279
with women I was encouraged to call surrogates,

176
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,770
who were not exactly prostitutes

177
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,695
but who were also not exactly anything else.

178
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:24,178
(Laughter)

179
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,895
My particular favorite

180
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:28,200
was a blonde woman from the Deep South

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,061
who eventually admitted to me

182
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:32,403
that she was really a necrophiliac

183
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:35,205
and had taken this job after she got in trouble

184
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,150
down at the morgue.

185
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,306
(Laughter)

186
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,154
These experiences eventually allowed me to have

187
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,943
some happy physical relationships with women,

188
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,461
for which I'm grateful,

189
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:53,185
but I was at war with myself,

190
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:58,019
and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche.

191
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,244
We don't seek the painful experiences

192
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,920
that hew our identities,

193
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,730
but we seek our identities

194
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,163
in the wake of painful experiences.

195
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,049
We cannot bear a pointless torment,

196
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,549
but we can endure great pain

197
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:17,724
if we believe that it's purposeful.

198
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,980
Ease makes less of an impression on us

199
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,463
than struggle.

200
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,920
We could have been ourselves without our delights,

201
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,196
but not without the misfortunes

202
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:29,027
that drive our search for meaning.

203
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,810
"Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities,"

204
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,094
St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,

205
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:39,610
"for when I am weak, then I am strong."

206
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,555
In 1988, I went to Moscow

207
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:45,670
to interview artists of the Soviet underground,

208
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,543
and I expected their work to be

209
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,997
dissident and political.

210
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,055
But the radicalism in their work actually lay

211
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,980
in reinserting humanity into a society

212
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,163
that was annihilating humanity itself,

213
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,951
as, in some senses, Russian society

214
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:02,818
is now doing again.

215
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,405
One of the artists I met said to me,

216
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:09,816
"We were in training to be not artists but angels."

217
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,971
In 1991, I went back to see the artists

218
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:14,449
I'd been writing about,

219
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,598
and I was with them during the putsch

220
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:18,360
that ended the Soviet Union,

221
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,649
and they were among the chief organizers

222
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,675
of the resistance to that putsch.

223
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:27,094
And on the third day of the putsch,

224
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,133
one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya.

225
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,415
And we went there,

226
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:34,674
and we arranged ourselves in
front of one of the barricades,

227
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:36,432
and a little while later,

228
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:38,693
a column of tanks rolled up,

229
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,730
and the soldier on the front tank said,

230
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,934
"We have unconditional orders

231
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,540
to destroy this barricade.

232
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,195
If you get out of the way,

233
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,760
we don't need to hurt you,

234
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,638
but if you won't move, we'll have no choice

235
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,351
but to run you down."

236
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,203
And the artists I was with said,

237
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:54,610
"Give us just a minute.

238
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,958
Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here."

239
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,014
And the soldier folded his arms,

240
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:05,614
and the artist launched into a
Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy

241
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,472
such as those of us who live

242
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,393
in a Jeffersonian democracy

243
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:12,688
would be hard-pressed to present.

244
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,444
And they went on and on,

245
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,447
and the soldier watched,

246
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,176
and then he sat there for a full minute

247
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,680
after they were finished

248
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,465
and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain,

249
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:26,142
and said, "What you have said is true,

250
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:29,758
and we must bow to the will of the people.

251
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:32,229
If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around,

252
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:34,683
we'll go back the way we came."

253
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,829
And that's what they did.

254
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,047
Sometimes, forging meaning

255
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,667
can give you the vocabulary you need

256
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,925
to fight for your ultimate freedom.

257
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:48,080
Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion

258
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,634
that oppression breeds the power to oppose it,

259
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:54,060
and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone

260
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,594
of identity.

261
00:11:55,594 --> 00:12:00,279
It took identity to rescue me from sadness.

262
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,395
The gay rights movement posits a world

263
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:05,246
in which my aberrances are a victory.

264
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,874
Identity politics always works on two fronts:

265
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,929
to give pride to people who have a given condition

266
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,386
or characteristic,

267
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,062
and to cause the outside world

268
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:18,590
to treat such people more gently and more kindly.

269
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,108
Those are two totally separate enterprises,

270
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,933
but progress in each sphere

271
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:26,292
reverberates in the other.

272
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:30,041
Identity politics can be narcissistic.

273
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,369
People extol a difference only because it's theirs.

274
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,768
People narrow the world and function

275
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,819
in discrete groups without empathy for one another.

276
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:41,304
But properly understood

277
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,225
and wisely practiced,

278
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,216
identity politics should expand

279
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,743
our idea of what it is to be human.

280
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,461
Identity itself

281
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,010
should be not a smug label

282
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,094
or a gold medal

283
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:56,567
but a revolution.

284
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,133
I would have had an easier life if I were straight,

285
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,930
but I would not be me,

286
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,595
and I now like being myself better

287
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,648
than the idea of being someone else,

288
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:08,296
someone who, to be honest,

289
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:10,380
I have neither the option of being

290
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,857
nor the ability fully to imagine.

291
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:15,009
But if you banish the dragons,

292
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,574
you banish the heroes,

293
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,115
and we become attached

294
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,243
to the heroic strain in our own lives.

295
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,524
I've sometimes wondered

296
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:26,306
whether I could have ceased
to hate that part of myself

297
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,887
without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,

298
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:33,388
of which this speech is one manifestation.

299
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:36,285
I used to think I would know myself to be mature

300
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:39,139
when I could simply be gay without emphasis,

301
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,048
but the self-loathing of that period left a void,

302
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,783
and celebration needs to fill and overflow it,

303
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:50,477
and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy,

304
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:53,233
there's still an outer world of homophobia

305
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,122
that it will take decades to address.

306
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,437
Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,

307
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:02,286
free of party hats and blame,

308
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:03,804
but not yet.

309
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:06,553
A friend of mine who thought gay pride

310
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,467
was getting very carried away with itself,

311
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,031
once suggested that we organize

312
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,053
Gay Humility Week.

313
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:16,520
(Laughter) (Applause)

314
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,658
It's a great idea,

315
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,087
but its time has not yet come.

316
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,072
(Laughter)

317
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,271
And neutrality, which seems to lie

318
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:30,025
halfway between despair and celebration,

319
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:33,211
is actually the endgame.

320
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:35,731
In 29 states in the U.S.,

321
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:38,993
I could legally be fired or denied housing

322
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,159
for being gay.

323
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,780
In Russia, the anti-propaganda law

324
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,757
has led to people being beaten in the streets.

325
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,813
Twenty-seven African countries

326
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:51,711
have passed laws against sodomy,

327
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,950
and in Nigeria, gay people can legally

328
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,408
be stoned to death,

329
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,098
and lynchings have become common.

330
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,188
In Saudi Arabia recently, two men

331
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,093
who had been caught in carnal acts,

332
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:07,760
were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,159
and are now permanently disabled as a result.

334
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,030
So who can forge meaning

335
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,810
and build identity?

336
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,137
Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights,

337
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:22,073
and for the millions who live in unaccepting places

338
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:24,250
with no resources,

339
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,730
dignity remains elusive.

340
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,742
I am lucky to have forged meaning

341
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:31,808
and built identity,

342
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,105
but that's still a rare privilege,

343
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,934
and gay people deserve more collectively

344
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:40,370
than the crumbs of justice.

345
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,421
And yet, every step forward

346
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,487
is so sweet.

347
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,141
In 2007, six years after we met,

348
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,198
my partner and I decided

349
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,932
to get married.

350
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,114
Meeting John had been the discovery

351
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:56,970
of great happiness

352
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,070
and also the elimination of great unhappiness,

353
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,684
and sometimes, I was so occupied

354
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,185
with the disappearance of all that pain

355
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,537
that I forgot about the joy,

356
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:11,284
which was at first the less
remarkable part of it to me.

357
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,985
Marrying was a way to declare our love

358
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:17,971
as more a presence than an absence.

359
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,423
Marriage soon led us to children,

360
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,030
and that meant new meanings

361
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,282
and new identities, ours and theirs.

362
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:29,209
I want my children to be happy,

363
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,990
and I love them most achingly when they are sad.

364
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,670
As a gay father, I can teach them

365
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,347
to own what is wrong in their lives,

366
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,140
but I believe that if I succeed

367
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,460
in sheltering them from adversity,

368
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,350
I will have failed as a parent.

369
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,418
A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me

370
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,387
that Westerners mistakenly think

371
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:52,742
that nirvana is what arrives

372
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:55,485
when all your woe is behind you

373
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:58,724
and you have only bliss to look forward to.

374
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,889
But he said that would not be nirvana,

375
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,399
because your bliss in the present

376
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,398
would always be shadowed by the joy from the past.

377
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:09,228
Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at

378
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,610
when you have only bliss to look forward to

379
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,093
and find in what looked like sorrows

380
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,946
the seedlings of your joy.

381
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,657
And I sometimes wonder

382
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:21,050
whether I could have found such fulfillment

383
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,512
in marriage and children

384
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,565
if they'd come more readily,

385
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:28,590
if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now,

386
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,012
in either of which cases this might be easier.

387
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,591
Perhaps I could.

388
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,928
Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done

389
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:38,061
could have been applied to other topics.

390
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,701
But if seeking meaning

391
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,558
matters more than finding meaning,

392
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,921
the question is not whether I'd be happier

393
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,467
for having been bullied,

394
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,139
but whether assigning meaning

395
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,874
to those experiences

396
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:52,290
has made me a better father.

397
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,298
I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys,

398
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,257
because I did not expect those joys

399
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,785
to be ordinary to me.

400
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,602
I know many heterosexuals who have

401
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:04,868
equally happy marriages and families,

402
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:07,729
but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh,

403
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:11,033
and gay families so exhilaratingly new,

404
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:15,292
and I found meaning in that surprise.

405
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,730
In October, it was my 50th birthday,

406
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,948
and my family organized a party for me,

407
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,437
and in the middle of it,

408
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,854
my son said to my husband

409
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,520
that he wanted to make a speech,

410
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,514
and John said,

411
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:32,136
"George, you can't make a speech. You're four."

412
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,650
(Laughter)

413
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,986
"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I

414
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,035
are going to make speeches tonight."

415
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,940
But George insisted and insisted,

416
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,943
and finally, John took him up to the microphone,

417
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,999
and George said very loudly,

418
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,443
"Ladies and gentlemen,

419
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:52,025
may I have your attention please."

420
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,740
And everyone turned around, startled.

421
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,847
And George said,

422
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:59,178
"I'm glad it's Daddy's birthday.

423
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:02,619
I'm glad we all get cake.

424
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,777
And daddy, if you were little,

425
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,044
I'd be your friend."

426
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,421
And I thought — Thank you.

427
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,720
I thought that I was indebted

428
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,515
even to Bobby Finkel,

429
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:19,252
because all those earlier experiences

430
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,620
were what had propelled me to this moment,

431
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,152
and I was finally unconditionally grateful

432
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:27,927
for a life I'd once have done anything to change.

433
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,972
The gay activist Harvey Milk

434
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,500
was once asked by a younger gay man

435
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,716
what he could do to help the movement,

436
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,127
and Harvey Milk said,

437
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,541
"Go out and tell someone."

438
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,165
There's always somebody who wants to confiscate

439
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,770
our humanity,

440
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,558
and there are always stories that restore it.

441
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,136
If we live out loud,

442
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,802
we can trounce the hatred

443
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:52,216
and expand everyone's lives.

444
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:55,840
Forge meaning. Build identity.

445
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,913
Forge meaning.

446
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,660
Build identity.

447
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,458
And then invite the world

448
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,154
to share your joy.

449
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:07,400
Thank you.

450
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,826
(Applause)

451
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:11,903
Thank you. (Applause)

452
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,002
Thank you. (Applause)

453
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:20,002
Thank you. (Applause)
