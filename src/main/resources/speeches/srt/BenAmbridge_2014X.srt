1
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:15,536
You've heard of your I.Q.,
your general intelligence,

2
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:17,212
but what's your Psy-Q?

3
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:19,449
How much do you know
about what makes you tick,

4
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,194
and how good are you
at predicting other people's behavior

5
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,700
or even your own?

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,979
And how much of what you think you know
about psychology is wrong?

7
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:30,767
Let's find out by counting down
the top 10 myths of psychology.

8
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:34,163
You've probably heard it said
that when it comes to their psychology,

9
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:37,045
it's almost as if men are from Mars
and women are from Venus.

10
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:39,084
But how different
are men and women really?

11
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,338
To find out, let's start
by looking at something

12
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:43,315
on which men and women really do differ

13
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,763
and plotting some psychological
gender differences on the same scale.

14
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,936
One thing men and women
do really differ on

15
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,733
is how far they can throw a ball.

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,623
So if we look at the data for men here,

17
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,094
we see what is called
a normal distribution curve.

18
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:58,302
A few men can throw a ball really far,
and a few men not far at all,

19
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:00,072
but most a kind of average distance.

20
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:02,236
And women share
the same distribution as well,

21
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,285
but actually there's
quite a big difference.

22
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,733
In fact, the average man
can throw a ball further

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,440
than about 98 percent of all women.

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,467
So now let's look at what
some psychological gender differences

25
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:14,324
look like on the same standardized scale.

26
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,910
Any psychologist will tell you

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,455
that men are better
at spatial awareness than women --

28
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,193
so things like map-reading, 
for example -- and it's true,

29
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:23,683
but let's have a look
at the size of this difference.

30
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,070
It's tiny; the lines are so close
together they almost overlap.

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,064
In fact, the average woman is better
than 33 percent of all men,

32
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:32,945
and of course, if that was 50 percent,

33
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:35,001
then the two genders
would be exactly equal.

34
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,659
It's worth bearing in mind that this
difference and the next one I'll show you

35
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,484
are pretty much the biggest
psychological gender differences

36
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:42,921
ever discovered in psychology.

37
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,032
So here's the next one.

38
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:46,470
Any psychologist will tell you
that women are better

39
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,135
with language and grammar than men.

40
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,724
So here's performance
on the standardized grammar test.

41
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,681
There go the women. There go the men.

42
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,380
Again, yes, women are better on average,
but the lines are so close

43
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,867
that 33 percent of men
are better than the average woman,

44
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,540
and again, if it was 50 percent,

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,282
that would represent
complete gender equality.

46
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:06,403
So it's not really
a case of Mars and Venus.

47
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,070
It's more a case of, if anything,
Mars and Snickers:

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,432
basically the same, but one's maybe 
slightly nuttier than the other.

49
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:15,458
I won't say which.

50
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,323
Now we've got you warmed up.

51
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:20,359
Let's psychoanalyze you using
the famous Rorschach inkblot test.

52
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:23,942
So you can probably see two, I dunno,
two bears or two people or something.

53
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,695
But what do you think they're doing?

54
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,879
Put your hand up if you think
they're saying hello.

55
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,690
Not many people. Okay.

56
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,157
Put your hands up if you think
they are high-fiving.

57
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:35,127
Okay. What if you think they're fighting?

58
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,382
Only a few people there.

59
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:39,459
Okay, so if you think they're
saying hello or high-fiving,

60
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,450
then that means you're a friendly person.

61
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,040
If you think they're fighting,

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,356
you're a bit more of a 
nasty, aggressive person.

63
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:47,296
Are you a lover or a fighter, basically.

64
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:48,583
What about this one?

65
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,205
This isn't really a voting one, so on 
three everyone shout out what you see.

66
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,369
One, two, three.
(Audience shouting)

67
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,061
I heard hamster. Who said hamster?

68
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,598
That was very worrying.

69
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:00,111
A guy there said hamster.

70
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:03,419
Well, you should see
some kind of two-legged animal here,

71
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,803
and then the mirror image of them there.

72
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:09,234
If you didn't, then this means
that you have difficulty

73
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:13,324
processing complex situations
where there's a lot going on.

74
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,549
Except, of course,
it doesn't mean that at all.

75
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,220
Rorschach inkblot tests
have basically no validity

76
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,495
when it comes to diagnosing
people's personality

77
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,956
and are not used
by modern-day psychologists.

78
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:26,375
In fact, one recent study found
that when you do try

79
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,434
to diagnose people's personalities
using Rorschach inkblot tests,

80
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,176
schizophrenia was diagnosed

81
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:35,169
in about one sixth of apparently
perfectly normal participants.

82
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,002
So if you didn't do that well on this,

83
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,556
maybe you are not
a very visual type of person.

84
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,925
So let's do another
quick quiz to find out.

85
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,703
When making a cake, do you prefer to --
so hands up for each one again --

86
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:49,472
do you prefer to use
a recipe book with pictures?

87
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,492
Yeah, a few people.

88
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,232
Have a friend talk you through?

89
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,895
Or have a go, making it up
as you go along?

90
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,387
Quite a few people there.

91
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,107
Okay, so if you said A,

92
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,279
then this means that you
are a visual learner

93
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,807
and you learn best when information
is presented in a visual style.

94
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,389
If you said B, it means
you're an auditory learner,

95
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:12,114
that you learn best when information
is presented to you in an auditory format.

96
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:15,049
And if you said C, it means
that you're a kinesthetic learner,

97
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,450
that you learn best when you get stuck in
and do things with your hands.

98
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,608
Except, of course,
as you've probably guessed,

99
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,427
that it doesn't, because
the whole thing is a complete myth.

100
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:27,285
Learning styles are made up and are 
not supported by scientific evidence.

101
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:30,841
So we know this because in
tightly controlled experimental studies,

102
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,962
when learners are given material to learn

103
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,582
either in their preferred style
or an opposite style,

104
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:39,158
it makes no difference at all to the
amount of information that they retain.

105
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,224
And if you think about it
for just a second,

106
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,302
it's just obvious
that this has to be true.

107
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:45,874
It's obvious that
the best presentation format

108
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:49,172
depends not on you,
but on what you're trying to learn.

109
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,299
Could you learn to drive a car,
for example,

110
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,717
just by listening to someone
telling you what to do

111
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,345
with no kinesthetic experience?

112
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,161
Could you solve simultaneous equations

113
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,307
by talking them through in your head
and without writing them down?

114
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,408
Could you revise 
for your architecture exams

115
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:05,081
using interpretive dance
if you're a kinesthetic learner?

116
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,022
No. What you need to do 
is match the material to be learned

117
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:11,797
to the presentation format, not you.

118
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,946
I know many of you are A-level students

119
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,238
that will have recently gotten
your GCSE results.

120
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:18,796
And if you didn't quite get
what you were hoping for,

121
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,143
then you can't really blame
your learning style,

122
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:24,770
but one thing that you might want
to think about blaming is your genes.

123
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,455
So what this is all about is a
recent study at University College London

124
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,009
found that 58 percent of the variation

125
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,260
between different students
and their GCSE results

126
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,917
was down to genetic factors.

127
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:39,053
That sounds like a very precise figure,
so how can we tell?

128
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:42,558
Well, when we want to unpack
the relative contributions

129
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:44,662
of genes and the environment,

130
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,891
what we can do is do a twin study.

131
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,467
So identical twins share
100 percent of their environment

132
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,371
and 100 percent of their genes,

133
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:55,593
whereas non-identical twins
share 100 percent of their environment,

134
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:59,329
but just like any brother and sister,
share only 50 percent of their genes.

135
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,527
So by comparing how similar
GCSE results are in identical twins

136
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,838
versus non-identical twins,

137
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,184
and doing some clever math,

138
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:11,085
we can an idea of how much variation
and performance is due to the environment

139
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,221
and how much is due to genes.

140
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:16,998
And it turns out that it's
about 58 percent due to genes.

141
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:20,761
So this isn't to undermine the hard work
that you and your teachers here put in.

142
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:23,892
If you didn't quite get the GCSE results
that you were hoping for,

143
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:28,398
then you can always try blaming
your parents, or at least their genes.

144
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,426
One thing that you shouldn't blame

145
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,888
is being a left-brained
or right-brained learner,

146
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,699
because again, this is a myth.

147
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,456
So the myth here is that
the left brain is logical,

148
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:39,255
it's good with equations like this,

149
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:43,354
and the right brain is more creative,
so the right brain is better at music.

150
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:46,285
But again, this is a myth
because nearly everything that you do

151
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:49,095
involves nearly all parts
of your brain talking together,

152
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:52,415
even just the most mundane thing
like having a normal conversation.

153
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,758
However, perhaps one reason
why this myth has survived

154
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,000
is that there is
a slight grain of truth to it.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,610
So a related version of the myth

156
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,893
is that left-handed people are
more creative than right-handed people,

157
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:06,347
which kind of makes sense because
your brain controls the opposite hands,

158
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,707
so left-handed people,

159
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,133
the right side of the brain
is slightly more active

160
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,938
than the left-hand side of the brain,

161
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,426
and the idea is the right-hand side
is more creative.

162
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:15,823
Now, it isn't true per se

163
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:19,024
that left-handed people are more creative
than right-handed people.

164
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,439
What is true that ambidextrous people,

165
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,132
or people who use both hands
for different tasks,

166
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:27,894
are more creative thinkers
than one-handed people,

167
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,627
because being ambidextrous involves

168
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:32,356
having both sides of the brain
talk to each other a lot,

169
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,118
which seems to be involved
in creating flexible thinking.

170
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:37,933
The myth of the creative left-hander

171
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,991
arises from the fact
that being ambidextrous

172
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:43,118
is more common amongst 
left-handers than right-handers,

173
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:46,167
so a grain of truth in the idea
of the creative left-hander,

174
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,514
but not much.

175
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,951
A related myth that you've
probably heard of

176
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,324
is that we only use
10 percent of our brains.

177
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:53,850
This is, again, a complete myth.

178
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,569
Nearly everything that we do,
even the most mundane thing,

179
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,752
uses nearly all of our brains.

180
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:02,513
That said, it is of course true

181
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:07,093
that most of us don't use our brainpower
quite as well as we could.

182
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:10,059
So what could we do
to boost our brainpower?

183
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,197
Maybe we could listen
to a nice bit of Mozart.

184
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:14,915
Have you heard of the idea
of the Mozart effect?

185
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:17,872
So the idea is that listening 
to Mozart makes you smarter

186
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,041
and improves your 
performance on I.Q. tests.

187
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,146
Now again, what's interesting
about this myth

188
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:25,587
is that although it's basically a myth,
there is a grain of truth to it.

189
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,361
So the original study found that

190
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:31,142
participants who were played
Mozart music for a few minutes

191
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,441
did better on a subsequent I.Q. test

192
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,854
than participants who simply
sat in silence.

193
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:40,578
But a follow-up study recruited
some people who liked Mozart music

194
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,359
and then another group of people

195
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:45,027
who were fans of 
the horror stories of Stephen King.

196
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:48,591
And they played the people
the music or the stories.

197
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:51,099
The people who preferred
Mozart music to the stories

198
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:53,830
got a bigger I.Q. boost
from the Mozart than the stories,

199
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,668
but the people who preferred
the stories to the Mozart music

200
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:59,775
got a bigger I.Q. boost
from listening to the Stephen King stories

201
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,990
than the Mozart music.

202
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,753
So the truth is that listening
to something that you enjoy

203
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:07,004
perks you up a bit
and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost

204
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,931
on a narrow range of tasks.

205
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:11,299
There's no suggestion that
listening to Mozart,

206
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,924
or indeed Stephen King stories,

207
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:16,346
is going to make you any smarter
in the long run.

208
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:19,286
Another version of the Mozart myth

209
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:24,144
is that listening to Mozart can make you
not only cleverer but healthier, too.

210
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:26,212
Unfortunately, this doesn't
seem to be true

211
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,271
of someone who listened
to the music of Mozart almost every day,

212
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,989
Mozart himself,

213
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,969
who suffered from gonorrhea,
smallpox, arthritis,

214
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:38,483
and, what most people think eventually
killed him in the end, syphilis.

215
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,855
This suggests that Mozart
should have bit more careful, perhaps,

216
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:44,433
when choosing his sexual partners.

217
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,592
But how do we choose a partner?

218
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:51,618
So a myth that I have to say
is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists

219
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:55,241
is that our preferences in a romantic 
partner are a product of our culture,

220
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,172
that they're very culturally specific.

221
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:59,316
But in fact, the data don't back this up.

222
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:03,361
A famous study surveyed people from
[37] different cultures across the globe,

223
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,937
from Americans to Zulus,

224
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,303
on what they look for in a partner.

225
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:09,672
And in every single culture
across the globe,

226
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:13,387
men placed more value
on physical attractiveness in a partner

227
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,687
than did women,

228
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,428
and in every single culture, too,

229
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:21,042
women placed more importance than did men
on ambition and high earning power.

230
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,425
In every culture, too,

231
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,950
men preferred women
who were younger than themselves,

232
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,759
an average of, I think it was 2.66 years,

233
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,408
and in every culture, too,

234
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:32,008
women preferred men
who were older than them,

235
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,818
so an average of 3.42 years,

236
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,533
which is why we've got here
"Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."

237
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,110
So moving on from trying
to score with a partner

238
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,032
to trying to score in basketball
or football or whatever your sport is.

239
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:49,173
The myth here is that sportsmen go through
hot-hand streaks, Americans call them,

240
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:51,373
or purple patches,
we sometimes say in England,

241
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:54,213
where they just can't miss,
like this guy here.

242
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,897
But in fact, what happens is that
if you analyze the pattern

243
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,685
of hits and misses statistically,

244
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,984
it turns out that it's
nearly always at random.

245
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:04,399
Your brain creates patterns
from the randomness.

246
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,756
If you toss a coin,

247
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:09,392
a streak of heads or tails is going 
to come out somewhere in the randomness,

248
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,503
and because the brain likes to see
patterns where there are none,

249
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:15,104
we look at these streaks
and attribute meanings to them

250
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,411
and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"

251
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,721
whereas actually you would
get the same pattern

252
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,366
if you were just getting
hits and misses at random.

253
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:26,692
So an exception to this, however,
is penalty shootouts.

254
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,777
A recent study looking
at penalty shootouts in football

255
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,797
shows that players who represent countries

256
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,421
with a very bad record
in penalty shootouts,

257
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,604
like, for example, England,

258
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:40,365
tend to be quicker to take their shots
than countries with a better record,

259
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,685
and presumably as a result,
they're more likely to miss.

260
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,380
Which raises the question

261
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,769
of if there's any way that we
could improve people's performance.

262
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,767
And one thing you might think about doing

263
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,186
is punishing people for their misses
and seeing if that improves them.

264
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:57,818
This idea, the effect that punishment
can improve performance,

265
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,024
is what participants
thought they were testing

266
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,556
in Milgram's famous learning
and punishment experiment

267
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,564
that you've probably heard about
if you're a psychology student.

268
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:08,386
The story goes that participants
were prepared to give

269
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,687
what they believed to be fatal
electric shocks to a fellow participant

270
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,708
when they got a question wrong,

271
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,517
just because someone
in a white coat told them to.

272
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,932
But this story is a myth
for three reasons.

273
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:23,836
Firstly and most crucially, the lab coat
wasn't white, it was in fact grey.

274
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:28,243
Secondly, the participants
were told before the study

275
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,750
and reminded any time
they raised a concern,

276
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,583
that although the shocks were painful,
they were not fatal

277
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,325
and indeed caused
no permanent damage whatsoever.

278
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,645
And thirdly, participants
didn't give the shocks

279
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:41,293
just because someone
in the coat told them to.

280
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,335
When they were interviewed
after the study,

281
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,843
all the participants said
that they firmly believed

282
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:49,627
that the learning and punishment study
served a worthy scientific purpose

283
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:52,065
which would have
enduring gains for science

284
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:57,934
as opposed to the momentary nonfatal
discomfort caused to the participants.

285
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,423
Okay, so I've been talking
for about 12 minutes now,

286
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:04,109
and you've probably been 
sitting there listening to me,

287
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,329
analyzing my speech patterns 
and body language

288
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,936
and trying to work out if you should
take any notice of what I'm saying,

289
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:12,397
whether I'm telling the truth
or whether I'm lying,

290
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,579
but if so you've
probably completely failed,

291
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,924
because although we all think
we can catch a liar

292
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,017
from their body language
and speech patterns,

293
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,690
hundreds of psychological tests
over the years have shown

294
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,381
that all of us, including
police officers and detectives,

295
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:27,881
are basically at chance when it comes
to detecting lies from body language

296
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,462
and verbal patterns.

297
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,506
Interestingly, there is one exception:

298
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,758
TV appeals for missing relatives.

299
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,743
It's quite easy to predict
when the relatives are missing

300
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:40,074
and when the appealers have in fact
murdered the relatives themselves.

301
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:43,589
So hoax appealers are more likely
to shake their heads, to look away,

302
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,303
and to make errors in their speech,

303
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,318
whereas genuine appealers are more likely

304
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,663
to express hope that the person
will return safely

305
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,404
and to avoid brutal language.

306
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:56,007
So, for example, they might say
"taken from us" rather than "killed."

307
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,664
Speaking of which,
it's about time I killed this talk,

308
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,872
but before I do, I just want 
to give you in 30 seconds

309
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:05,243
the overarching myth of psychology.

310
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:09,540
So the myth is that psychology is just
a collection of interesting theories,

311
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,061
all of which say something useful
and all of which have something to offer.

312
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,560
What I hope to have shown you
in the past few minutes

313
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,145
is that this isn't true.

314
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:20,404
What we need to do is assess
psychological theories

315
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:22,288
by seeing what predictions they make,

316
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:25,109
whether that is that listening to Mozart
makes you smarter,

317
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:29,876
that you learn better when information is
presented in your preferred learning style

318
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:33,341
or whatever it is, all of these
are testable empirical predictions,

319
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,126
and the only way we can make progress

320
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,246
is to test these predictions
against the data

321
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,575
in tightly controlled
experimental studies.

322
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,709
And it's only by doing so
that we can hope to discover

323
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,333
which of these theories
are well supported,

324
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,723
and which, like all the ones
I've told you about today, are myths.

325
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,232
Thank you.

326
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:53,692
(Applause)
