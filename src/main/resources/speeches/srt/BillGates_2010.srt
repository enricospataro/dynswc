1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
And that might seem a bit surprising because

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,820
my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
about the things that we need to invent and deliver

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,820
to help the poorest two billion live better lives.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,820
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,820
in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,820
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
There will be too much rain, not enough rain,

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
things will change in ways

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,820
that their fragile environment simply can't support.

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,820
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Also, the price of energy is very important to them.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,820
to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Now, the price of energy has come down over time.

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,820
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,820
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,820
and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,820
we can make modern materials and do so many things.

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,820
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,820
But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
we need to meet a new constraint,

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,820
and that constraint has to do with CO2.

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
CO2 is warming the planet,

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,820
and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,820
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
that leads to a temperature increase,

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,820
and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,

33
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,820
in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
and so you get ecosystem collapses.

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Now, the exact amount of how you map

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,820
from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
and where the positive feedbacks are,

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.

39
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
but they will be extremely bad.

41
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
I asked the top scientists on this several times:

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Do we really have to get down to near zero?

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
And the answer is that until we get near to zero,

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
the temperature will continue to rise.

46
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
And so that's a big challenge.

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,820
It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
and we can just sort of squeeze under."

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,820
This is something that has to get to zero.

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,

51
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
over 26 billion tons.

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,820
For each American, it's about 20 tons;

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.

54
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.

55
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And, somehow, we have to make changes

56
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
that will bring that down to zero.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
It's been constantly going up.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,820
It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
so we have to go from rapidly rising

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
to falling, and falling all the way to zero.

61
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
This equation has four factors,

62
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
a little bit of multiplication:

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,820
and that's going to be based on the number of people,

65
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
the services each person's using on average,

66
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
the energy on average for each service,

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
So, let's look at each one of these

69
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,820
and see how we can get this down to zero.

70
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.

71
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Now that's back from high school algebra,

72
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
but let's take a look.

73
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
First, we've got population.

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
The world today has 6.8 billion people.

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
That's headed up to about nine billion.

76
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
health care, reproductive health services,

78
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,820
but there we see an increase of about 1.3.

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
The second factor is the services we use.

81
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
This encompasses everything:

82
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,820
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
These are very good things:

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
getting rid of poverty means providing these services

85
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
to almost everyone on the planet.

86
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.

87
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
we probably could cut back and use less,

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,820
but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,

90
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,820
and so, over all, that will more than double

91
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
the services delivered per person.

92
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Here we have a very basic service:

93
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?

94
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out

95
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
and reading their school work under the street lamps.

96
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,

97
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
here finally we have some good news.

98
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
We have something that's not going up.

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,

100
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,820
through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --

101
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
there are a lot of services where you can bring

102
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,820
the energy for that service down quite substantially.

103
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.

104
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
There are other services like how we make fertilizer,

105
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
or how we do air transport,

106
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,820
where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.

107
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,

108
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,820
we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.

109
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
But for these first three factors now,

110
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,

111
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
and that just won't cut it.

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
So let's look at this fourth factor --

113
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
this is going to be a key one --

114
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,820
and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.

115
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?

116
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
If you burn coal, no.

117
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
If you burn natural gas, no.

118
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Almost every way we make electricity today,

119
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,820
except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.

120
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,

121
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
is create a new system.

122
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
And so, we need energy miracles.

123
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,820
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.

125
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
The Internet and its services are a miracle.

126
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,820
So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.

127
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Usually, we don't have a deadline,

128
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.

129
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.

130
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed

131
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.

132
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?

133
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Is there some kind of natural illustration,

134
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,820
some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"

135
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,820
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,

136
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
and somehow people enjoyed that.

137
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
(Laughter)

138
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
It really got them involved in the idea of,

139
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.

140
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,820
So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.

141
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I decided that releasing fireflies

142
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,820
would be my contribution to the environment here this year.

143
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
So here we have some natural fireflies.

144
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.

145
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
(Laughter)

146
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,

147
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
but they don't really add up to much.

148
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,820
We need solutions -- either one or several --

149
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
that have unbelievable scale

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
and unbelievable reliability,

151
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
and, although there's many directions people are seeking,

152
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,820
I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.

154
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Those may make some contribution,

155
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,

156
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
but my key point here

157
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,820
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,

158
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,820
and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,

159
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,820
because they all have significant challenges.

160
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,820
either burning coal or burning natural gas.

162
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,

163
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,820
and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,

164
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,

165
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
and hope it stays there.

166
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,

167
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,820
but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,

168
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,820
and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,

169
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Who's going to be sure?

171
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger

172
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,820
than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?

173
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
This is a lot of volume.

174
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
So that's a tough one.

175
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Next would be nuclear.

176
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
It also has three big problems:

177
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;

178
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,

179
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
that, even though you have these human operators,

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.

181
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
And then what do you do with the waste?

182
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.

183
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
People need to feel good about it.

184
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,820
So three very tough problems that might be solvable,

185
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
and so, should be worked on.

186
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
The last three of the five, I've grouped together.

187
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,820
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.

188
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --

189
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
they have some disadvantages.

190
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,820
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies

191
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
is dramatically less than a power plant.

192
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,820
This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,

193
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.

194
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Also, these are intermittent sources.

195
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,

196
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.

197
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
And so, if you depend on these sources,

198
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
you have to have some way of getting the energy

199
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
during those time periods that it's not available.

200
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
So, we've got big cost challenges here,

201
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
we have transmission challenges:

202
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
for example, say this energy source is outside your country;

203
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
you not only need the technology,

204
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,820
but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.

205
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
And, finally, this storage problem.

206
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at

207
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
all the types of batteries that get made --

208
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,820
for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --

209
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,820
and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,820
and what I found is that all the batteries we make now

211
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.

212
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,

213
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,820
something that's going to be a factor of 100 better

214
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
than the approaches we have now.

215
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,820
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.

216
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source

217
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.

218
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
If you're counting on it for 100 percent,

219
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,820
you need an incredible miracle battery.

220
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach?

221
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?

222
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds.

223
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.

224
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good.

225
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
And, I think, here in the TED group,

226
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,820
we have many people who are already pursuing this.

227
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar

228
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
that has some great solar thermal technologies.

229
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies

230
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,820
that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,

231
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and I'm trying to help back that.

232
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company

233
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.

234
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.

235
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,

236
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,820
so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.

237
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,820
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --

238
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
the one percent, which is the U235 --

239
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,820
we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."

240
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
It is kind of a crazy idea.

241
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,

242
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,820
but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,

243
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers

244
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
that now you can simulate and see that, yes,

245
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,820
with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.

246
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
And, because you're burning that 99 percent,

247
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,820
you have greatly improved cost profile.

248
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,820
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel

249
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
all the leftover waste from today's reactors.

250
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,820
So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.

251
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,820
It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.

252
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,820
You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.

253
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,820
In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.

254
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.

255
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
This is the leftover, the 99 percent,

256
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
where they've taken out the part they burn now,

257
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
so it's called depleted uranium.

258
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.

259
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,

260
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,820
you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.

261
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,820
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,

262
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,820
but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas

263
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
that we need to move forward.

264
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?

265
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
What should our report card look like?

266
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,

267
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
and then look at the intermediate.

268
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,820
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.

269
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
That really is very important, that we get there.

270
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,820
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,

271
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
still some agriculture,

272
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.

273
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
So, to get to that 80 percent,

274
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,820
the developed countries, including countries like China,

275
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,820
will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.

276
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,820
So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,

277
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
have we deployed it in all the developed countries

278
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere?

279
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
That's super important.

280
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
That's a key element of making that report card.

281
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,820
So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?

282
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Well, again, it should have the two elements.

283
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:

284
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,

285
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
and, therefore, the less the temperature.

286
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
But in some ways, the grade we get there,

287
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,820
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,

288
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,820
is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,

289
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,820
which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.

290
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,

291
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
and we can measure that in terms of companies,

292
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.

293
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.

294
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice"

295
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."

296
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
They really go through it and create a framework

297
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
that this can be discussed broadly,

298
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
because we need broad backing for this.

299
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
There's a lot that has to come together.

300
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
So this is a wish.

301
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,820
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.

302
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --

303
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I could pick who's president,

304
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,820
I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,

305
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
or I could pick that this thing

306
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,820
that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --

307
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
this is the wish I would pick.

308
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
This is the one with the greatest impact.

309
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
If we don't get this wish,

310
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,820
the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,

311
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,

312
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,820
and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.

313
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
So, what do we have to do?

314
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,820
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?

315
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
We need to go for more research funding.

316
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,

317
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.

318
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
They should discuss this innovation agenda,

319
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,820
and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending

320
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
on these innovative approaches.

321
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,820
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --

322
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
something that gets that price signal out there.

323
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
We need to get the message out.

324
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,

325
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
including the steps that the government takes.

326
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,820
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.

327
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Thank you.

328
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:46,820
(Applause)

329
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Thank you.

330
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

331
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,820
(Applause)

332
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --

333
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?

334
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,

335
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
hire all the great scientists, which we've done,

336
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,820
that's only tens of millions,

337
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor

338
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,820
to make sure that our materials work properly,

339
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.

340
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,820
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor;

341
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,820
finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location

342
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
that will actually build the first one of these.

343
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,

344
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,

345
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
are so different than nuclear as we know it.

346
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground

347
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,820
almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,

348
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
of this sort of spent uranium,

349
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,820
and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?

350
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,820
BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,

351
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,820
so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:

352
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,820
that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out,

353
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
that's not good.

354
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,820
So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --

355
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
just think of it as a log --

356
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,820
put it down and not have those same complexities.

357
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,820
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.

358
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,820
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.

359
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,

360
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,820
you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --

361
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
then you can actually take that,

362
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
and put it into another one and burn that.

363
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,820
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,

364
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,820
that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --

365
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
that's our fuel to begin with.

366
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,820
So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors

367
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
is actually what gets fed into ours,

368
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically

369
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
as you're going through this process.

370
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world

371
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
about the possibilities here.

372
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,820
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?

373
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,820
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,

374
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,820
and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear,"

375
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
so we've got a lot of interest,

376
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,820
that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --

377
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,

378
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,820
talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.

379
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.

380
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,820
This is a variant on something that has been done.

381
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,820
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,

382
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
and a lot of countries have built them,

383
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,820
so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.

384
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,820
CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood

385
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820
of actually taking something like this live?

386
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,820
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things

387
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
that's very cheap,

388
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,820
we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.

389
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,820
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models

390
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
have shown us that we have to meet.

391
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,820
And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --

392
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
could easily meet that.

393
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --

394
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
we need it to be hundreds --

395
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
who, likewise, if their science goes well,

396
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,820
if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,

397
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
that they can compete for this.

398
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
And it's best if multiple succeed,

399
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,820
because then you could use a mix of these things.

400
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
We certainly need one to succeed.

401
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,820
CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes,

402
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,820
is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?

403
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,820
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.

404
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,

405
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,820
but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.

406
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,820
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.

407
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,820
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,

408
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,820
but the modular people, that's a different approach.

409
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,820
There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,

410
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
but maybe they say that about us.

411
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
And so, there are different ones,

412
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,820
but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium

413
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,820
has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,

414
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,820
and so -- if you can deal with the negatives,

415
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,820
which are essentially the radiation --

416
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,820
the footprint and cost, the potential,

417
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
in terms of effect on land and various things,

418
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,820
is almost in a class of its own.

419
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,820
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?

420
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,820
Do we have to start taking emergency measures

421
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?

422
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
BG: If you get into that situation,

423
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,820
it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:

424
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,820
Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.

425
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,820
There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,

426
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,820
which are various techniques that would delay the heating

427
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,820
to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.

428
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Now, that's just an insurance policy.

429
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,820
You hope you don't need to do that.

430
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy

431
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
because it might make you lazy,

432
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,820
that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.

433
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,

434
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,820
but there's now the geoengineering discussion

435
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,820
about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,

436
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,820
or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?

437
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,820
CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,

438
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,820
how might you persuade them that they're wrong?

439
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,820
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.

440
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,820
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.

441
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,820
Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects

442
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
that have to do with clouds that offset things?

443
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,820
There are very, very few things that they can even say

444
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,820
there's a chance in a million of those things.

445
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,820
The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.

446
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,820
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.

447
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,820
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,

448
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,820
the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,

449
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,820
and a somewhat uncertain pain thing --

450
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,820
in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case,

451
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC

452
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,820
and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal."

453
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,820
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.

454
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,820
But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,

455
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
and meet the CO2 constraints,

456
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
then the skeptics say, "OK,

457
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,

458
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
I kind of wish it did put out CO2,

459
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,820
but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before."

460
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,820
(Applause)

461
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,820
CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,

462
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,820
that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,

463
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,820
it's going to take away all your other goals

464
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,820
of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,

465
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,820
it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that

466
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,820
when there are better things we can do.

467
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,820
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece --

468
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,820
say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --

469
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
it's not that dramatic.

470
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
It shouldn't take away from other things.

471
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,820
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,

472
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,820
is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that --

473
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,820
that, to me, mostly is a waste.

474
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve

475
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
and it's going to get very cheap,

476
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,820
I believe we should try more things that have a potential

477
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,820
to be far less expensive.

478
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,820
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"

479
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
then the rich can afford that.

480
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,820
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy

481
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
and not change our lifestyle.

482
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
The disaster is for that two billion.

483
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
And even Lomborg has changed.

484
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,820
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"

485
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
He's still, because of his earlier stuff,

486
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
still associated with the skeptic camp,

487
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,820
but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,

488
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,820
and so, he's making the R&D point.

489
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,820
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.

490
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,820
The R&D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded.

491
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,820
CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here

492
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,820
to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.

493
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,820
BG: Thank you.

494
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,820
