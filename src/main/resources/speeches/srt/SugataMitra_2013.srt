1
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:18,510
What is going to be the future of learning?

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,790
I do have a plan,

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,870
but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,840
I need to tell you a little story,

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,686
which kind of sets the stage.

6
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,473
I tried to look at

7
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:34,880
where did the kind of learning we do in schools,

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,150
where did it come from?

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,582
And you can look far back into the past,

10
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,395
but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,

11
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:47,097
it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.

12
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:51,045
It came from about 300 years ago,

13
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:53,262
and it came from the last

14
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,230
and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,575
Imagine trying to run the show,

16
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:00,983
trying to run the entire planet,

17
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:04,807
without computers, without telephones,

18
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:08,939
with data handwritten on pieces of paper,

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,489
and traveling by ships.

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,643
But the Victorians actually did it.

21
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:17,811
What they did was amazing.

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,123
They created a global computer

23
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,179
made up of people.

24
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,972
It's still with us today.

25
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:31,951
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.

26
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,278
In order to have that machine running,

27
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:38,479
you need lots and lots of people.

28
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,838
They made another machine to produce those people:

29
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:45,734
the school.

30
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,511
The schools would produce the people

31
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:52,360
who would then become parts of the

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,745
bureaucratic administrative machine.

33
00:01:55,745 --> 00:02:00,135
They must be identical to each other.

34
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:02,292
They must know three things:

35
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:05,332
They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;

36
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,487
they must be able to read;

37
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,766
and they must be able to do multiplication,

38
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:13,429
division, addition and subtraction in their head.

39
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,956
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand

40
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,291
and ship them to Canada

41
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,372
and he would be instantly functional.

42
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:26,241
The Victorians were great engineers.

43
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:29,730
They engineered a system that was so robust

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,185
that it's still with us today,

45
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,161
continuously producing identical people

46
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:40,977
for a machine that no longer exists.

47
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,905
The empire is gone,

48
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,809
so what are we doing with that design

49
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,178
that produces these identical people,

50
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:52,081
and what are we going to do next

51
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:56,001
if we ever are going to do anything else with it?

52
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,691
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]

53
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,583
So that's a pretty strong comment there.

54
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,377
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.

55
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:05,111
I'm not saying they're broken.

56
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,108
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.

57
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,759
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.

58
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,985
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.

59
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,392
What are the kind of jobs that we have today?

60
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:22,526
Well, the clerks are the computers.

61
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:25,057
They're there in thousands in every office.

62
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:28,262
And you have people who guide those computers

63
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:30,739
to do their clerical jobs.

64
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,003
Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.

65
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:37,035
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.

66
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,307
They do need to be able to read.

67
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:43,457
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.

68
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,564
Well, that's today, but we don't even know

69
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:49,123
what the jobs of the future are going to look like.

70
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,767
We know that people will work from wherever they want,

71
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,965
whenever they want, in whatever way they want.

72
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:59,153
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them

73
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:01,696
for that world?

74
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:06,744
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.

75
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:09,376
I used to teach people how to write computer programs

76
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,840
in New Delhi, 14 years ago.

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,597
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.

78
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:18,184
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids

79
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:20,704
ever going to learn to write computer programs?

80
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:23,784
Or should they not?

81
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:26,401
At the same time, we also had lots of parents,

82
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,832
rich people, who had computers,

83
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:31,963
and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,

84
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:34,152
I think he's gifted,

85
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:37,026
because he does wonderful things with computers.

86
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,002
And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."

87
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,110
And so on. So I suddenly figured that,

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,906
how come all the rich people are having

89
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,047
these extraordinarily gifted children?

90
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,962
(Laughter)

91
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:51,786
What did the poor do wrong?

92
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,789
I made a hole in the boundary wall

93
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,821
of the slum next to my office,

94
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,565
and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen

95
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,549
if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,

96
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,885
didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.

97
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:06,837
The children came running in.

98
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,007
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"

99
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,991
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."

100
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:14,207
(Laughter)

101
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,763
They said, "Why have you put it there?"

102
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:17,978
I said, "Just like that."

103
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,987
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."

104
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,364
And I went away.

105
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,108
About eight hours later,

106
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:28,063
we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.

107
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,560
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,101
How is it possible? They don't know anything."

109
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,965
My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.

110
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,788
One of your students must have been passing by,

111
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:41,883
showed them how to use the mouse."

112
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,406
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."

113
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:46,465
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi

114
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,456
into a really remote village

115
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,248
where the chances of a passing software development engineer

116
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:56,664
was very little. (Laughter)

117
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:59,327
I repeated the experiment there.

118
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,614
There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,

119
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:03,814
I went away, came back after a couple of months,

120
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,509
found kids playing games on it.

121
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:06,460
When they saw me, they said,

122
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,942
"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."

123
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:13,236
(Laughter)

124
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:16,645
So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"

125
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:19,100
And they said something very interesting to me.

126
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,765
In an irritated voice, they said,

127
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:23,318
"You've given us a machine that works only in English,

128
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:29,403
so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)

129
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:31,380
That's the first time, as a teacher,

130
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,471
that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.

131
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:40,073
Here's a short glimpse from those years.

132
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:42,720
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.

133
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,958
On your right is an eight-year-old.

134
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:50,678
To his left is his student. She's six.

135
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:54,275
And he's teaching her how to browse.

136
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,561
Then onto other parts of the country,

137
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,844
I repeated this over and over again,

138
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:03,289
getting exactly the same results that we were.

139
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,216
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]

140
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:11,481
An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.

141
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,837
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,

142
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:26,086
and said, "There's a processor inside."

143
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:28,579
So I started publishing.

144
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,134
I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,

145
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,336
and I said, in nine months, a group of children

146
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,034
left alone with a computer in any language

147
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:40,549
will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.

148
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:45,309
I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.

149
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,041
But I was curious to know, what else would they do

150
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,281
if they could do this much?

151
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,809
I started experimenting with other subjects,

152
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:55,777
among them, for example, pronunciation.

153
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,225
There's one community of children in southern India

154
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,993
whose English pronunciation is really bad,

155
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:04,513
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.

156
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:08,591
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,

157
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:11,865
and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."

158
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:16,497
(Laughter)

159
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:21,681
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.

160
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:27,193
Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.

161
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,464
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face

162
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:33,281
of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.

163
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,777
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad

164
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:41,499
and may have tortured you about your credit card bills

165
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:46,272
in a very clear English accent.

166
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:50,649
So then people said, well, how far will it go?

167
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,219
Where does it stop?

168
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:55,582
I decided I would destroy my own argument

169
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:58,086
by creating an absurd proposition.

170
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:01,974
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.

171
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,778
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,

172
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,423
can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village

173
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,928
learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English

174
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,175
from a streetside computer?

175
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,360
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.

176
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,414
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,

177
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:19,718
I'll go back, they'll get another zero.

178
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:24,074
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.

179
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:28,137
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.

180
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,814
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,

181
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:34,501
downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,

182
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,806
most of which I didn't understand.

183
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,783
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"

184
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:45,791
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."

185
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,145
So they said, "How can we understand such big English words

186
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,223
and diagrams and chemistry?"

187
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,047
So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,

188
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,931
so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."

189
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,126
(Laughter)

190
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:03,076
"And anyway, I am going away."

191
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:07,444
(Laughter)

192
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:11,033
So I left them for a couple of months.

193
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,668
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.

194
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:14,592
I came back after two months

195
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:18,252
and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."

196
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,327
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?"

197
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:24,412
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you

198
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:27,173
before you decided that you can't understand anything?"

199
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,121
So they said, "We haven't given up.

200
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,097
We look at it every single day."

201
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,562
So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens

202
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:36,266
and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"

203
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,779
So a little girl who you see just now,

204
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,511
she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,

205
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,708
she said, "Well, apart from the fact that

206
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,859
improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,

207
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,380
we haven't understood anything else."

208
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,092
(Laughter) (Applause)

209
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:59,212
So I tested them.

210
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:02,484
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent

211
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:04,788
in two months in the tropical heat

212
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:08,228
with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know

213
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,300
doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.

214
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,677
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.

215
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,077
Thirty percent is a fail.

216
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:23,013
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.

217
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:27,850
I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,

218
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,236
a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant

219
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:32,684
and she played with them all the time.

220
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,805
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"

221
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:37,076
So she says, "Absolutely not.

222
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,153
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea

223
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:44,682
what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."

224
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:49,213
I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."

225
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,543
So she says, "What's that?"

226
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,930
I said, "Stand behind them.

227
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,536
Whenever they do anything, you just say,

228
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,333
'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?

229
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,445
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'

230
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:02,367
You know what grannies do."

231
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,541
So she did that for two more months.

232
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,455
The scores jumped to 50 percent.

233
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:09,109
Kallikuppam had caught up

234
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,987
with my control school in New Delhi,

235
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:15,123
a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.

236
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:19,960
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.

237
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,056
Here's Kallikuppam.

238
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:30,251
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.

239
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,942
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,

240
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,438
but what she was saying, as you could make out,

241
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,845
was about neurons, with her hands were like that,

242
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,401
and she was saying neurons communicate.

243
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,745
At 12.

244
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,955
So what are jobs going to be like?

245
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:51,246
Well, we know what they're like today.

246
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,584
What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,

247
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,637
children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand

248
00:12:56,637 --> 00:13:00,410
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.

249
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,369
What will it be tomorrow?

250
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:09,269
Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?

251
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,809
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,

252
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,129
you can find out in two minutes?

253
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,234
Could it be -- a devastating question,

254
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,026
a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --

255
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,065
could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in

256
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:29,425
a future where knowing is obsolete?

257
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,958
But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.

258
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,875
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.

259
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,652
But look at it this way.

260
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,198
It took nature 100 million years

261
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:42,334
to make the ape stand up

262
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,518
and become Homo sapiens.

263
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:48,214
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.

264
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:50,396
What an achievement that is.

265
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,423
But we have to integrate that into our own future.

266
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:57,382
Encouragement seems to be the key.

267
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:58,592
If you look at Kuppam,

268
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:01,406
if you look at all of the experiments that I did,

269
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:08,541
it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.

270
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,935
There is evidence from neuroscience.

271
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:14,137
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,

272
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:17,873
when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,

273
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,551
it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,

274
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,295
it shuts all of that down.

275
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:28,443
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.

276
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:32,068
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,

277
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:34,764
and then we say, "Perform."

278
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:38,245
Why did they create a system like that?

279
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,891
Because it was needed.

280
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,476
There was an age in the Age of Empires

281
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:46,746
when you needed those people who can survive under threat.

282
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:49,013
When you're standing in a trench all alone,

283
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,044
if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.

284
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:56,017
If you didn't, you failed.

285
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:58,673
But the Age of Empires is gone.

286
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:02,311
What happens to creativity in our age?

287
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:05,326
We need to shift that balance back

288
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:08,735
from threat to pleasure.

289
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:12,687
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.

290
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,704
I put out notices in papers saying,

291
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:19,124
if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,

292
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,351
can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?

293
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,463
I got 200 in the first two weeks.

294
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:29,371
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)

295
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:33,186
They're called the Granny Cloud.

296
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:34,916
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.

297
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:39,290
If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.

298
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,859
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.

299
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,478
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles

300
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,523
in northwestern England,

301
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,827
deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,

302
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,067
6,000 miles away.

303
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,643
She does it with only one age-old gesture.

304
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,358
"Shhh."

305
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,083
Okay?

306
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,619
Watch this.

307
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,875
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.

308
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,643
You can't catch me.

309
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,611
Children: You can't catch me.

310
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:20,193
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.

311
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:24,783
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.

312
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,241
SM: So what's happening here?

313
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,085
I think what we need to look at is

314
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,466
we need to look at learning

315
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:36,054
as the product of educational self-organization.

316
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:38,899
If you allow the educational process to self-organize,

317
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,390
then learning emerges.

318
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,783
It's not about making learning happen.

319
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,999
It's about letting it happen.

320
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:49,272
The teacher sets the process in motion

321
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,991
and then she stands back in awe

322
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,359
and watches as learning happens.

323
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,312
I think that's what all this is pointing at.

324
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,064
But how will we know? How will we come to know?

325
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:01,739
Well, I intend to build

326
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:05,040
these Self-Organized Learning Environments.

327
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,725
They are basically broadband, collaboration

328
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,118
and encouragement put together.

329
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,824
I've tried this in many, many schools.

330
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,359
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers

331
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,985
sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"

332
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:22,102
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"

333
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:25,595
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me

334
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:28,523
and where they're from."

335
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:31,267
Here's a SOLE in action.

336
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:37,376
(Children talking)

337
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:43,665
This one is in England.

338
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:47,431
He maintains law and order,

339
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:55,946
because remember, there's no teacher around.

340
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,819
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia

341
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:08,554
Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.

342
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,138
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons

343
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,431
in the ion minus the number of electrons.

344
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:18,480
SM: A decade ahead of her time.

345
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,083
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.

346
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,289
You already heard about that. You know what that means.

347
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,690
There was a time when Stone Age men and women

348
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,794
used to sit and look up at the sky and say,

349
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:32,273
"What are those twinkling lights?"

350
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:37,067
They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.

351
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:41,197
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.

352
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,905
But that's not sexy enough.

353
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,866
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,

354
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:51,019
"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,

355
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,417
how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"

356
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,977
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"

357
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,962
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"

358
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:02,833
and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.

359
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:07,291
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.

360
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:12,880
I've tried incredible, incredible questions --

361
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,168
"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —

362
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:19,113
to nine-year-olds.

363
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:22,089
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.

364
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,047
This is done by children without the help of any teacher.

365
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,431
The teacher only raises the question,

366
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,095
and then stands back and admires the answer.

367
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:36,831
So what's my wish?

368
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,047
My wish is

369
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:43,361
that we design the future of learning.

370
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:45,327
We don't want to be spare parts

371
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,719
for a great human computer, do we?

372
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,375
So we need to design a future for learning.

373
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,011
And I've got to -- hang on,

374
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:55,711
I've got to get this wording exactly right,

375
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,355
because, you know, it's very important.

376
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,671
My wish is to help design a future of learning

377
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,905
by supporting children all over the world

378
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,951
to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.

379
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,183
Help me build this school.

380
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:11,519
It will be called the School in the Cloud.

381
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,592
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures

382
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,449
driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.

383
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,720
The way I want to do this

384
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,080
is to build a facility where I can study this.

385
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,880
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.

386
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,647
There's only one granny

387
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,088
who manages health and safety.

388
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:35,521
The rest of it's from the cloud.

389
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,436
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,

390
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,464
etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.

391
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:42,689
But I want you for another purpose.

392
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:45,448
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments

393
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:50,464
at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.

394
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:52,592
It's very easy to do. There's a great document

395
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,480
produced by TED which tells you how to do it.

396
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,856
If you would please, please do it

397
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,221
across all five continents

398
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,432
and send me the data,

399
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:05,936
then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,

400
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,200
and create the future of learning.

401
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,992
That's my wish.

402
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,415
And just one last thing.

403
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:15,008
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.

404
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:18,311
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,

405
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,296
I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,

406
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:22,751
and the children flocked there.

407
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,648
And there was this little girl who was following me around.

408
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:30,364
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.

409
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,765
I don't know, what should I do?"

410
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:36,796
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.

411
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,852
She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,

412
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,741
"Get on with it."

413
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:54,605
(Laughter) (Applause)

414
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,466
I think it was good advice.

415
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,534
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.

416
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:02,524
Thank you. Thank you very much.

417
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:06,275
(Applause)

418
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:14,599
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

419
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:21,014
Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)
