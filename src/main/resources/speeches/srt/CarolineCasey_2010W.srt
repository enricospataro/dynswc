1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Can any of you

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
remember what you wanted to be

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
when you were 17?

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
Do you know what I wanted to be?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
I wanted to be a biker chick.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
(Laughter)

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I wanted to race cars,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and I wanted to be a cowgirl,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,820
Because they were all about being free,

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
the wind in your hair -- just to be free.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
And on my seventeenth birthday,

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
gave me one driving lesson

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
for my seventeenth birthday.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
Not that we could have afforded I drive,

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
but to give me the dream of driving.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
And on my seventeenth birthday,

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
I accompanied my little sister

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
in complete innocence,

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
as I always had all my life --

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
my visually impaired sister --

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
to go to see an eye specialist.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Because big sisters

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
are always supposed to support their little sisters.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
God help her.

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
So I used to get my eyes tested

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
just for fun.

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
And on my seventeenth birthday,

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
after my fake eye exam,

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.

33
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
And I took that driving lesson,

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,820
and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
And then there was a silence --

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
one of those awful silences

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
when you know something's wrong.

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
And he turned to my mother,

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,820
and he said, "You haven't told her yet?"

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
On my seventeenth birthday,

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
as Janis Ian would best say,

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
I learned the truth at 17.

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,820
I am, and have been since birth,

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
legally blind.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
And you know,

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
how on earth did I get to 17

48
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
and not know that?

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
let me tell you this:

51
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
I got there

52
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
because my father's passion for Johnny Cash

53
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and a song, "A Boy Named Sue."

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.

55
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And very shortly after my birth,

56
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And what the hell does that mean to you?

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,

60
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)

61
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
I might buy some more time.

62
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
But more importantly, let me tell you --

63
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.

64
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Hey.

65
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
See this hand?

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Every man in this room, even you, Steve,

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
is George Clooney.

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
(Laughter)

70
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
And every woman, you are so beautiful.

71
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,

72
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face

73
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
from all the squinting I've done all my life

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
from all the dark lights.

75
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
The really strange part is

76
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,

77
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
my parents made a bizarre, unusual

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,820
and incredibly brave decision.

79
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
No special needs schools.

80
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
No labels.

81
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
No limitations.

82
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
My ability and my potential.

83
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
And they decided to tell me

84
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
that I could see.

85
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,

86
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
a boy given a girl's name,

87
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
I would grow up and learn from experience

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
how to be tough and how to survive,

89
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
when they were no longer there to protect me,

90
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
or just take it all away.

91
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
But more significantly,

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
they gave me the ability

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
to believe,

94
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
totally, to believe that I could.

95
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And so when I heard that eye specialist

96
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,820
tell me all the things, a big fat "no,"

97
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
everybody imagines I was devastated.

98
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --

99
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --

100
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I got that thump in my chest,

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
just that "huh?"

102
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.

103
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
The first thing I thought about was my mom,

104
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
who was crying over beside me.

105
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
"I will drive. I will drive.

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."

108
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
And with the same dogged determination

109
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
that my father had bred into me since I was such a child --

110
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
he taught me how to sail,

111
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,

112
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.

113
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
But he told me to believe

114
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
and feel the wind in my face.

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
And that wind in my face made me believe

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
that he was mad and I would drive.

117
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
And for the next 11 years,

118
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,

119
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
because I didn't want to be a failure,

120
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
and I didn't want to be weak.

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
And I believed I could do it.

122
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.

123
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.

124
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.

125
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.

126
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
And then I went to business school.

127
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.

128
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.

129
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
And they didn't even know.

130
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
And it's extraordinary

131
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
how far belief can take you.

132
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
In 1999,

133
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
two and a half years into that job,

134
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
something happened.

135
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.

136
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
And temporarily,

137
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
very unexpectedly,

138
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
they dropped.

139
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,

140
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.

141
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
And two years in,

142
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,820
I really could see very little.

143
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,820
And I found myself in front of an HR manager

144
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
in 1999,

145
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
saying something I never imagined that I would say.

146
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
I was 28 years old.

147
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,820
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.

148
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
And I simply said,

149
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
"I'm sorry.

150
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,820
I can't see, and I need help."

151
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.

152
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.

153
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We all know how hard it is

154
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
to admit weakness and failure.

155
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
And it's frightening, isn't it?

156
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
But all that belief had fueled me so long.

157
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,820
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,

158
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
it's kind of difficult -- it really is.

159
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.

160
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Oh, for the love of God.

161
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
And please, any designers out there?

162
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.

163
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
I always end up in the gents' toilets.

164
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.

165
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
But can I just tell you,

166
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet

167
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
is determined by a triangle.

168
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Have you ever tried to see that

169
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?

170
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
It's such a small thing, right?

171
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
And you know how exhausting it can be

172
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
to try to be perfect when you're not,

173
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
or to be somebody that you aren't?

174
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,

175
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
they sent me off to an eye specialist.

176
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.

177
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
But before I got to him, I was so lost.

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
I had no idea who I was anymore.

179
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.

180
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
God no, it was therapy.

181
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
And he asked me several questions,

182
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
of which many were, "Why?

183
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Why are you fighting so hard

184
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
not to be yourself?

185
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
And do you love what you do, Caroline?"

186
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,

187
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
they put a chip in your head, and you're like,

188
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.

189
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)

190
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
To leave would be failure.

191
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
And he said, "Do you love it?"

192
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.

193
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
I just was so -- how do I tell him?

194
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"

195
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."

196
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.

197
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
He thought I was mad enough anyway.

198
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And as I left his office,

199
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
he called me back

200
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
and he said, "I think it's time.

201
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
I think it's time

202
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
to stop fighting and do something different."

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And that door closed.

204
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And that silence just outside a doctor's office,

205
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
that many of us know.

206
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
And my chest ached.

207
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.

208
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
But I did know the game was up.

209
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,

210
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
I thought, "I'll go out for a run."

211
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Really not a very sensible thing to do.

212
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
And I went on a run that I know so well.

213
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I always run it perfectly fine.

215
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things

216
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.

217
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
And there was a rock that I always missed.

218
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And I'd never fallen on it, never.

219
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
And there I was crying away,

220
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
and smash, bash on my rock.

221
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Broken, fallen over

222
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
on this rock

223
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
in the middle of March in 2000,

224
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --

225
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
gray, snot, tears everywhere,

226
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
ridiculously self-pitying.

227
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
And I was floored, and I was broken,

228
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and I was angry.

229
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
And I didn't know what to do.

230
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
And I sat there for quite some time going,

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?

232
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Because who am I going to be?

233
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
What am I going to be?"

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
And I thought about my dad,

235
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."

236
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?

238
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
And you know, the extraordinary part of it

239
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
is I just simply had no answers.

240
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
I had lost my belief.

241
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Look where my belief had brought me to.

242
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.

243
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I was crumpled.

244
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist

245
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?

246
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?

247
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Do something different. What do you want to be?

248
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Do something different. What do you want to be?"

249
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And really slowly, slowly, slowly,

250
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
it happened.

251
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
And it did happen this way.

252
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
And then the minute it came,

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
it blew up in my head

254
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
and bashed in my heart --

255
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
something different.

256
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?

257
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
You don't get more different than that."

258
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
And the moment, and I mean the moment,

259
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
the moment that hit me,

260
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
I swear to God,

261
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.

262
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
And nobody can tell me no.

263
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.

264
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?

265
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.

266
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.

267
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.

268
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.

269
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,

270
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.

271
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch

272
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
going, "I know what I'm going to do.

273
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
I know how to be Mowgli.

274
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
I'm going to go across India

275
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
on the back of an elephant.

276
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm going to be an elephant handler."

277
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
And I had no idea

278
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
how I was going to be an elephant handler.

279
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
From global management consultant to elephant handler.

280
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.

281
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.

282
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
But I knew I would.

283
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,

284
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
God, that universe makes it happen for you.

285
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,

286
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
I had the only blind date in my life

287
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.

288
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers

289
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
across India.

290
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
(Applause)

291
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
The most powerful thing of all,

292
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.

293
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.

294
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Because I wasn't believing in me,

295
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
really me, all the bits of me --

296
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
all the bits of all of us.

297
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?

298
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,

299
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
it's extraordinary what happens.

300
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,

301
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.

302
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Six thousand people got to see because of that.

303
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
When I came home off that elephant,

304
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
do you know what the most amazing part was?

305
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I chucked in my job at Accenture.

306
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,

307
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,

308
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
which deals with Asian elephant conservation.

309
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And I set up Kanchi,

310
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,

311
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
because disability is like the elephant in the room.

312
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --

313
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
no charity, no pity.

314
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
But I wanted to work only and truly

315
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
with business and media leadership

316
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
to totally reframe disability

317
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
in a way that was exciting and possible.

318
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
It was extraordinary.

319
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
That's what I wanted to do.

320
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,

321
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
or any of that kind of nothing.

322
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
It just seemed that it was possible.

323
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
And you know, the oddest part is,

324
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
when I was on my way traveling here to TED,

325
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
I'll be honest, I was petrified.

326
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
And I speak,

327
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
but this is an amazing audience,

328
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
and what am I doing here?

329
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
But as I was traveling here,

330
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
you'll be very happy to know,

331
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I did use my white symbol stick cane,

332
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.

333
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
And I got my way here

334
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
being happily proud that I couldn't see.

335
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,

336
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.

337
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Even though I present confident, I was scared.

338
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
He said, "Be you."

339
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
And so here I am.

340
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
This is me, all of me.

341
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:15,820
(Applause)

342
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
And I have learned, you know what,

343
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
cars and motorbikes and elephants,

344
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
that's not freedom.

345
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.

346
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
And I never needed eyes to see -- never.

347
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
I simply needed vision and belief.

348
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
And if you truly believe --

349
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --

350
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
you can make change happen.

351
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
And we need to make it happen,

352
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
because every single one of us --

353
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
woman, man, gay, straight,

354
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
disabled, perfect,

355
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
normal, whatever --

356
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
everyone of us

357
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
must be the very best of ourselves.

358
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
I no longer want anybody to be invisible.

359
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
We all have to be included.

360
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
And stop with the labels, the limiting.

361
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Losing of labels,

362
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
because we are not jam jars.

363
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.

364
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Thank you.

365
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:23,820
(Applause)
