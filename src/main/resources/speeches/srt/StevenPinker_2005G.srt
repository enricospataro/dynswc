1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
This is a picture of Maurice Druon,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
the French Academy.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
befitting the role of the French Academy

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
as legislating the

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
correct usage in French

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
and perpetuating the language.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
The French Academy has two main tasks:

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
it compiles a dictionary of official French.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
They're now working on their ninth edition,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
They also legislate on correct usage,

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,820
such as the proper term for what the French call "email,"

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
which ought to be "courriel."

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
The World Wide Web, the French are told,

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
ought to be referred to as

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,820
"la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web --

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,820
recommendations that the French gaily ignore.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
namely, it's legislated by an academy.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
But anyone who looks at language realizes

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,820
that this is a rather silly conceit,

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
it will already be well out of date.

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
We see it in the

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,820
constant appearance of slang and jargon,

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
of the historical change in languages,

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
in divergence of dialects

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
and the formation of new languages.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,

34
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
so much as a window onto human nature.

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
In a book that I'm currently working on,

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
I hope to use language to shed light on

37
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
a number of aspects of human nature,

38
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
including the cognitive machinery

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
with which humans conceptualize the world

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
and the relationship types that govern human interaction.

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
Let me start off with a technical problem in language

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
that I've worried about for quite some time --

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,820
and indulge me

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
in my passion for verbs and how they're used.

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Let me give you a quick reminder

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
of something that you've long forgotten.

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
An intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
can't take a direct object.

53
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
You have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
A transitive verb mandates

55
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
that there has to be an object there:

56
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,

58
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
each of which shapes its sentence.

59
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,820
So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,820
a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,

61
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
and a problem in programming computers to use language is

62
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
which verbs go in which constructions.

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
For example, the dative construction in English.

64
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.

65
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,820
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
So a tempting generalization for a child,

69
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
for an adult, for a computer

70
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
is that any verb that can appear in the construction,

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"

72
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
can also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
A handy thing to have,

74
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
because language is infinite,

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.

76
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
You've got to extract generalizations

77
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
so you can produce and understand new sentences.

78
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
This would be an example of how to do that.

79
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.

80
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,820
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"

81
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"

83
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."

84
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
are not synonymous,

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
that when you crank up the microscope

87
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference

88
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
in meaning between them.

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
So, "give the X to the Y,"

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
that construction corresponds to the thought

91
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"

92
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."

93
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Now, many events can be subject to either construal,

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,

95
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
in which you can either pay attention

96
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
to the particular object,

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
in which case the space around it recedes from attention,

98
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
or you can see the faces in the empty space,

99
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,820
in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.

100
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
How are these construals reflected in language?

101
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected

102
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
is expressed as the direct object,

103
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
the noun after the verb.

104
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,820
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --

105
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
where you're doing something to the muffin --

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."

107
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"

108
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
you're doing something to the mouse,

109
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."

110
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
So which verbs go in which construction --

111
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
the problem with which I began --

112
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
or a kind of possession change.

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
To give something involves both causing something to go

115
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
and causing someone to have.

116
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
To drive the car only causes something to go,

117
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.

118
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Only humans can possess things.

119
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,

120
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head

121
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
and causing it to go to the other person,

122
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
and implanting it in them.

123
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
You may just be loud or obnoxious,

124
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
or some other way causing them to have the headache.

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,820
So, that's

126
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.

127
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
So why should anyone care?

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,

129
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,820
from this and many similar kinds of analyses

130
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
of hundreds of English verbs.

131
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,

132
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
which we automatically and unconsciously compute

133
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,820
every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.

134
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,820
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."

135
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --

137
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
not only in English, but in all other languages --

138
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
fundamental concepts such as space,

139
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
time, causation and human intention,

140
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
such as, what is the means and what is the ends?

141
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories

142
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
that Immanuel Kant argued

143
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
are the basic framework for human thought,

144
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language

145
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
seems to reflect these Kantian categories.

146
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,

147
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
such as color, texture, weight and speed,

148
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
which virtually never differentiate

149
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
the use of verbs in different constructions.

150
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English

151
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
are used not only literally,

152
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
but in a quasi-metaphorical way.

153
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
For example, this construction, the dative,

154
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
is used not only to transfer things,

155
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,

156
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
as when we say, "She told a story to me"

157
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
or "told me a story,"

158
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."

159
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
It's exactly the same construction,

160
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,820
but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.

161
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
It evokes the container metaphor of communication,

162
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
in which we conceive of ideas as objects,

163
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
sentences as containers,

164
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
and communication as a kind of sending.

165
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
As when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,

166
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
and if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"

167
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
we might get these ideas "across" to a listener,

168
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
who can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."

169
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.

170
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
It's very hard to find any example of abstract language

171
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
that is not based on some concrete metaphor.

172
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
For example, you can use the verb "go"

173
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
and the prepositions "to" and "from"

174
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
in a literal, spatial sense.

175
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."

177
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,

178
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
but it's as if his health is a point in state space

179
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
that you conceptualize as moving.

180
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Or, "The meeting went from three to four,"

181
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.

182
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate

183
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
not only physical force,

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
as in, "Rose forced the door to open,"

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
but also interpersonal force,

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,

187
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
but by issuing a threat.

188
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Or, "Rose forced herself to go,"

189
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,

190
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
engaged in a tug of a war.

191
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive

192
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
of a given event in two different ways,

193
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
such as "cause something to go to someone"

194
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
and "causing someone to have something,"

195
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,820
I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,

196
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
and it's the basis for much human argumentation,

197
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
in which people don't differ so much on the facts

198
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
as on how they ought to be construed.

199
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Just to give you a few examples:

200
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"

201
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"

202
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"

203
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,820
"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."

204
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
And I think the biggest picture of all

205
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
would take seriously the fact

206
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
that so much of our verbiage about abstract events

207
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
is based on a concrete metaphor

208
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
and see human intelligence itself

209
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --

210
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --

211
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,820
which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,

212
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
whose evolution you can well imagine,

213
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
and a process of metaphorical abstraction

214
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
that allows us to bleach these concepts

215
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
of their original conceptual content --

216
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
space, time and force --

217
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
and apply them to new abstract domains,

218
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
therefore allowing a species that evolved

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
to deal with rocks and tools and animals,

220
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law

221
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
and other abstract domains.

222
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature --

223
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,

224
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types

225
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
that govern human social interaction,

226
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
again, as reflected in language.

227
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,820
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."

229
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
And you might remember the scene in which

230
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,

231
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
is asked to show his driver's license

232
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and holds his wallet out

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,820
with a 50-dollar bill extending

234
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
at a slight angle out of the wallet.

235
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
And he says, "I was just thinking

236
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"

237
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
which everyone, including the audience,

238
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
interprets as a veiled bribe.

239
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,820
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.

240
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
For example, in polite requests,

241
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,

242
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
that would be awesome,"

243
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
we know exactly what he means,

244
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
even though that's a rather bizarre

245
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
concept being expressed.

246
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
(Laughter)

247
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"

248
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
I think most people

249
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
understand the intent behind that.

250
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
And likewise, if someone says,

251
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" --

252
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
(Laughter) --

253
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
we understand that as a veiled threat,

254
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.

255
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
So the puzzle is, why are bribes,

256
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?

257
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
No one's fooled.

258
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,

259
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
and the speaker knows the listener knows

260
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,820
that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.

261
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
So what's going on?

262
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
I think the key idea is that language

263
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
is a way of negotiating relationships,

264
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
and human relationships fall into a number of types.

265
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,820
There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,

266
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,

267
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
into communality, which works on the principle

268
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"

269
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,820
the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;

270
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"

271
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"

272
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,820
and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."

273
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Now, relationship types can be negotiated.

274
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Even though there are default situations

275
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
in which one of these mindsets can be applied,

276
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
they can be stretched and extended.

277
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
For example, communality applies most naturally

278
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
within family or friends,

279
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
but it can be used to try to transfer

280
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
the mentality of sharing

281
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,820
to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.

282
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,820
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,

283
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
sororities, locutions like "the family of man,"

284
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
you try to get people who are not related

285
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
to use the relationship type that would ordinarily

286
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
be appropriate to close kin.

287
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type,

288
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.

289
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
If you went over and you helped yourself

290
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
to a shrimp off your boss' plate,

291
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
for example, that would be an awkward situation.

292
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Or if a dinner guest after the meal

293
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,

294
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
that would be rather awkward as well.

295
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
In less blatant cases,

296
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.

297
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
In the workplace, for example,

298
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
there's often a tension over whether an employee

299
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
can socialize with the boss,

300
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
or refer to him or her

301
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
on a first-name basis.

302
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
If two friends have a

303
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,

304
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
it's well known that this can be a source

305
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
of tension or awkwardness.

306
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
In dating, the transition

307
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
from friendship to sex

308
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,

309
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
and as can sex in the workplace,

310
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
in which we call the conflict between a

311
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,820
dominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."

312
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Well, what does this have to do with language?

313
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, language, as a social interaction,

314
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
has to satisfy two conditions.

315
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You have to convey the actual content --

316
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
here we get back to the container metaphor.

317
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,

318
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
the solicitation and so on,

319
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
but you also have to negotiate

320
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
and maintain the kind of relationship

321
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
you have with the other person.

322
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:

323
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
the literal form signals

324
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
the safest relationship with the listener,

325
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
whereas the implicated content --

326
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --

327
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
allows the listener to derive the interpretation

328
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
which is most relevant in context,

329
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
which possibly initiates a changed relationship.

330
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,820
The simplest example of this is in the polite request.

331
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
If you express your request as a conditional --

332
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
"if you could open the window, that would be great" --

333
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
even though the content is an imperative,

334
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
the fact that you're not using the imperative voice

335
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,

336
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.

337
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.

338
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
By expressing it as an if-then statement,

339
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
you can get the message across

340
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,820
without appearing to boss another person around.

341
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
And in a more subtle way, I think, this works

342
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
for all of the veiled speech acts

343
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
involving plausible deniability:

344
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
the bribes, threats, propositions,

345
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
solicitations and so on.

346
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like

347
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
if language -- where it could only be used literally.

348
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
And you can think of it in terms of a

349
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
game-theoretic payoff matrix.

350
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Put yourself in the position of the

351
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.

352
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
There's a high stakes

353
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
in the two possibilities

354
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.

355
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
If you don't bribe the officer,

356
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
then you will get a traffic ticket --

357
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse --

358
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
whether the honest officer

359
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
is honest or dishonest.

360
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

361
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.

362
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,

363
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
if the officer is dishonest,

364
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
you get a huge payoff of going free.

365
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty

366
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
of being arrested for bribery.

367
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
So this is a rather fraught situation.

368
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
On the other hand, with indirect language,

369
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
if you issue a veiled bribe,

370
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
then the dishonest officer

371
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
could interpret it as a bribe,

372
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,820
in which case you get the payoff of going free.

373
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,

374
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.

375
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
So you get the best of both worlds.

376
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
And a similar analysis, I think,

377
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
can apply to the potential awkwardness

378
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
of a sexual solicitation,

379
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.

380
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
I think this affirms

381
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
something that's long been known by diplomats --

382
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
namely, that the vagueness of language,

383
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
far from being a bug or an imperfection,

384
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
actually might be a feature of language,

385
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.

386
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
So to sum up: language is a collective human creation,

387
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
reflecting human nature,

388
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
how we conceptualize reality,

389
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
how we relate to one another.

390
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,820
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,

391
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.

392
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Thank you very much.

393
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
