1
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,778
Looking deeply inside nature,

2
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:18,891
through the magnifying glass of science,

3
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,496
designers extract principles,
processes and materials

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,635
that are forming the very basis
of design methodology.

5
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:32,148
From synthetic constructs
that resemble biological materials,

6
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:35,539
to computational methods
that emulate neural processes,

7
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:38,028
nature is driving design.

8
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,020
Design is also driving nature.

9
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:45,683
In realms of genetics, regenerative
medicine and synthetic biology,

10
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:48,412
designers are growing novel technologies,

11
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:51,513
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,903
Bionics explores the interplay
between biology and design.

13
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:01,822
As you can see, my legs are bionic.

14
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,334
Today, I will tell human stories
of bionic integration;

15
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:14,057
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body

16
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:18,795
are beginning to bridge the gap
between disability and ability,

17
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,628
between human limitation
and human potential.

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,183
Bionics has defined my physicality.

19
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,500
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated

20
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,628
due to tissue damage from frostbite,

21
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:34,904
incurred during
a mountain-climbing accident.

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,357
At that time, I didn't
view my body as broken.

23
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:44,578
I reasoned that a human being
can never be "broken."

24
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,404
Technology is broken.

25
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,562
Technology is inadequate.

26
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:55,916
This simple but powerful idea
was a call to arms,

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,447
to advance technology
for the elimination of my own disability,

28
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,963
and ultimately, the disability of others.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,238
I began by developing specialized limbs

30
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:09,723
that allowed me to return
to the vertical world

31
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:11,214
of rock and ice climbing.

32
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:15,856
I quickly realized that the artificial
part of my body is malleable;

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,230
able to take on any form, any function --

34
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:23,193
a blank slate for which to create,

35
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:28,385
perhaps, structures that could extend
beyond biological capability.

36
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,561
I made my height adjustable.

37
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,265
I could be as short as five feet
or as tall as I'd like.

38
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,718
(Laughter)

39
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:39,092
So when I was feeling bad about myself,

40
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,953
insecure, I would jack my height up.

41
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:42,858
(Laughter)

42
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:45,079
But when I was feeling
confident and suave,

43
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:48,872
I would knock my height down a notch,
just to give the competition a chance.

44
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:50,991
(Laughter)

45
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,118
(Applause)

46
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:56,411
Narrow-edged feet allowed me
to climb steep rock fissures,

47
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:59,037
where the human foot cannot penetrate,

48
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:03,243
and spiked feet enabled me
to climb vertical ice walls,

49
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,140
without ever experiencing
muscle leg fatigue.

50
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,409
Through technological innovation,

51
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,274
I returned to my sport,
stronger and better.

52
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,881
Technology had eliminated my disability,

53
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:17,247
and allowed me a new climbing prowess.

54
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:20,834
As a young man, I imagined a future world
where technology so advanced

55
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:22,640
could rid the world of disability,

56
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:24,760
a world in which neural
implants would allow

57
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,433
the visually impaired to see.

58
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:31,179
A world in which the paralyzed
could walk, via body exoskeletons.

59
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:35,243
Sadly, because of
deficiencies in technology,

60
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:37,001
disability is rampant in the world.

61
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,033
This gentleman is missing three limbs.

62
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:43,546
As a testimony to current technology,
he is out of the wheelchair,

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,491
but we need to do a better job in bionics,
to allow, one day, full rehabilitation

64
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:52,720
for a person with this level of injury.

65
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:57,275
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
the Center for Extreme Bionics.

66
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,847
The mission of the center
is to put forth fundamental science

67
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,707
and technological capability

68
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:07,478
that will allow the biomechatronic
and regenerative repair of humans,

69
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:12,423
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.

70
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:17,264
Today, I'm going to tell you
how my legs function, how they work,

71
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:20,566
as a case in point for this center.

72
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,717
Now, I made sure to shave
my legs last night,

73
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:24,688
because I knew I'd be showing them off.

74
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,161
(Laughter)

75
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:29,415
Bionics entails the engineering
of extreme interfaces.

76
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,311
There's three extreme
interfaces in my bionic limbs:

77
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:36,415
mechanical, how my limbs
are attached to my biological body;

78
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,738
dynamic, how they move
like flesh and bone;

79
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,652
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.

80
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,922
I'll begin with mechanical interface.

81
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,867
In the area of design,
we still do not understand

82
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,767
how to attach devices
to the body mechanically.

83
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,148
It's extraordinary to me
that in this day and age,

84
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,497
one of the most mature,
oldest technologies

85
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:02,917
in the human timeline, the shoe,
still gives us blisters.

86
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,398
How can this be?

87
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:07,374
We have no idea how to attach
things to our bodies.

88
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,089
This is the beautifully
lyrical design work

89
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:13,534
of Professor Neri Oxman
at the MIT Media Lab,

90
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:16,982
showing spatially varying
exoskeletal impedances,

91
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:21,020
shown here by color variation
in this 3D-printed model.

92
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:26,155
Imagine a future where clothing
is stiff and soft where you need it,

93
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:29,709
when you need it, for optimal
support and flexibility,

94
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,408
without ever causing discomfort.

95
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,354
My bionic limbs are attached
to my biological body

96
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:39,440
via synthetic skins
with stiffness variations,

97
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,084
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.

98
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:47,353
To achieve that mirroring, we first
developed a mathematical model

99
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,925
of my biological limb.

100
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,231
To that end, we used
imaging tools such as MRI,

101
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,819
to look inside my body,

102
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:57,548
to figure out the geometries
and locations of various tissues.

103
00:05:57,572 --> 00:05:58,959
We also took robotic tools --

104
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,894
here's a 14-actuator circle
that goes around the biological limb.

105
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,259
The actuators come in,
find the surface of the limb,

106
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,528
measure its unloaded shape,

107
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,203
and then they push on the tissues

108
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:14,798
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.

109
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,609
We combine these imaging and robotic data

110
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:21,275
to build a mathematical description
of my biological limb, shown on the left.

111
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,053
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?

112
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:26,227
At each node, there's a color
that represents tissue compliance.

113
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:30,193
We then do a mathematical transformation
to the design of the synthetic skin,

114
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,416
shown on the right.

115
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,312
And we've discovered optimality is:

116
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:37,193
where the body is stiff,
the synthetic skin should be soft,

117
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:40,677
where the body is soft,
the synthetic skin is stiff,

118
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,984
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.

119
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,301
With this framework,
we've produced bionic limbs

120
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,246
that are the most comfortable
limbs I've ever worn.

121
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:56,986
Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,

122
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,666
will no longer be designed
and manufactured using artisan strategies,

123
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,894
but rather, data-driven
quantitative frameworks.

124
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,122
In that future, our shoes
will no longer give us blisters.

125
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,757
We're also embedding
sensing and smart materials

126
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,352
into the synthetic skins.

127
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:17,844
This is a material developed
by SRI International, California.

128
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,856
Under electrostatic effect,
it changes stiffness.

129
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,494
So under zero voltage,
the material is compliant,

130
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:25,892
it's floppy like paper.

131
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,384
Then the button's pushed,
a voltage is applied,

132
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,400
and it becomes stiff as a board.

133
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,542
(Tapping sounds)

134
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,134
We embed this material
into the synthetic skin

135
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,267
that attaches my bionic limb
to my biological body.

136
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,138
When I walk here, it's no voltage.

137
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,219
My interface is soft and compliant.

138
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:47,234
The button's pushed,
voltage is applied, and it stiffens,

139
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,274
offering me a greater maneuverability
over the bionic limb.

140
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,571
We're also building exoskeletons.

141
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,403
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft

142
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:58,365
in just the right areas
of the running cycle,

143
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,643
to protect the biological joints
from high impacts and degradation.

144
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,453
In the future, we'll all
be wearing exoskeletons

145
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,762
in common activities, such as running.

146
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,270
Next, dynamic interface.

147
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,802
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?

148
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,604
At my MIT lab, we study how humans
with normal physiologies

149
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,134
stand, walk and run.

150
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,549
What are the muscles doing,

151
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,946
and how are they controlled
by the spinal cord?

152
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,962
This basic science
motivates what we build.

153
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,324
We're building bionic ankles,
knees and hips.

154
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:30,864
We're building body parts
from the ground up.

155
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:34,837
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
are called BiOMs.

156
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,815
They've been fitted
to nearly 1,000 patients,

157
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,801
400 of which have been
wounded U.S. soldiers.

158
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:42,983
How does it work?

159
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,022
At heel strike, under computer control,

160
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,022
the system controls stiffness,

161
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,083
to attenuate the shock
of the limb hitting the ground.

162
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:54,203
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
outputs high torques and powers

163
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,582
to lift the person
into the walking stride,

164
00:08:56,606 --> 00:09:00,091
comparable to how muscles
work in the calf region.

165
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,646
This bionic propulsion is very important
clinically to patients.

166
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,724
So on the left, you see
the bionic device worn by a lady,

167
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,683
on the right, a passive device
worn by the same lady,

168
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:13,533
that fails to emulate
normal muscle function,

169
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:17,235
enabling her to do something
everyone should be able to do:

170
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,034
go up and down their steps at home.

171
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:22,469
Bionics also allows
for extraordinary athletic feats.

172
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,612
Here's a gentleman running
up a rocky pathway.

173
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,429
This is Steve Martin --
not the comedian --

174
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:33,432
who lost his legs in a bomb blast
in Afghanistan.

175
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:39,014
We're also building exoskeletal
structures using these same principles,

176
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,281
that wrap around the biological limb.

177
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:47,342
This gentleman does not have
any leg condition, any disability.

178
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:49,622
He has a normal physiology,

179
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:54,215
so these exoskeletons are applying
muscle-like torques and powers,

180
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:57,939
so that his own muscles need not
apply those torques and powers.

181
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,297
This is the first exoskeleton in history
that actually augments human walking.

182
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:07,126
It significantly reduces metabolic cost.

183
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,202
It's so profound in its augmentation,

184
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:13,375
that when a normal, healthy person
wears the device for 40 minutes

185
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,098
and then takes it off,

186
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:19,177
their own biological legs feel
ridiculously heavy and awkward.

187
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:23,270
We're beginning the age in which
machines attached to our bodies

188
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:26,304
will make us stronger
and faster and more efficient.

189
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,266
Moving on to electrical interface:

190
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,447
How do my bionic limbs communicate
with my nervous system?

191
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,313
Across my residual limb are electrodes

192
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:37,082
that measure the electrical
pulse of my muscles.

193
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,025
That's communicated to the bionic limb,

194
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:42,102
so when I think about moving
my phantom limb,

195
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:44,840
the robot tracks those movement desires.

196
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,082
This diagram shows fundamentally
how the bionic limb is controlled.

197
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,895
So we model the missing biological limb,

198
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,733
and we've discovered
what reflexes occurred,

199
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:59,098
how the reflexes of the spinal cord
are controlling the muscles.

200
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:04,019
And that capability is embedded
in the chips of the bionic limb.

201
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,789
What we've done, then, is we modulate
the sensitivity of the reflex,

202
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,908
the modeled spinal reflex,
with the neural signal,

203
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:15,361
so when I relax my muscles
in my residual limb,

204
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,232
I get very little torque and power,

205
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,977
but the more I fire my muscles,
the more torque I get,

206
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,413
and I can even run.

207
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:28,778
And that was the first demonstration
of a running gait under neural command.

208
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:29,954
Feels great.

209
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:35,144
(Applause)

210
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,354
We want to go a step further.

211
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:40,425
We want to actually close the loop

212
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,685
between the human
and the bionic external limb.

213
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:45,378
We're doing experiments

214
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,871
where we're growing nerves,
transected nerves,

215
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,925
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.

216
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,643
On the other side of the channel,

217
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,996
the nerve then attaches to cells,

218
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,928
skin cells and muscle cells.

219
00:11:56,746 --> 00:12:00,866
In the motor channels, we can sense
how the person wishes to move.

220
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,527
That can be sent out wirelessly
to the bionic limb,

221
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,932
then [sensory information]
on the bionic limb

222
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:10,457
can be converted to stimulations
in adjacent channels,

223
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,714
sensory channels.

224
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:15,766
So when this is fully developed
and for human use,

225
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,426
persons like myself will not only have

226
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,983
synthetic limbs that move
like flesh and bone,

227
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,769
but actually feel like flesh and bone.

228
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:27,997
This video shows Lisa Mallette,

229
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:30,672
shortly after being fitted
with two bionic limbs.

230
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,784
Indeed, bionics is making
a profound difference in people's lives.

231
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,561
(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.

232
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,474
(Video) LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!

233
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:43,941
(Video) (Laughter)

234
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,914
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!

235
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:50,651
Woman: Now, don't start running.

236
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:53,469
Man: Now turn around,
and do the same thing walking up,

237
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:57,222
but get on your heel to toe, like you
would normally just walk on level ground.

238
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,072
Try to walk right up the hill.

239
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,334
LM: Oh my God.

240
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,103
Man: Is it pushing you up?

241
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:10,082
LM: Yes! I'm not even --
I can't even describe it.

242
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,619
Man: It's pushing you right up.

243
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:14,976
Hugh Herr: Next week,
I'm visiting the Center --

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,152
Thank you. Thank you.

245
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:19,682
(Applause)

246
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:20,989
Thank you.

247
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:24,838
Next week I'm visiting the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

248
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,465
and I'm going to try to convince CMS

249
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,044
to grant appropriate
code language and pricing,

250
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:33,799
so this technology can be made available
to the patients that need it.

251
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,846
(Applause)

252
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,030
Thank you.

253
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,669
(Applause)

254
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,637
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population

255
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:48,428
suffers from some form of cognitive,
emotional, sensory or motor condition,

256
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,862
and because of poor technology,
too often, conditions result in disability

257
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,521
and a poorer quality of life.

258
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:59,873
Basic levels of physiological function
should be a part of our human rights.

259
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:03,853
Every person should have the right
to live life without disability

260
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,774
if they so choose --

261
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,520
the right to live life
without severe depression;

262
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:11,925
the right to see a loved one,
in the case of seeing-impaired;

263
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,838
or the right to walk or to dance,

264
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:16,619
in the case of limb paralysis
or limb amputation.

265
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:21,119
As a society, we can
achieve these human rights,

266
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:26,637
if we accept the proposition
that humans are not disabled.

267
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,534
A person can never be broken.

268
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,995
Our built environment, our technologies,

269
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,894
are broken and disabled.

270
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:38,296
We the people need not
accept our limitations,

271
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,017
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.

272
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,379
Indeed, through fundamental advances
in bionics in this century,

273
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:50,561
we will set the technological foundation
for an enhanced human experience,

274
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,522
and we will end disability.

275
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,831
I'd like to finish up
with one more story, a beautiful story.

276
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,450
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.

277
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,018
Adrianne lost her left leg
in the Boston terrorist attack.

278
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:08,541
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

279
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,041
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.

280
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:13,678
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.

281
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:16,456
It is her expression. It is her art form.

282
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,479
Naturally, when she lost her limb
in the Boston terrorist attack,

283
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,670
she wanted to return to the dance floor.

284
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,807
After meeting her
and driving home in my car,

285
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:29,684
I thought, I'm an MIT professor.
I have resources.

286
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,246
Let's build her a bionic limb,

287
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,200
to enable her to go back
to her life of dance.

288
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,692
I brought in MIT scientists
with expertise in prosthetics,

289
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,025
robotics, machine learning
and biomechanics,

290
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,884
and over a 200-day research period,
we studied dance.

291
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,106
We brought in dancers
with biological limbs,

292
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,765
and we studied how they move,

293
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,962
what forces they apply on the dance floor,

294
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,513
and we took those data,

295
00:15:56,537 --> 00:16:00,312
and we put forth
fundamental principles of dance,

296
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,123
reflexive dance capability,

297
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:05,312
and we embedded that intelligence
into the bionic limb.

298
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:09,557
Bionics is not only about making
people stronger and faster.

299
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:14,993
Our expression, our humanity
can be embedded into electromechanics.

300
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:21,116
It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts
in the Boston terrorist attack.

301
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:27,116
In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards
took Adrianne off the dance floor.

302
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,846
In 200 days, we put her back.

303
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:35,288
We will not be intimidated, brought down,
diminished, conquered or stopped

304
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:36,857
by acts of violence.

305
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:43,817
(Applause)

306
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:49,168
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me
to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,

307
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:51,422
her first performance since the attack.

308
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,337
She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

309
00:16:54,361 --> 00:17:01,053
(Applause)

310
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:11,514
(Music: "Ring My Bell"
performed by Enrique Iglesias)

311
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:57,857
(Applause)

312
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the research team:

313
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,777
Elliott Rouse

314
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,197
and Nathan Villagaray-Carski.

315
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,983
Elliott and Nathan.

316
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:38,592
(Applause)
