1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,330
I am going to talk about myself,

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,330
which I rarely do, because I --

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,330
well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,330
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

5
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,330
(Laughter)

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,330
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,330
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,330
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,330
So it's actually drearier than self-love;

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,330
it's unrequited self-love.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,330
(Laughter)

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,330
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,330
But I want to, though, explain

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,330
how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,330
because I've been through so many different forms of it.

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,330
I started with improvisation,

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,330
in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,330
which had one rule,

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,330
which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,330
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,330
you could only build on it.

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,330
And of course we live in a society that's all about

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,330
contradicting other peoples' reality.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,330
It's all about contradiction,

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,330
which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,330
I see it everywhere.

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,330
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,330
that in public opinion polls

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,330
the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question

30
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,330
is always two percent.

31
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,330
75 percent of Americans

32
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,330
think Alaska is part of Canada.

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,330
But only two percent don't know the effect

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,330
that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --

35
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,330
(Laughter)

36
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,330
seems a contradiction.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,330
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,330
"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,330
Buying it from us screams good taste."

40
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,330
(Laughter)

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,330
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,

42
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,330
in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.

43
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,330
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,330
(Laughter)

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,330
"Don't use big words."

46
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,330
(Laughter)

47
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,330
"Learn the lingua franca."

48
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,330
(Laughter)

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,330
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."

50
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,330
(Laughter)

51
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,330
And I suppose it's a contradiction that I

52
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,330
talk about science when I don't know math.

53
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,330
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen

54
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,330
for pointing out that one of the reasons,

55
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,330
that there are cultural reasons

56
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,330
that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --

57
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,330
because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,

58
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,330
I was taught to do math and read at the same time.

59
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,330
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,330
and it becomes rapidly obvious

61
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
that there are only two kinds of men in the world:

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,330
dwarves and Prince Charmings.

63
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,330
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.

64
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,330
(Laughter)

65
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,330
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,330
(Laughter)

67
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,330
Of course, by talking about science

68
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,330
I also may, as I did the other night,

69
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,330
incur the violent wrath of some scientists

70
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,330
who were very upset with me.

71
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,330
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,330
And they got very upset.

73
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,330
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,330
in a serious argument.

75
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,330
But I don't engage in serious arguments.

76
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,330
I don't approve of them

77
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,330
because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,

78
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,330
and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.

79
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,330
I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,

80
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,330
like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.

81
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,330
Well rationality is constructed

82
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,330
by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,

83
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,330
that mind-body split, you know?

84
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,330
The head is good, body bad.

85
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,330
Head is ego, body id.

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,330
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,330
"I think therefore I am," --

88
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,330
we mean the head.

89
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,330
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"

90
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,330
"I ain't got no body."

91
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,330
That's how you get rationality.

92
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,330
And that's why so much of humor

93
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,330
is the body asserting itself against the head.

94
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,330
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.

95
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,330
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers

96
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,330
whacking Richard in the genital area.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,330
And we're laughing doubly then

98
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,330
because he's the body, but it's also --

99
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Voice offstage: Richard.

100
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,330
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?

101
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,330
(Laughter)

102
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,330
Richard. Yes but it's also the head,

103
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,330
the head of the conference.

104
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,330
That's the other way that humor --

105
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,330
like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.

106
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,330
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --

107
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,330
(Laughter)

108
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,330
but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.

109
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,330
There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,

110
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,330
which is, as much as we revere the head,

111
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,330
we are very anti-intellectual.

112
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,330
I know this because I read in the New York Times,

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,330
the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,330
after September 11,

115
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,330
in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,

116
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,330
the problem in this country, facing this country

117
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,330
is the university professors and their spawn."

118
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,330
(Laughter)

119
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,330
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

120
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,330
(Laughter)

121
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,330
I don't know how many of you have read it.

122
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,330
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.

123
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,330
(Laughter)

124
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,330
But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.

125
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,330
"The act of a master

126
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,330
taking painful contemptuous possession of her,

127
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,330
was the kind of rapture she wanted.

128
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,330
When they lay together in bed it was,

129
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,330
as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,

130
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,330
an act of violence.

131
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,330
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.

132
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,330
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.

133
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,330
The agony as an act of passion."

134
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,330
So you can imagine my surprise

135
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,330
on reading in The New Yorker

136
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,330
that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

137
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,330
claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.

138
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,330
(Laughter)

139
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,330
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

140
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,330
(Laughter)

141
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,330
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.

142
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,330
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan

143
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,330
in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,

144
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,330
"Whip inflation now."

145
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:18,330
(Laughter)

146
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,330
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand

147
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,330
is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,

148
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,330
which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,

149
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,330
which is objectivity.

150
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,330
Objectivity basically is constructed

151
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,330
in that same S&M way.

152
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,330
It's the subject subjugating the object.

153
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,330
That's how you assert yourself.

154
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,330
You make yourself the active voice.

155
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,330
And the object is the passive no-voice.

156
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,330
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.

157
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,330
I don't know if you know this but --

158
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,330
maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --

159
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,330
but in many hospital nurseries across the country,

160
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,330
until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,

161
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,330
the signs over the little boys cribs read,

162
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,330
"I'm a boy,"

163
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,330
and the signs over the little girls cribs read,

164
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,330
"It's a girl." Yeah.

165
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,330
So the passivity was culturally

166
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,330
projected onto the little girls.

167
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,330
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.

168
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,330
There's a poll that proves --

169
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,330
there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,

170
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,330
in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex

171
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,330
with a woman you actively disliked?"

172
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,330
And well, yeah.

173
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,330
Well, 58 percent said yes,

174
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,330
which I think is overinflated though

175
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,330
because so many men if you just say,

176
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,330
"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"

177
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,330
They don't even wait for the rest of it.

178
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,330
(Laughter)

179
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,330
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --

180
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,330
(Laughter)

181
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,330
That's the first callback,

182
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,330
of my attempted quadruple.

183
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,330
(Laughter)

184
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,330
So this subject-object thing,

185
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,330
is part of something I'm very interested in

186
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:12,330
because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.

187
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,330
I do. I think it can go too far.

188
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,330
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far

189
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,330
with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.

190
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,330
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial

191
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,330
commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."

192
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,330
(Laughter)

193
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,330
Maybe too far. But you know --

194
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,330
I don't think that

195
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,330
a person of color making fun of white people

196
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,330
is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.

197
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,330
Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.

198
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,330
Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.

199
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,330
I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,

200
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,330
which is why you don't see me making fun of

201
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,330
Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.

202
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,330
(Laughter)

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,330
What's funny about being down to four houses?

204
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,330
(Laughter)

205
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,330
And I really learned this lesson

206
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,330
during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,

207
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,330
Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

208
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,330
(Laughter)

209
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,330
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,

210
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,330
and everything else,

211
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,330
were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.

212
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,330
Basically, they were making fun of them for being

213
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,330
trailer trash or white trash.

214
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,330
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice

215
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,330
and that you're not really hurting anybody.

216
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,330
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.

217
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,330
"For sale: White trash compactor."

218
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:51,330
(Laughter)

219
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,330
So this whole subject-object thing

220
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,330
has relevance to humor in this way.

221
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,330
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,

222
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,330
who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.

223
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,330
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."

224
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,330
And she says that Roman humor

225
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,330
mirrors the construction of Roman society.

226
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,330
So that Roman society was very top/bottom,

227
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,330
as ours is to some degree.

228
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,330
And so was humor.

229
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,330
There always had to be the butt of a joke.

230
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,330
So it was always the satirist,

231
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,330
like Juvenal or Martial,

232
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,330
represented the audience,

233
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,330
and he was going to make fun of the outsider,

234
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,330
the person who didn't share that subject status.

235
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,330
And in stand-up of course,

236
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,330
the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.

237
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,330
A lot of heckling is the tension

238
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,330
of trying to make sure that the

239
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,330
comedian is going to be able to dominate,

240
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,330
and overcome the heckler.

241
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,330
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.

242
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,330
But I always hated it because they were

243
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,330
dictating the terms of the interaction,

244
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,330
in the same way that engaging in a serious argument

245
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,330
determines the content, to some degree,

246
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,330
of what you're talking about.

247
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,330
And I was looking for a form

248
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,330
that didn't have that.

249
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:27,330
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.

250
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,330
I know that word is so debased now

251
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,330
by the use of it by Internet marketers.

252
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,330
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.

253
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,330
(Laughter)

254
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,330
I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?

255
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,330
I used to actually hang up on them.

256
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,330
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.

257
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,330
So the next time that one called

258
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,330
I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,

259
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,330
"You sound sexy."

260
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,330
(Laughter)

261
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,330
He hung up on me!

262
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:09,330
(Laughter)

263
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,330
But the interactivity allows the audience

264
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,330
to shape what you're going to do as much as

265
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,330
you shape their experience of the world.

266
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,330
And that's really what I'm looking for.

267
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,330
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze

268
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,330
what exactly it is that I do,

269
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,330
I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.

270
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,330
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.

271
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,330
I mean he had laid it all out.

272
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,330
And then coming to this conference,

273
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,330
I realized that most everybody here

274
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,330
shared those same qualities

275
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,330
because really what trickster is

276
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,330
is an agent of change.

277
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,330
Trickster is a change agent.

278
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,330
And the qualities that I'm about to describe

279
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,330
are the qualities that make it possible

280
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,330
to make change happen.

281
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,330
And one of these is boundary crossing.

282
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,330
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.

283
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,330
But I like to cross boundaries.

284
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,330
I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.

285
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,330
(Phone Ringing)

286
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,330
I hope that's my agent,

287
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,330
because you aren't paying me anything.

288
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
(Laughter)

289
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,330
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about

290
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,330
because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?

291
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,330
I'm able to see the contradiction

292
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,330
that you may not be able to see.

293
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,330
Like for instance a mime once --

294
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,330
or a meme as he called himself.

295
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,330
He was a very selfish meme.

296
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,330
And he said that I had to show more respect

297
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,330
because it took up to 18 years

298
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,330
to learn how to do mime properly.

299
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,330
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."

300
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,330
(Laughter)

301
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,330
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.

302
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,330
(Laughter)

303
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,330
(Applause)

304
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,330
And you know people, this is the problem with

305
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,330
quote, objectivity, unquote.

306
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,330
When you're only surrounded by people

307
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,330
who speak the same vocabulary as you,

308
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,330
or share the same set of assumptions as you,

309
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,330
you start to think that that's reality.

310
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,330
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,

311
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,330
that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.

312
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,330
Well, look at Michael Hawley,

313
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,330
or look at Dean Kamen,

314
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,330
or look at my grandmother.

315
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,330
My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,

316
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,330
whether they wanted her to or not.

317
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,330
(Laughter)

318
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,330
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,

319
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,330
my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

320
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:44,330
(Laughter)

321
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,330
"No, you take the prize.

322
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?

323
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,330
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."

324
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,330
(Laughter)

325
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,330
So that's one -- this boundary crossing,

326
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,330
this go-between which --

327
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,330
Fritz Lanting, is that his name,

328
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,330
actually said that he was a go-between.

329
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,330
That's an actual quality of the trickster.

330
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,330
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.

331
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,330
And this is instead of contradiction.

332
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,330
Where you deny the other person's reality,

333
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,330
you have paradox

334
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,330
where you allow more than one reality to coexist,

335
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,330
I think there's another philosophical construction.

336
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,330
I'm not sure what it's called.

337
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,330
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.

338
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,330
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."

339
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,330
(Laughter)

340
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,330
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

341
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,330
(Laughter)

342
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,330
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.

343
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,330
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up

344
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,330
around five, if that's OK with you.

345
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."

346
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,330
(Laughter)

347
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,330
And another attribute of the trickster

348
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,330
is smart luck.

349
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,330
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,

350
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,330
this is another quality of the trickster.

351
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,330
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.

352
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,330
That, and I will say this to the scientists,

353
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,330
that the trickster has the ability to hold

354
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,330
his ideas lightly

355
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,330
so that he can let room in for new ideas

356
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,330
or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems

357
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,330
with his ideas.

358
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,330
I had no joke for that.

359
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,330
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.

360
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,330
(Laughter)

361
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,330
But here's how I think I like to make change,

362
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,330
and that is in making connections.

363
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,330
This is what I tend to see

364
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,330
almost more than contradictions.

365
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,330
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?

366
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
You know, the toes of the gecko,

367
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,330
curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.

368
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,330
I love connections.

369
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,330
Like I'll read that one of the two attributes

370
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,330
of matter in the Newtonian universe --

371
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,330
there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --

372
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,330
one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.

373
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,330
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,

374
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,330
which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.

375
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,330
(Laughter)

376
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,330
And the other one though is impenetrability.

377
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,330
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability

378
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,330
was the criterion of masculinity.

379
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Masculinity depended on you

380
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,330
being the active penetrator.

381
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,330
And then, in economics, there's an active producer

382
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,330
and a passive consumer,

383
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,330
which explains why business always has to

384
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,330
penetrate new markets.

385
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,330
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China

386
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,330
to open her markets.

387
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,330
And didn't that feel good?

388
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,330
(Laughter)

389
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,330
And now we're being penetrated.

390
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,330
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us

391
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,330
and planting their little flags on our genes.

392
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,330
You know we're being penetrated.

393
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,330
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.

394
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,330
(Laughter)

395
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,330
That's the second of the quadruple.

396
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,330
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.

397
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,330
I still have a way to go.

398
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,330
(Laughter)

399
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,330
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,

400
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,330
is short circuit people's thinking.

401
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,330
You know, make you not follow your usual

402
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,330
train of association,

403
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,330
but make you rewire.

404
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,330
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,

405
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:56,330
it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --

406
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,330
I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.

407
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,330
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like

408
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,330
the woman in that joke about --

409
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,330
have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?

410
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,330
And the mother is elderly.

411
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,330
And the mother goes right through a red light.

412
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,330
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.

413
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,330
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."

414
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,330
And the mother goes through a second red light.

415
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,330
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,

416
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,330
"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"

417
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,330
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"

418
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,330
(Laughter)

419
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,330
And that's the shock of recognition

420
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,330
at the shock of recognition.

421
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,330
That completes the quadruple.

422
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,330
(Laughter)

423
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,330
I just want to say two more things.

424
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,330
One is, another characteristic of trickster

425
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,330
is that the trickster has to

426
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,330
walk this fine line.

427
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,330
He has to have poise.

428
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,330
And you know the biggest hurdle for me,

429
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,330
in doing what I do,

430
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,330
is constructing my performance

431
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,330
so that it's prepared and unprepared.

432
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,330
Finding the balance between those things

433
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,330
is always dangerous

434
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,330
because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.

435
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,330
But being too prepared doesn't leave room

436
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,330
for the accidents to happen.

437
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,330
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie

438
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,330
said yesterday about beauty

439
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,330
because in his book, Hyde says that

440
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,330
sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.

441
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,330
But to do that you have to

442
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,330
lose all the other qualities

443
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,330
because once you're into beauty

444
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,330
you're into a finished thing.

445
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,330
You're into something that

446
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,330
occupies space and inhabits time.

447
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,330
It's an actual thing.

448
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,330
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.

449
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,330
But if you don't do that,

450
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,330
if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,

451
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,330
you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.

452
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:14,330
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.

453
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,330
When you go into beauty the probability wave

454
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,330
collapses into one possibility.

455
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,330
And I like to explore all the possibilities

456
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,330
in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.

457
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,330
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is

458
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,330
that he doesn't have a home.

459
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,330
He's always on the road.

460
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,330
I want to say to you Richard, in closing,

461
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,330
that in TED you've created a home.

462
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,330
And thank you for inviting me into it.

463
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,330
Thank you very much.

464
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,330
(Applause)
