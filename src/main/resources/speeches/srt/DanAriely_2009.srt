1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I want to talk to you today a little bit

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
about predictable irrationality.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
And my interest in irrational behavior

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
started many years ago in the hospital.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I was burned very badly.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,820
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,820
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
and you must have wondered what's the right approach.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,820
you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
which one of those is the right approach?

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,820
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and they would grab hold and they would rip.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
And as you can imagine,

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,820
I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And I would try to reason with them and say,

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,820
"Why don't we try something else?

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Why don't we take it a little longer --

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
And the nurses told me two things.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,820
They told me that they had the right model of the patient --

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
to make suggestions or to interfere or ...

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do,

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
and they kept on doing what they were doing.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
And about three years later, when I left the hospital,

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I started studying at the university.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
was that there is an experimental method

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,820
in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
maybe learn something about the world.

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
So that's what I did.

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I was still interested

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
So originally I didn't have much money,

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,820
so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.

47
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,820
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
and I would crunch it a little bit.

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
(Laughter)

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and pain that went up and pain that went down,

52
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,820
and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,

54
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Or, if you had to choose between the last two,

56
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
which one would you choose?

57
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
(Laughter)

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
I kept on doing this for a while.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
(Laughter)

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --

62
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,820
I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,820
But at the end of this process,

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.

65
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
Here were wonderful people with good intentions

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and plenty of experience, and nevertheless

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,820
they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
It turns out that because we don't encode duration

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
in the way that we encode intensity,

70
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer

71
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
and the intensity was lower.

72
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,

73
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,

74
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
giving me a trend of improvement over time --

75
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
that would have been also less painful.

76
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
And it also turns out that it would have been good

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
All of these would have been great things to do,

79
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
and my nurses had no idea.

80
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
And from that point on I started thinking,

81
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?

83
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
And it turns out it's a more general case --

84
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
there's a lot of mistakes we do.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,820
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,

86
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
and I want to talk to you about cheating.

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,820
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
but also it tells us something, I think,

89
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
about the stock market situation we're in.

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
So, my interest in cheating started

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,

92
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
and I started thinking about what is happening here.

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Is it the case that there was kind of

94
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
a few apples who are capable of doing these things,

95
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
or are we talking a more endemic situation,

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,820
that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.

98
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,820
And here's how it went.

99
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper

100
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,820
with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,

101
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
but I wouldn't give you enough time.

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

103
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."

104
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,820
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --

105
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
on average people would solve four problems.

106
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Other people I would tempt to cheat.

107
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
I would pass their sheet of paper.

108
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
"Please shred the piece of paper.

110
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,

111
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
and tell me how many questions you got correctly."

112
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
People now solved seven questions on average.

113
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
a few people cheated a lot.

115
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Now, in economic theory,

117
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.

118
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
You say, what's the probability of being caught?

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?

120
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?

121
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
And you weigh these options out --

122
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,

123
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
So, we try to test this.

125
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,820
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --

126
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,820
how much money they could steal.

127
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,

128
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.

129
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,820
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,

130
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.

131
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.

132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
What about the probability of being caught?

133
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,

134
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
so there was some evidence left.

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.

136
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,

137
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.

138
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,

139
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.

140
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,

141
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.

142
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
So we said, "If people are not sensitive

143
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,820
to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,

144
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
what could be going on?"

145
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.

146
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror

147
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.

148
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,

149
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
and still feel good about ourselves.

150
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
So, maybe what is happening is that

151
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
there's a level of cheating we can't go over,

152
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,820
but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,

153
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.

154
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
We call this like a personal fudge factor.

155
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?

156
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?

157
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
So, we got people to the lab, and we said,

158
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
"We have two tasks for you today."

159
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
First, we asked half the people

160
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
to recall either 10 books they read in high school,

161
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
or to recall The Ten Commandments,

162
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and then we tempted them with cheating.

163
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --

164
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --

165
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,

166
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.

167
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
It wasn't that the more religious people --

168
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,

169
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
and the less religious people --

170
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --

171
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
cheated more.

172
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,

173
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
they stopped cheating.

174
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists

175
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,820
the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
they don't cheat at all.

177
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard

178
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
to bring into the education system, so we said,

179
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"

180
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
So, we got people to sign,

181
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,820
"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."

182
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.

183
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
And this is particularly interesting,

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
because MIT doesn't have an honor code.

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,820
(Laughter)

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,820
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.

187
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
What about increasing the fudge factor?

188
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT

189
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --

190
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.

191
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
And I came back to measure what we technically call

192
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,820
the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.

194
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,

195
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.

196
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
No bill ever disappeared.

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Now, this is not a good social science experiment,

198
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
so to do it better I did the same experiment

199
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
as I described to you before.

200
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.

201
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,

202
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
they came to us and said,

203
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."

204
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,

205
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
they came to us and said,

206
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,820
"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."

207
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.

208
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,

209
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
and exchanged it for dollars.

210
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Think about the following intuition.

211
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,

212
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
compared to how bad would you feel

213
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?

214
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
These things feel very differently.

215
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds

216
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,820
by being paid by token make a difference?

217
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Our subjects doubled their cheating.

218
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
I'll tell you what I think

219
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
about this and the stock market in a minute.

220
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,820
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,

221
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
because in Enron, there's also a social element.

222
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
People see each other behaving.

223
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
In fact, every day when we open the news

224
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
we see examples of people cheating.

225
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
What does this cause us?

226
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
So, we did another experiment.

227
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,

228
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
and we prepaid them.

229
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,820
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,

230
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
and we told them that at the end, we asked them

231
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,820
to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?

232
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
The same thing happens.

233
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.

234
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.

235
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.

236
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,820
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,

237
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
"I solved everything. What do I do now?"

238
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,820
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.

239
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
That's it. The task is finished."

240
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,820
So, now we had a student -- an acting student --

241
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
that was a part of the group.

242
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Nobody knew it was an actor.

243
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,820
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.

244
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
What would happen to the other people in the group?

245
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?

246
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Here is what happens.

247
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,820
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.

248
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Here is the thing.

249
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.

250
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,

251
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.

252
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment

253
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
were Carnegie Mellon students.

254
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --

255
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --

256
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,820
but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.

257
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,820
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,

258
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
cheating went down.

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
(Laughter)

260
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
Now, this is important, because remember,

261
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
when the moment the student stood up,

262
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,

263
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
because the experimenter said,

264
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.

265
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.

266
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
It was about the norms for cheating.

267
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,

268
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.

269
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --

270
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
I mean, not terrible in this --

271
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,

272
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
from another university, another group,

273
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --

274
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --

275
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,820
and people cheat even less.

276
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?

277
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.

278
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
They cheat just by a little bit.

279
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.

280
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
When we get bigger distance from cheating,

281
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.

282
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
And when we see cheating around us,

283
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.

284
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,

285
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
think about what happens.

286
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
What happens in a situation when you create something

287
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
where you pay people a lot of money

288
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
to see reality in a slightly distorted way?

289
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Would they not be able to see it this way?

290
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Of course they would.

291
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
What happens when you do other things,

292
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
like you remove things from money?

293
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,

294
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
mortgage-backed securities.

295
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Could it be that with those more distant things,

296
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
it's not a token for one second,

297
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
it's something that is many steps removed from money

298
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?

299
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
And what happens to the social environment

300
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
when people see other people behave around them?

301
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way

302
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
in the stock market.

303
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
More generally, I want to tell you something

304
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
about behavioral economics.

305
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
We have many intuitions in our life,

306
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.

307
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?

308
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition

309
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
in our private life, in our business life,

310
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
and most particularly when it goes to policy,

311
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,

312
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --

313
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
taxation, health care and so on.

314
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
And the difficulty of testing our intuition

315
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
was the big lesson I learned

316
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.

317
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
So I went back to talk to them

318
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.

319
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
And I learned two interesting things.

320
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,

321
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,820
told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.

322
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.

323
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
But think about me as a nurse,

324
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,

325
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.

326
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."

327
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,820
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.

328
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,

329
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,820
"I did not think that your intuition was right.

330
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
I felt my intuition was correct."

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
So, if you think about all of your intuitions,

332
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,820
it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.

333
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --

334
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
she thought her intuition was right --

335
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,820
it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment

336
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
to try and check whether she was wrong.

337
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.

338
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --

339
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
our own ability, how the economy works,

340
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
how we should pay school teachers.

341
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
But unless we start testing those intuitions,

342
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
we're not going to do better.

343
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
And just think about how better my life would have been

344
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,

345
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
and how everything would have been better

346
