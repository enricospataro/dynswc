1
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,903
Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,

2
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:16,989
the future of the Internet.

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:20,372
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

4
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:23,198
the man behind those revelations,

5
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:25,574
Ed Snowden.

6
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:29,141
(Applause)

7
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:33,394
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

8
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:36,169
controlling this bot from his laptop,

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,222
so he can see what the bot can see.

10
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:42,170
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,781
What can you see, as a matter of fact?

12
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,519
Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.

13
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,769
This is amazing.

14
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,982
(Laughter)

15
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:56,265
CA: Ed, some questions for you.

16
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,558
You've been called many things

17
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,123
in the last few months.

18
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:04,048
You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,

19
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:05,777
a hero.

20
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:09,594
What words would you describe yourself with?

21
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:12,256
ES: You know, everybody who is involved

22
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:13,752
with this debate

23
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,494
has been struggling over me and my personality

24
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,543
and how to describe me.

25
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,232
But when I think about it,

26
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:24,661
this isn't the question that
we should be struggling with.

27
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,828
Who I am really doesn't matter at all.

28
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:30,540
If I'm the worst person in the world,

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,497
you can hate me and move on.

30
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:35,032
What really matters here are the issues.

31
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,867
What really matters here is the
kind of government we want,

32
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,380
the kind of Internet we want,

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,938
the kind of relationship between people

34
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,278
and societies.

35
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:46,366
And that's what I'm hoping
the debate will move towards,

36
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,738
and we've seen that increasing over time.

37
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:50,648
If I had to describe myself,

38
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:51,992
I wouldn't use words like "hero."

39
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:54,694
I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."

40
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:56,888
I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,

41
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,452
just like everyone else.

42
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,325
CA: So just to give some context

43
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:03,521
for those who don't know the whole story --

44
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:07,251
(Applause) —

45
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:11,814
this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii

46
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,204
working as a consultant to the NSA.

47
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:16,248
As a sysadmin, you had access

48
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,653
to their systems,

49
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,907
and you began revealing
certain classified documents

50
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:26,107
to some handpicked journalists

51
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,698
leading the way to June's revelations.

52
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:33,074
Now, what propelled you to do this?

53
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,860
ES: You know,

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,040
when I was sitting in Hawaii,

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,698
and the years before, when I was
working in the intelligence community,

56
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:44,420
I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.

57
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,697
We do a lot of good things
in the intelligence community,

58
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:48,890
things that need to be done,

59
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,587
and things that help everyone.

60
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,544
But there are also things that go too far.

61
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:54,840
There are things that shouldn't be done,

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,908
and decisions that were being made in secret

63
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,156
without the public's awareness,

64
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,668
without the public's consent,

65
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,520
and without even our representatives in government

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,153
having knowledge of these programs.

67
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:12,686
When I really came to struggle with these issues,

68
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,308
I thought to myself,

69
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:17,394
how can I do this in the most responsible way,

70
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:20,402
that maximizes the public benefit

71
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:23,113
while minimizing the risks?

72
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:26,201
And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,

73
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,443
out of going to Congress,

74
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:29,746
when there were no laws,

75
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,431
there were no legal protections

76
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,198
for a private employee,

77
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,531
a contractor in intelligence like myself,

78
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:40,178
there was a risk that I would be
buried along with the information

79
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,085
and the public would never find out.

80
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:45,107
But the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution

81
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:48,648
guarantees us a free press for a reason,

82
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,853
and that's to enable an adversarial press,

83
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,750
to challenge the government,

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,384
but also to work together with the government,

85
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:58,702
to have a dialogue and debate about how we can

86
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:04,141
inform the public about matters of vital importance

87
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:07,271
without putting our national security at risk.

88
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,947
And by working with journalists,

89
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:11,101
by giving all of my information

90
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,378
back to the American people,

91
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,149
rather than trusting myself to make

92
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:17,883
the decisions about publication,

93
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,119
we've had a robust debate

94
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,386
with a deep investment by the government

95
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:28,492
that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.

96
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:32,267
And the risks that have been threatened,

97
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,400
the risks that have been played up

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,952
by the government

99
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,378
have never materialized.

100
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,456
We've never seen any evidence

101
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:43,012
of even a single instance of specific harm,

102
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,481
and because of that,

103
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,608
I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.

104
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,821
CA: So let me show the audience

105
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,290
a couple of examples of what you revealed.

106
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,202
If we could have a slide up, and Ed,

107
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,957
I don't know whether you can see,

108
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,071
the slides are here.

109
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,656
This is a slide of the PRISM program,

110
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:01,125
and maybe you could tell the audience

111
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,731
what that was that was revealed.

112
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,943
ES: The best way to understand PRISM,

113
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:07,404
because there's been a little bit of controversy,

114
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:11,155
is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.

115
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:13,910
Much of the debate in the U.S.
has been about metadata.

116
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,801
They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,

117
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,542
and they're talking about a specific legal authority

118
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,247
called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

119
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:25,316
That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,

120
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,679
mass surveillance of the entire country's

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,836
phone records, things like that --

122
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,198
who you're talking to,

123
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,226
when you're talking to them,

124
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:34,522
where you traveled.

125
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:37,023
These are all metadata events.

126
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:40,369
PRISM is about content.

127
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,509
It's a program through which the government could

128
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,553
compel corporate America,

129
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,946
it could deputize corporate America

130
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:51,810
to do its dirty work for the NSA.

131
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,806
And even though some of
these companies did resist,

132
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:56,229
even though some of them --

133
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:57,475
I believe Yahoo was one of them —

134
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:00,132
challenged them in court, they all lost,

135
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:03,047
because it was never tried by an open court.

136
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:06,178
They were only tried by a secret court.

137
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,545
And something that we've seen,

138
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:10,249
something about the PRISM program
that's very concerning to me is,

139
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:12,228
there's been a talking point in the U.S. government

140
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:15,979
where they've said 15 federal judges

141
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,677
have reviewed these programs
and found them to be lawful,

142
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,397
but what they don't tell you

143
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:24,027
is those are secret judges

144
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:26,029
in a secret court

145
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,103
based on secret interpretations of law

146
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:33,337
that's considered 34,000 warrant requests

147
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:35,796
over 33 years,

148
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,983
and in 33 years only rejected

149
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,866
11 government requests.

150
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,613
These aren't the people that we want deciding

151
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,759
what the role of corporate America

152
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,215
in a free and open Internet should be.

153
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,326
CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here

154
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,538
shows the dates in which

155
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,953
different technology companies, Internet companies,

156
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,307
are alleged to have joined the program,

157
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,265
and where data collection began from them.

158
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:05,014
Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.

159
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:10,118
How was that data collected by the NSA?

160
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:13,297
ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides

161
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:16,097
refer to it as direct access.

162
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:18,847
What that means to an actual NSA analyst,

163
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,955
someone like me who was working
as an intelligence analyst

164
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:24,426
targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,

165
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,508
things like that, in Hawaii,

166
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,477
is the provenance of that data

167
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,733
is directly from their servers.

168
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,797
It doesn't mean

169
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:35,603
that there's a group of company representatives

170
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:38,040
sitting in a smoky room with the NSA

171
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,830
palling around and making back-room deals

172
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,373
about how they're going to give this stuff away.

173
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,766
Now each company handles it different ways.

174
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:45,942
Some are responsible.

175
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,033
Some are somewhat less responsible.

176
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,801
But the bottom line is, when we talk about

177
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:53,180
how this information is given,

178
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,666
it's coming from the companies themselves.

179
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,961
It's not stolen from the lines.

180
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,893
But there's an important thing to remember here:

181
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,824
even though companies pushed back,

182
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:03,877
even though companies demanded,

183
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,423
hey, let's do this through a warrant process,

184
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:08,197
let's do this

185
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,346
where we actually have some sort of legal review,

186
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,177
some sort of basis for handing over

187
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,117
these users' data,

188
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,508
we saw stories in the Washington Post last year

189
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,720
that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story

190
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,319
that said the NSA broke in

191
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,120
to the data center communications

192
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,276
between Google to itself

193
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,854
and Yahoo to itself.

194
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:31,686
So even these companies that are cooperating

195
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,557
in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner

196
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,430
with the NSA,

197
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,726
the NSA isn't satisfied with that,

198
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,704
and because of that, we need our companies

199
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,519
to work very hard

200
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,991
to guarantee that they're going to represent

201
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,577
the interests of the user, and also advocate

202
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,493
for the rights of the users.

203
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:52,767
And I think over the last year,

204
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,350
we've seen the companies that are named

205
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,768
on the PRISM slides

206
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,577
take great strides to do that,

207
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,830
and I encourage them to continue.

208
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,512
CA: What more should they do?

209
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:06,029
ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company

210
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,255
in America can do today, right now,

211
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,697
without consulting with lawyers,

212
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:14,236
to protect the rights of users worldwide,

213
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:19,619
is to enable SSL web encryption

214
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,624
on every page you visit.

215
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:24,566
The reason this matters is today,

216
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:29,804
if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,

217
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,251
the NSA can see a record of that,

218
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,470
the Russian intelligence service
can see a record of that,

219
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,927
the Chinese service can see a record of that,

220
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,825
the French service, the German service,

221
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,147
the services of Andorra.

222
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:43,425
They can all see it because it's unencrypted.

223
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:47,025
The world's library is Amazon.com,

224
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,680
but not only do they not
support encryption by default,

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,846
you cannot choose to use encryption

226
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,573
when browsing through books.

227
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,282
This is something that we need to change,

228
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,157
not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,

229
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,649
but they're a great example.

230
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,317
All companies need to move

231
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:03,710
to an encrypted browsing habit by default

232
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,194
for all users who haven't taken any action

233
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:08,455
or picked any special methods on their own.

234
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,766
That'll increase the privacy and the rights

235
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,531
that people enjoy worldwide.

236
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,009
CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.

237
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,962
I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)

238
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,670
This is a program called Boundless Informant.

239
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,346
What is that?

240
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:25,526
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA

241
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,969
for using appropriate names on this.

242
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:31,814
This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.

243
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,284
Boundless Informant

244
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:36,134
is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.

245
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,543
The NSA was previously asked by Congress,

246
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:40,756
was there any ability that they had

247
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:44,514
to even give a rough ballpark estimate

248
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,700
of the amount of American communications

249
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,834
that were being intercepted.

250
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,865
They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,

251
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,414
and we can't track those stats.

252
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,518
We can't tell you how many communications

253
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,981
we're intercepting around the world,

254
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,468
because to tell you that would be

255
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,775
to invade your privacy.

256
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,990
Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,

257
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,125
but the reality, when you look at this slide is,

258
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,778
not only do they have the capability,

259
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,394
the capability already exists.

260
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:13,068
It's already in place.

261
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:16,216
The NSA has its own internal data format

262
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:20,365
that tracks both ends of a communication,

263
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:21,647
and if it says,

264
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,673
this communication came from America,

265
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,029
they can tell Congress how
many of those communications

266
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,545
they have today, right now.

267
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:31,516
And what Boundless Informant tells us

268
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,242
is more communications are being intercepted

269
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:37,215
in America about Americans

270
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:40,635
than there are in Russia about Russians.

271
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency

272
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,819
should be aiming for.

273
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,225
CA: Ed, there was a story broken
in the Washington Post,

274
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,947
again from your data.

275
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,626
The headline says,

276
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,123
"NSA broke privacy rules

277
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:54,153
thousands of times per year."

278
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:55,691
Tell us about that.

279
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,284
ES: We also heard in Congressional
testimony last year,

280
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,221
it was an amazing thing for someone like me

281
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,925
who came from the NSA

282
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:04,497
and who's seen the actual internal documents,

283
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:07,088
knows what's in them,

284
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:09,628
to see officials testifying under oath

285
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,510
that there had been no abuses,

286
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,143
that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,

287
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:18,084
when we knew this story was coming.

288
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,172
But what's especially interesting about this,

289
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,220
about the fact that the NSA has violated

290
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,588
their own rules, their own laws

291
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,261
thousands of times in a single year,

292
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,988
including one event by itself,

293
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:34,964
one event out of those 2,776,

294
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,270
that affected more than 3,000 people.

295
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,109
In another event, they intercepted

296
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:43,321
all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.

297
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:45,558
What's amazing about this,

298
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,766
this report, that didn't get that much attention,

299
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:52,627
is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,

300
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,768
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,

301
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:58,755
Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report

302
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:01,946
until the Washington Post contacted her

303
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,394
asking for comment on the report.

304
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,287
And she then requested a copy from the NSA

305
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,988
and received it,

306
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,015
but had never seen this before that.

307
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,702
What does that say about the state of oversight

308
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,439
in American intelligence

309
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,227
when the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee

310
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:19,020
has no idea that the rules are being broken

311
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,180
thousands of times every year?

312
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,809
CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:

313
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,474
Why should we care about

314
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,942
all this surveillance, honestly?

315
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,094
I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,

316
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,878
you've got nothing to worry about.

317
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:36,170
What's wrong with that point of view?

318
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,818
ES: Well, so the first thing is,

319
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,531
you're giving up your rights.

320
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:40,889
You're saying hey, you know,

321
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,261
I don't think I'm going to need them,

322
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,943
so I'm just going to trust that, you know,

323
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:47,921
let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,

324
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,895
these guys are going to do the right thing.

325
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,754
Your rights matter

326
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,596
because you never know when
you're going to need them.

327
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:56,878
Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,

328
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,010
not just in America,

329
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,601
but in Western societies

330
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:03,563
and in democratic societies around the world.

331
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:05,967
People should be able to pick up the phone

332
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,421
and to call their family,

333
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,420
people should be able to send a text message

334
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,548
to their loved ones,

335
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:13,002
people should be able to buy a book online,

336
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,792
they should be able to travel by train,

337
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,009
they should be able to buy an airline ticket

338
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,746
without wondering about how these events

339
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:22,431
are going to look to an agent of the government,

340
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:25,021
possibly not even your government

341
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:26,776
years in the future,

342
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:28,516
how they're going to be misinterpreted

343
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,300
and what they're going to think your intentions were.

344
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,374
We have a right to privacy.

345
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,992
We require warrants to be based on probable cause

346
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,456
or some kind of individualized suspicion

347
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:43,983
because we recognize that trusting anybody,

348
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,577
any government authority,

349
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,661
with the entirety of human communications

350
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:51,094
in secret and without oversight

351
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:55,938
is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.

352
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,497
CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.

353
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,336
I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney

354
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:07,228
who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,

355
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:10,650
Edward Snowden is the lion
that bit the head off the dog.

356
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,203
He thinks you've committed

357
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,495
one of the worst acts of betrayal

358
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,601
in American history.

359
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:20,957
What would you say to people who think that?

360
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,000
ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.

361
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,797
(Laughter) (Applause)

362
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:37,198
Thank you. (Laughter)

363
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,674
I think it's amazing, because at the time

364
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:43,449
Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,

365
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:44,885
Dick Cheney was saying

366
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:47,315
he was going to end governments worldwide,

367
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,220
the skies were going to ignite

368
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,356
and the seas were going to boil off,

369
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:54,574
and now he's saying it's a flea bite.

370
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,087
So we should be suspicious about the same sort of

371
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:01,280
overblown claims of damage to national security

372
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,965
from these kind of officials.

373
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:09,814
But let's assume that these
people really believe this.

374
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:12,044
I would argue that they have kind of

375
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:16,414
a narrow conception of national security.

376
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,630
The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney

377
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,642
do not keep the nation safe.

378
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:26,675
The public interest is not always the same

379
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:29,110
as the national interest.

380
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,004
Going to war with people who are not our enemy

381
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,134
in places that are not a threat

382
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:37,301
doesn't make us safe,

383
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,468
and that applies whether it's in Iraq

384
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,235
or on the Internet.

385
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,758
The Internet is not the enemy.

386
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,783
Our economy is not the enemy.

387
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:47,069
American businesses, Chinese businesses,

388
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,640
and any other company out there

389
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,071
is a part of our society.

390
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,285
It's a part of our interconnected world.

391
00:16:56,285 --> 00:17:00,730
There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,

392
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,398
and if we destroy these bonds

393
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,553
by undermining the standards, the security,

394
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:09,410
the manner of behavior,

395
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,361
that nations and citizens all around the world

396
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:14,738
expect us to abide by.

397
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:18,440
CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen

398
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,339
1.7 million documents.

399
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,166
It seems only a few hundred of them

400
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,023
have been shared with journalists so far.

401
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:28,068
Are there more revelations to come?

402
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:30,510
ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.

403
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,311
I don't think there's any question

404
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:37,558
that some of the most important reporting

405
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,298
to be done is yet to come.

406
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,360
CA: Come here, because I want to ask you

407
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,887
about this particular revelation.

408
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,909
Come and take a look at this.

409
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:52,157
I mean, this is a story which I think
for a lot of the techies in this room

410
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,896
is the single most shocking thing

411
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:56,256
that they have heard in the last few months.

412
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:58,881
It's about a program called "Bullrun."

413
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:02,657
Can you explain what that is?

414
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,365
ES: So Bullrun, and this is again

415
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:11,462
where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,

416
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:16,052
this is a program named after a Civil War battle.

417
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,665
The British counterpart is called Edgehill,

418
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:19,140
which is a U.K. civil war battle.

419
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,347
And the reason that I believe they're named this way

420
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,836
is because they target our own infrastructure.

421
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,527
They're programs through which the NSA

422
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:31,742
intentionally misleads corporate partners.

423
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,624
They tell corporate partners that these

424
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:35,299
are safe standards.

425
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,318
They say hey, we need to work with you

426
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:40,971
to secure your systems,

427
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:44,164
but in reality, they're giving bad advice

428
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,430
to these companies that makes them

429
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,725
degrade the security of their services.

430
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,054
They're building in backdoors that not only

431
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,412
the NSA can exploit,

432
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,933
but anyone else who has time and money

433
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,053
to research and find it

434
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,187
can then use to let themselves in

435
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,057
to the world's communications.

436
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,827
And this is really dangerous,

437
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:07,011
because if we lose a single standard,

438
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:10,070
if we lose the trust of something like SSL,

439
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,552
which was specifically targeted

440
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,675
by the Bullrun program,

441
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,343
we will live a less safe world overall.

442
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:18,450
We won't be able to access our banks

443
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,703
and we won't be able to access commerce

444
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,526
without worrying about people
monitoring those communications

445
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,704
or subverting them for their own ends.

446
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:32,773
CA: And do those same decisions also potentially

447
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:35,759
open America up to cyberattacks

448
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,675
from other sources?

449
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,140
ES: Absolutely.

450
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,872
One of the problems,

451
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:46,322
one of the dangerous legacies

452
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:49,814
that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,

453
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:54,051
is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.

454
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:55,977
They've been in charge of offensive operations,

455
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,098
that is hacking,

456
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,808
but they've also been in
charge of defensive operations,

457
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,171
and traditionally they've always prioritized

458
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,558
defense over offense

459
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:04,948
based on the principle

460
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,764
that American secrets are simply worth more.

461
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,874
If we hack a Chinese business

462
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,558
and steal their secrets,

463
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,641
if we hack a government office in Berlin

464
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,739
and steal their secrets,

465
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,346
that has less value to the American people

466
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:21,446
than making sure that the Chinese

467
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:23,952
can't get access to our secrets.

468
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:28,083
So by reducing the security of our communications,

469
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,111
they're not only putting the world at risk,

470
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,383
they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,

471
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,054
because intellectual property is the basis,

472
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,981
the foundation of our economy,

473
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:39,239
and if we put that at risk through weak security,

474
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,868
we're going to be paying for it for years.

475
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,415
CA: But they've made a calculation

476
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,606
that it was worth doing this

477
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:48,145
as part of America's defense against terrorism.

478
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:51,757
Surely that makes it a price worth paying.

479
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:55,644
ES: Well, when you look at the results

480
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,951
of these programs in stopping terrorism,

481
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:01,701
you will see that that's unfounded,

482
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,620
and you don't have to take my word for it,

483
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,392
because we've had the first open court,

484
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,761
the first federal court that's reviewed this,

485
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:12,557
outside the secrecy arrangement,

486
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:14,544
called these programs Orwellian

487
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:16,778
and likely unconstitutional.

488
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:19,517
Congress, who has access

489
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:20,828
to be briefed on these things,

490
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,810
and now has the desire to be,

491
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,217
has produced bills to reform it,

492
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:29,102
and two independent White House panels

493
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:31,192
who reviewed all of the classified evidence

494
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,825
said these programs have never stopped

495
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,586
a single terrorist attack

496
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,089
that was imminent in the United States.

497
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,275
So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?

498
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,606
Do these programs have any value at all?

499
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,850
I say no, and all three branches

500
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,282
of the American government say no as well.

501
00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:51,095
CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation

502
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:54,380
for them than the war against terrorism?

503
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,930
ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?

504
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,930
CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation

505
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,809
for them other than the war against terrorism?

506
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,504
ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism

507
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,705
has always been what we in the intelligence world

508
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,978
would call a cover for action.

509
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,903
Terrorism is something that provokes

510
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:15,133
an emotional response that allows people

511
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:19,490
to rationalize authorizing powers and programs

512
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,934
that they wouldn't give otherwise.

513
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,420
The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,

514
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,137
the NSA asked for these authorities

515
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,074
back in the 1990s.

516
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:31,064
They asked the FBI to go to
Congress and make the case.

517
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,238
The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.

518
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:35,803
But Congress and the American people said no.

519
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,214
They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.

520
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:40,133
They said it's worth too much damage

521
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,820
to our society to justify the gains.

522
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,095
But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,

523
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:50,346
they used secrecy and they
used the justification of terrorism

524
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,280
to start these programs in secret

525
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,092
without asking Congress,

526
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:56,272
without asking the American people,

527
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:59,010
and it's that kind of government behind closed doors

528
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,569
that we need to guard ourselves against,

529
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:02,819
because it makes us less safe,

530
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,711
and it offers no value.

531
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,577
CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,

532
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,759
because I've got a more personal question for you.

533
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,683
Speaking of terror,

534
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:15,640
most people would find the
situation you're in right now

535
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,936
in Russia pretty terrifying.

536
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:22,523
You obviously heard what happened,

537
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,716
what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,

538
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,997
Chelsea Manning as now is,

539
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:29,484
and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that

540
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,142
there are people in the intelligence community

541
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,421
who want you dead.

542
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,361
How are you coping with this?

543
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,310
How are you coping with the fear?

544
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,314
ES: It's no mystery

545
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:45,962
that there are governments out
there that want to see me dead.

546
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:49,372
I've made clear again and again and again

547
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:52,738
that I go to sleep every morning

548
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:57,298
thinking about what I can
do for the American people.

549
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:00,330
I don't want to harm my government.

550
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,593
I want to help my government,

551
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:07,401
but the fact that they are willing to

552
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,721
completely ignore due process,

553
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,429
they're willing to declare guilt

554
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,715
without ever seeing a trial,

555
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,131
these are things that we need to work against

556
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:21,709
as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.

557
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,536
We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.

558
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:26,550
We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.

559
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,869
And whatever part I can do to see that end,

560
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,022
I'm happy to do despite the risks.

561
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,546
CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback

562
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:35,765
from the audience here,

563
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,869
because I know there's widely differing reactions

564
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,810
to Edward Snowden.

565
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,098
Suppose you had the following two choices, right?

566
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,904
You could view what he did

567
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,798
as fundamentally a reckless act

568
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,017
that has endangered America

569
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:53,580
or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act

570
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,055
that will work towards America and the world's

571
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,442
long-term good?

572
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:01,760
Those are the two choices I'll give you.

573
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,915
I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with

574
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:05,332
the first of those,

575
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:08,741
that this was a reckless act?

576
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,396
There are some hands going up.

577
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:11,780
Some hands going up.

578
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,056
It's hard to put your hand up

579
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:15,167
when the man is standing right here,

580
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,732
but I see them.

581
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:19,263
ES: I can see you. (Laughter)

582
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:21,524
CA: And who goes with the second choice,

583
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,407
the fundamentally heroic act?

584
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:26,054
(Applause) (Cheers)

585
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:28,628
And I think it's true to say that
there are a lot of people

586
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,853
who didn't show a hand and I think

587
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,563
are still thinking this through,

588
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:36,021
because it seems to me that the debate around you

589
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:39,130
doesn't split along traditional political lines.

590
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,384
It's not left or right, it's not really about

591
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:45,506
pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.

592
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:48,219
Part of it is almost a generational issue.

593
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:50,027
You're part of a generation that grew up

594
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:52,953
with the Internet, and it seems as if

595
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:56,161
you become offended at almost a visceral level

596
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:57,457
when you see something done

597
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,519
that you think will harm the Internet.

598
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,092
Is there some truth to that?

599
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:08,140
ES: It is. I think it's very true.

600
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,238
This is not a left or right issue.

601
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,815
Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,

602
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,362
I don't just mean Americans,

603
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:17,375
I mean people around the world,

604
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,721
it's not a partisan issue.

605
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,760
These are things that all people believe,

606
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,285
and it's up to all of us to protect them,

607
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:27,117
and to people who have seen and enjoyed

608
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,778
a free and open Internet,

609
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:32,004
it's up to us to preserve that liberty

610
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,909
for the next generation to enjoy,

611
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,774
and if we don't change things,

612
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:38,907
if we don't stand up to make the changes

613
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:42,114
we need to do to keep the Internet safe,

614
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,882
not just for us but for everyone,

615
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:46,347
we're going to lose that,

616
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,600
and that would be a tremendous loss,

617
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,947
not just for us, but for the world.

618
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:52,020
CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently

619
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,868
from the founder of the world wide web,

620
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:58,385
who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

621
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,089
Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,

622
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,960
do we have a microphone for Tim?

623
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,327
(Applause)

624
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:12,402
Tim, good to see you. Come up there.

625
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:14,839
Which camp are you in, by the way,

626
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,339
traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but --

627
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,033
Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer

628
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:24,088
answers to that question, but hero,

629
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:27,490
if I have to make the choice between the two.

630
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,823
CA: And Ed, I think you've read

631
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,907
the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about

632
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:35,875
about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.

633
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,977
Is that something that makes sense?

634
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:41,618
ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up

635
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,677
not just thinking about the Internet,

636
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,041
but I grew up in the Internet,

637
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:50,701
and although I never expected to have the chance

638
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:56,248
to defend it in such a direct and practical manner

639
00:27:56,248 --> 00:28:00,044
and to embody it in this unusual,

640
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,173
almost avatar manner,

641
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,879
I think there's something poetic about the fact that

642
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:06,861
one of the sons of the Internet

643
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:09,913
has actually become close to the Internet

644
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:12,399
as a result of their political expression.

645
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,110
And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet

646
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,072
is exactly what we need.

647
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:21,580
We need to encode our values

648
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,927
not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,

649
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:27,167
and it's something that I hope,

650
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,690
I invite everyone in the audience,

651
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,940
not just here in Vancouver but around the world,

652
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,296
to join and participate in.

653
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,610
CA: Do you have a question for Ed?

654
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,640
TBL: Well, two questions,

655
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,764
a general question —

656
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,559
CA: Ed, can you still hear us?

657
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,075
ES: Yes, I can hear you.
CA: Oh, he's back.

658
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:47,670
TBL: The wiretap on your line

659
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,576
got a little interfered with for a moment.

660
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,229
(Laughter)

661
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,431
ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.

662
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:57,238
TBL: So, from the 25 years,

663
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:00,175
stepping back and thinking,

664
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,921
what would you think would be

665
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,528
the best that we could achieve

666
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:06,388
from all the discussions that we have

667
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:09,281
about the web we want?

668
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,653
ES: When we think about

669
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:15,766
in terms of how far we can go,

670
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,919
I think that's a question that's really only limited

671
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,456
by what we're willing to put into it.

672
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:23,413
I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past

673
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:28,971
has been exactly what we as not just a nation

674
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:32,310
but as a people around the world need,

675
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,536
and by cooperating, by engaging not just

676
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,940
the technical parts of society,

677
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,782
but as you said, the users,

678
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,846
the people around the world who contribute

679
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,288
through the Internet, through social media,

680
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:47,015
who just check the weather,

681
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:49,568
who rely on it every day as a part of their life,

682
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:52,508
to champion that.

683
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:55,045
We'll get not just the Internet we've had,

684
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,994
but a better Internet, a better now,

685
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:02,037
something that we can use to build a future

686
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:05,005
that'll be better not just than what we hoped for

687
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,390
but anything that we could have imagined.

688
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,852
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.

689
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,857
A lot of the conversation since then has been

690
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,911
along the lines that

691
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:18,814
actually George Orwell got it wrong.

692
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,533
It's not Big Brother watching us.

693
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,147
We, through the power of the web,

694
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:24,511
and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.

695
00:30:24,511 --> 00:30:26,772
Your revelations kind of drove a stake

696
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:30,519
through the heart of that rather optimistic view,

697
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,939
but you still believe there's a way of doing something

698
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:35,808
about that.

699
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,548
And you do too.

700
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:43,716
ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made

701
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,313
that the powers of Big Brother
have increased enormously.

702
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:51,642
There was a recent legal article at Yale

703
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:55,373
that established something called
the Bankston-Soltani Principle,

704
00:30:55,373 --> 00:31:00,602
which is that our expectation of privacy is violated

705
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:02,471
when the capabilities of government surveillance

706
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:05,666
have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,

707
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,388
and each time that occurs, we need to revisit

708
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,441
and rebalance our privacy rights.

709
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,431
Now, that hasn't happened since

710
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:15,529
the government's surveillance powers

711
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:18,309
have increased by several orders of magnitude,

712
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,283
and that's why we're in the
problem that we're in today,

713
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:25,095
but there is still hope,

714
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:27,231
because the power of individuals

715
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:29,838
have also been increased by technology.

716
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:31,839
I am living proof

717
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,001
that an individual can go head to head

718
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:36,319
against the most powerful adversaries

719
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,640
and the most powerful intelligence agencies

720
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,400
around the world and win,

721
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,060
and I think that's something

722
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,483
that we need to take hope from,

723
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:47,660
and we need to build on

724
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,097
to make it accessible not just to technical experts

725
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:52,614
but to ordinary citizens around the world.

726
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,281
Journalism is not a crime,

727
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,071
communication is not a crime,

728
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:59,015
and we should not be monitored
in our everyday activities.

729
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,744
CA: I'm not quite sure how
you shake the hand of a bot,

730
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:07,634
but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.
TBL: That'll come very soon.

731
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,757
ES: Nice to meet you,

732
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:10,804
and I hope my beam looks as nice

733
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,148
as my view of you guys does.

734
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:15,868
CA: Thank you, Tim.

735
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:21,600
(Applause)

736
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,652
I mean, The New York Times
recently called for an amnesty for you.

737
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,878
Would you welcome the chance
to come back to America?

738
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:33,763
ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,

739
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:36,345
the principles that have been the foundation

740
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:38,738
of this project

741
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:42,818
have been the public interest

742
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:45,761
and the principles that underly

743
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:49,037
the journalistic establishment in the United States

744
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:51,483
and around the world,

745
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:56,328
and I think if the press is now saying,

746
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,410
we support this,

747
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,498
this is something that needed to happen,

748
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:03,142
that's a powerful argument,
but it's not the final argument,

749
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,855
and I think that's something
that public should decide.

750
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,697
But at the same time,

751
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,243
the government has hinted that they want

752
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:11,087
some kind of deal,

753
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,201
that they want me to compromise

754
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,376
the journalists with which I've been working,

755
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,809
to come back,

756
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:19,362
and I want to make it very clear

757
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:22,088
that I did not do this to be safe.

758
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:24,356
I did this to do what was right,

759
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:26,583
and I'm not going to stop my work

760
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,957
in the public interest

761
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:30,746
just to benefit myself.

762
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:36,524
(Applause)

763
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:38,443
CA: In the meantime,

764
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:42,211
courtesy of the Internet and this technology,

765
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:43,861
you're here, back in North America,

766
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:47,877
not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.

767
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:52,771
I'm curious, how does that feel?

768
00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:54,909
ES: Canada is different than what I expected.

769
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,034
It's a lot warmer.

770
00:33:57,034 --> 00:34:02,741
(Laughter)

771
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,997
CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."

772
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:08,195
If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,

773
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:10,410
what is your idea worth spreading

774
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,485
right now at this moment?

775
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,135
ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder

776
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:21,738
that democracy may die behind closed doors,

777
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,642
but we as individuals are born

778
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:26,291
behind those same closed doors,

779
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,656
and we don't have to give up

780
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:31,889
our privacy to have good government.

781
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,979
We don't have to give up our liberty

782
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,758
to have security.

783
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:38,546
And I think by working together

784
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:40,871
we can have both open government

785
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,808
and private lives,

786
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:44,581
and I look forward to working with everyone

787
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:47,120
around the world to see that happen.

788
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,458
Thank you very much.

789
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,698
CA: Ed, thank you.

790
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:59,527
(Applause)
