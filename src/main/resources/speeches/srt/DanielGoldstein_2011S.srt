1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Do you remember the story

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
of Odysseus and the Sirens

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
from high school or junior high school?

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
after the Trojan War.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
And he's standing on the deck of his ship,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
he's talking to his first mate,

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
and he's saying,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
and on those rocks sit some beautiful women

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
called Sirens.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
And these women sing an enchanting song,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
a song so alluring

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
that all sailors who hear it

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
crash into the rocks and die."

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Now you would expect, given that,

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
but instead Odysseus says,

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
"I want to hear that song.

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And so what I'm going to do

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
is I'm going to pour wax in the ears

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
of you and all the men --

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
stay with me --

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
so that you can't hear the song,

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
so that I can listen

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and we can all sail by unaffected."

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
So this is a captain

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk

30
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
so that he can hear a song.

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
And I'd like to think if this was the case,

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,820
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
All right, so tie me to the mast."

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
And the first mate takes a rope

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
And Odysseus does his best job playacting

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
and says, "Untie me. Untie me.

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
I want to hear that song. Untie me."

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
And the first mate wisely resists

43
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and doesn't untie Odysseus.

44
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And the first mate hesitates.

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
or should I untie him?"

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
And the first mate thinks,

50
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."

51
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.

52
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
He's like, "You idiot. You moron.

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,

54
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
every single one of the men will be dead.

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Now just don't untie me no matter what."

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
He throws the first mate to the ground.

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
This repeats itself through the night --

58
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
rehearsal, tying to the mast,

59
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
conning his way out of it,

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Hilarity ensues.

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Tying yourself to a mast

63
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
is perhaps the oldest written example

64
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
of what psychologists call a commitment device.

65
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,820
A commitment device is a decision that you make

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
with a cool head to bind yourself

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
so that you don't do something regrettable

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
when you have a hot head.

69
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Because there's two heads inside one person

70
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
when you think about it.

71
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
when it comes to questions of temptation.

73
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
There is first, the present self.

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
He just wants to get to the front row.

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.

77
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
But then there's this other self, the future self.

78
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
This is Odysseus as an old man

79
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
with his wife Penelope

81
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
outside of Ithaca -- the other one.

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,820
So why do we need commitment devices?

83
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Well resisting temptation is hard,

84
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
as the 19th century English economist

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Nassau William Senior said,

86
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,

87
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
or to seek distant rather than immediate results,

88
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
are among the most painful exertions

89
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
of the human will."

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,

91
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
you probably realize

92
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
it's not that your goals are physically impossible

93
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
that's keeping you from achieving them,

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.

95
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
It's physically possible to lose weight.

96
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
It's physically possible to exercise more.

97
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
But resisting temptation

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
is hard.

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
The other reason

100
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
that it's difficult to resist temptation

101
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
is because it's an unequal battle

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
between the present self and the future self.

103
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
It's in control. It's in power right now.

105
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
It has these strong, heroic arms

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
And the future self is not even around.

108
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
It's off in the future. It's weak.

109
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
It doesn't even have a lawyer present.

110
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
There's nobody to stick up for the future self.

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And so the present self can trounce

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
all over its dreams.

113
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,

114
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
and we need commitment devices

115
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
to level the playing field between the two.

116
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.

117
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones

118
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,820
such as locking a credit card away with a key

119
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
or unplugging your Internet connection

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
so you can use your computer.

122
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I was creating commitment devices of my own

123
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
long before I knew what they were.

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
So when I was a starving post-doc

125
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
at Columbia University,

126
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.

127
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
I had to write five pages a day

128
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
towards papers

129
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
or I would have to give up five dollars.

130
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
And when you try to execute these commitment devices,

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
you realize the devil is really in the details.

132
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.

133
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,820
I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.

134
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity

135
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
or give it to my wife or something like that.

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
So then I would kind of justify not writing

139
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
by giving a gift.

140
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,

141
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.

142
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,

143
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
and so that wouldn't work.

144
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
So ultimately, I just decided

145
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.

146
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
Sometimes a good person would find it,

147
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
sometimes a bad person would find it.

148
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money

149
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
that I would regret.

150
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
(Laughter)

151
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Such it is with commitment devices.

152
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,820
But despite my like for them,

153
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
there's two nagging concerns

154
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
that I've always had about commitment devices,

155
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
and you might feel this if you use them yourself.

156
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
So the first is,

157
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
when you've got one of these devices going,

158
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
such as this contract to write everyday or pay,

159
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
it's just a constant reminder

160
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
that you have no self-control.

161
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,

162
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."

163
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And then when you're ever in a situation

164
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,820
where you don't have a commitment device in place --

165
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,

166
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
and I have no defense mechanism," --

167
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
you just eat it.

168
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.

169
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.

170
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

171
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
The other problem with commitment devices

172
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
is that you can always weasel your way out of them.

173
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,

174
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,

175
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.

176
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
And so there's no way that this is going to work."

177
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate

178
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
in one person.

179
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,

180
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
and you're weaseling your way out of it,

181
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
and then you're beating yourself up afterwards.

182
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
So I've been working

183
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
for about a decade now

184
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
on finding other ways

185
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
to change people's relationship to the future self

186
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
without using commitment devices.

187
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship

188
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
to the future financial self.

189
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
And this is a timely issue.

190
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
I'm talking about the topic of saving.

191
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Now saving is a classic two selves problem.

192
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
The present self does not want to save at all.

193
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
It wants to consume.

194
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.

195
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
So this is a timely problem.

196
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
We look at the savings rate

197
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
and it has been declining since the 1950s.

198
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,

199
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
has been increasing.

201
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
And we're at a situation now

202
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
where for every three baby boomers,

203
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
the McKinsey Global Institute predicts

204
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,820
that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs

205
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
while they're in retirement.

206
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
So what can we do about this?

207
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,

208
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.

209
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
He said that, "We might neglect our future selves

210
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,820
because of some failure of belief or imagination."

211
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
That is to say,

212
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,

213
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
or we might not be able to imagine

214
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
that we're going to get old some day.

215
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.

216
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Of course, we know that we're going to get old.

217
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?

218
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
So my coauthors and I have used computers,

219
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
the greatest tool of our time,

220
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
to assist people's imagination

221
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
and help them imagine what it might be like

222
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
to go into the future.

223
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And I'll show you some of these tools right here.

224
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
The first is called the distribution builder.

225
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
It shows people what the future might be like

226
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes

227
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
that might be obtained in the future.

228
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,

229
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
and each sits on a row

230
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
that represents a level of wealth and retirement.

231
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Being up at the top

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.

233
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Being down at the bottom

234
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
means that you're struggling to make ends meet.

235
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
When you make an investment,

236
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
what you're really saying is, "I accept

237
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
that any one of these 100 things

238
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
could happen to me and determine my wealth."

239
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Now you can try to move your outcomes around.

240
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,

241
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
but it costs you something to do it.

242
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
It means that you have to save more today.

243
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Once you find an investment that you're happy with,

244
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
what people do is they click "done"

245
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
and the markers begin to disappear,

246
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
slowly, one by one.

247
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
It simulates what it is like to invest in something

248
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
and to watch that investment pan out.

249
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
At the end, there will only be one marker left standing

250
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
and it will determine our wealth in retirement.

251
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Yes, this person retired

252
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,820
at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.

253
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
They're making more money while retired

254
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
than they were making while they were working.

255
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
If you're like most people,

256
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --

257
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
just to think about making

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,820
50 percent more money in retirement than before.

259
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
However, had you ended up on the very bottom,

260
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
it might have given you a slight sense

261
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
of dread and/or nausea

262
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,820
thinking about struggling to get by in retirement.

263
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
By using this tool over and over

264
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
and simulating outcome after outcome,

265
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
people can understand

266
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
that the investments and savings that they undertake today

267
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
determine their well-being in the future.

268
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Now people are motivated through emotions,

269
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
but different people find different things motivating.

270
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
This is a simulation

271
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
that uses graphics,

272
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
but other people find motivating what money can buy,

273
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
not just numbers.

274
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
So here I made a distribution builder

275
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
where instead of showing numerical outcomes,

276
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
I show people what those outcomes will get you,

277
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
in particular apartments that you can afford

278
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,

279
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,820
2,000 dollars per month and so on.

280
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
As you move down the ladder of apartments,

281
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
you see that they get worse and worse.

282
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.

283
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,820
And as you get to the very bottom,

284
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
you're faced with the unfortunate reality

285
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
that if you don't save anything for retirement,

286
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,820
you won't be able to afford any housing at all.

287
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments

288
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
renting for that amount

289
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
as advertised on the Internet.

290
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
The last thing I'll show you,

291
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
the last behavioral time machine,

292
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,

293
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,

294
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Bill Sharpe.

295
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
And what it is

296
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
is an exploration into virtual reality.

297
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
So what we do is we take pictures of people --

298
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
in this case, college-age people --

299
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
and we use software to age them

300
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
and show these people what they'll look like

301
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.

302
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
And we try to test

303
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
whether actually assisting your imagination

304
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
by looking at the face of your future self

305
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
can change you investment behavior.

306
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
So this is one of our experiments.

307
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.

308
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
He's given a control

309
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
that allows him to adjust his savings rate.

310
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
As he moves his savings rate down,

311
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
it means that he's saving zero

312
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
when it's all the way here at the left.

313
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
You can see his current annual income --

314
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --

315
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
is quite high, 91 percent,

316
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
but his retirement income is quite low.

317
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
He's going to retire on 44 percent

318
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
of what he earned while he was working.

319
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
If he saves the maximum legal amount,

320
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
his retirement income goes up,

321
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
but he's unhappy

322
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.

323
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Other conditions show people the future self.

324
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.

325
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
If you save very little,

326
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
the future self is unhappy

327
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
living on 44 percent of the income.

328
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Whereas if the present self saves a lot,

329
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
the future self is delighted,

330
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
where the income is close up near 100 percent.

331
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
To bring this to a wider audience,

332
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
I've been working with Hal and Allianz

333
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
to create something we call the behavioral time machine,

334
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,

335
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions

336
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
to different levels of retirement wealth.

337
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
So for instance,

338
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
here is somebody using the tool.

339
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
And just watch the facial expressions

340
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
as they move the slider.

341
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.

342
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
The older face is miserable.

343
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.

344
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
And then it's a high savings rate.

345
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
The younger face is getting unhappy.

346
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
The older face is quite pleased

347
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
with the decision.

348
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.

349
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
And what's nice about it

350
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
is it's not something that biasing people actually,

351
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
because as one face smiles,

352
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
the other face frowns.

353
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
It's not telling you which way to put the slider,

354
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
it's just reminding you that you are

355
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
connected to and legally tied to

356
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
this future self.

357
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.

358
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
And that's something that's easy to forget.

359
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
This use of virtual reality

360
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
is not just good for making people look older.

361
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
There are programs you can get

362
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
to see how people might look

363
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,

364
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
if they gain weight and so on.

365
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
And what's good is,

366
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,

367
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
you don't have to program these by yourself

368
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
in order to see the virtual reality.

369
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars

370
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
that do the same thing.

371
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.

372
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
You might recognize him from the previous demos.

373
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
And just for kicks we ran his picture

374
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
through the balding, aging and weight gain software

375
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
to see how he would look.

376
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself

377
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
to disabuse you of that last image.

378
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
And I'll close it there.

379
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
On behalf of Hal and myself,

380
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
I wish all the best to your present and future selves.

381
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Thank you.

382
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
(Applause)
