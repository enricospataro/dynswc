1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Something called the Danish Twin Study

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
established that only about 10 percent

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
of how long the average person lives,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,820
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
optimal lifestyle of longevity

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
we can come up with a de facto formula

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
for longevity.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
You have the USDA food pyramid.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
There is what Oprah tells us.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
around what really helps us live longer better.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Should you eat organic meats

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
or should you be eating tofu?

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
How about these hormones or resveratrol?

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
And does purpose play into it?

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Well, our approach to finding longevity

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
was to team up with National Geographic,

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
and the National Institute on Aging,

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
to find the four demographically confirmed areas

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
that are geographically defined.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
And then bring a team of experts in there

31
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,820
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.

34
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
when it comes to longevity.

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,820
And the first myth is if you try really hard

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
you can live to be 100.

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
False.

39
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
in America live to be 100.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
Your chances are very low.

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
it's hard to reach 100.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
The problem is

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,820
that we're not programmed for longevity.

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
We are programmed for something called

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
procreative success.

48
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
I love that word.

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
It reminds me of my college days.

50
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
Biologists term procreative success to mean

51
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
the age where you have children

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
After that the effect of evolution

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
completely dissipates.

55
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat

56
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,820
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
the genetic lottery.

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
The second myth is,

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
there are treatments that can help slow,

62
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
reverse, or even stop aging.

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
False.

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
those brain cells die, they never come back.

67
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,

68
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
the cartilage never comes back.

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,

70
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and we can get Alzheimer's.

71
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
There is just too many things to go wrong.

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,820
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,

73
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
(Laughter)

75
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.

76
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
And every time they turn themselves over

77
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.

78
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
And it builds up exponentially.

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
It's a little bit like the days when we all had

80
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Beatles albums or Eagles albums

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,

82
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
and pretty soon, with successive generations

84
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
that tape sounds like garbage.

85
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Well, the same things happen to our cells.

86
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
That's why a 65-year-old person

87
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
is aging at a rate of about

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
125 times faster

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
than a 12-year-old person.

90
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
So, if there is nothing you can do

91
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
to slow your aging or stop your aging,

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
what am I doing here?

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Well, the fact of the matter is

94
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,820
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,

95
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
my body, your body,

96
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
is about 90 years,

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
a little bit more for women.

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
But life expectancy in this country

99
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
is only 78.

100
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
So somewhere along the line,

101
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,820
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.

102
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
These are years that we could get.

103
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,820
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,

104
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

105
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
We think the best way to get these missing years

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
is to look at the cultures around the world

107
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
that are actually experiencing them,

108
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
areas where people are living to age 100

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,

110
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
areas where the life expectancy

111
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
is an extra dozen years,

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction

113
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
of what it is in this country.

114
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles

115
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,

117
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.

118
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
And here we have this area where men live the longest,

119
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.

120
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,

121
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
they do so with extraordinary vigor.

122
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,

123
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,820
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.

124
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
(Laughter)

125
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.

126
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.

127
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Because the land is so infertile,

128
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
they largely are shepherds,

129
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.

130
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Their diet is mostly plant-based,

131
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.

132
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread

133
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,

134
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals

135
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,820
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,

137
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
and a type of wine that has three times the level

138
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.

139
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
It's called Cannonau.

140
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
But the real secret I think lies more

141
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
in the way that they organize their society.

142
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,820
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society

143
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
is how they treat older people.

144
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
You ever notice here in America, social equity

145
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
seems to peak at about age 24?

146
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Just look at the advertisements.

147
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Here in Sardinia, the older you get

148
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
the more equity you have,

149
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.

150
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
You go into the bars in Sardinia,

151
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,

152
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,820
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,820
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
to keep them close to the family --

155
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --

156
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,

157
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
That's called the grandmother effect.

159
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
We found our second Blue Zone

160
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
on the other side of the planet,

161
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,

162
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
on the archipelago of Okinawa.

163
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.

164
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
And in the northern part of the main island,

165
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
this is ground zero for world longevity.

166
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,820
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.

167
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free

168
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
life expectancy in the world.

169
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
They have what we want.

170
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,

171
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
very quickly,

172
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,820
and often, I can tell you, after sex.

173
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.

174
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.

175
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
big killers here in America.

177
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.

178
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers

179
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.

180
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
What do they do?

181
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Once again, a plant-based diet,

182
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.

183
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
And they eat about eight times as much tofu

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
as Americans do.

185
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,820
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.

186
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
They have all kinds of little strategies

187
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
to keep from overeating,

188
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.

189
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
A few of the strategies we observed:

190
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.

191
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Instead of serving family style,

192
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,

193
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
they serve at the counter, put the food away,

194
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and then bring it to the table.

195
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,

196
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.

197
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
It was invented by Confucius.

198
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.

199
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal

200
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.

201
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling

202
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
to travel from your belly to your brain.

203
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent

204
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.

205
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs

206
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
that we can associate with longevity.

207
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
We know that isolation kills.

208
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.

209
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
We're down to one and half right now.

210
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,

211
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
you were born into a system where you

212
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
automatically have a half a dozen friends

213
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
with whom you travel through life.

214
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai

215
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,820
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,

216
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
and if things go bad,

217
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
child gets sick, parent dies,

218
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
you always have somebody who has your back.

219
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
This particular Moai, these five ladies

220
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
have been together for 97 years.

221
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Their average age is 102.

222
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Typically in America

223
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.

224
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
There is our work life,

225
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
where we're productive.

226
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
And then one day, boom, we retire.

227
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
And typically that has meant

228
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
retiring to the easy chair,

229
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
or going down to Arizona to play golf.

230
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
In the Okinawan language there is not even

231
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
a word for retirement.

232
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Instead there is one word

233
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
that imbues your entire life,

234
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
and that word is "ikigai."

235
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
And, roughly translated, it means

236
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,820
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."

237
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
For this 102-year-old karate master,

238
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.

239
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
For this hundred-year-old fisherman

240
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.

241
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging

242
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,820
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.

243
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,

244
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
the people who put the questionnaire.

245
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"

246
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.

247
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai

248
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,820
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.

249
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.

250
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And I asked her what it felt like

251
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.

252
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
And she put her head back and she said,

253
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
"It feels like leaping into heaven."

254
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
I thought that was a wonderful thought.

255
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
My editor at Geographic

256
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.

257
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,

258
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.

259
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
But that's because all the young people left.

260
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
(Laughter)

261
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
So, we turned to the data again.

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
And we found America's longest-lived population

263
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
among the Seventh-Day Adventists

264
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,820
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.

265
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Adventists are conservative Methodists.

266
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
They celebrate their Sabbath

267
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.

268
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,820
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.

269
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
And they follow five little habits

270
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,

271
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
comparatively speaking.

272
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
In America here, life expectancy

273
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
for the average woman is 80.

274
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
But for an Adventist woman,

275
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,820
their life expectancy is 89.

276
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,

277
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
who are expected to live about 11 years

278
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
longer than their American counterparts.

279
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Now, this is a study that followed

280
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
about 70,000 people for 30 years.

281
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates

282
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
the premise of this Blue Zone project.

283
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
This is a heterogeneous community.

284
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.

285
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
The only thing that they have in common are a set of

286
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
very small lifestyle habits

287
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
that they follow ritualistically

288
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
for most of their lives.

289
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
They take their diet directly from the Bible.

290
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],

291
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
where God talks about legumes and seeds,

292
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
and on one more stanza about green plants,

293
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
ostensibly missing is meat.

294
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.

295
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
For 24 hours every week,

296
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,

297
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
where the kids need to be driven,

298
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
they stop everything and they focus on their God,

299
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,

300
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
are nature walks.

301
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,

302
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,820
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.

303
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.

304
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.

305
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
So, if you go to an Adventist's party

306
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.

307
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,

308
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.

309
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,820
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.

310
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.

311
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.

312
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
He's a multimillionaire,

313
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars

314
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
to build a privacy fence,

315
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."

316
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and hauling poles around.

318
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day

319
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,820
he ended up in the operating room.

320
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
But not as the guy on the table;

321
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,820
the guy doing open-heart surgery.

322
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,820
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.

323
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,

324
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.

325
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,

326
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
throw up rooster tails.

327
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
And then Marge Deton.

328
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Marge is 104.

329
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.

330
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
She starts her day with lifting weights.

331
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
She rides her bicycle.

332
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
And then she gets in her root-beer colored

333
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
1994 Cadillac Seville,

334
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,

335
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,820
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.

336
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.

337
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet

338
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
who rode his bicycle across

339
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.

340
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing

341
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,820
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.

342
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,820
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.

343
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
So, what are the common denominators

344
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
in these three cultures?

345
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
What are the things that they all do?

346
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
And we managed to boil it down to nine.

347
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,820
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this

348
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
and these common denominators hold true.

349
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
And the first one,

350
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,

351
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
none of them exercise,

352
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
at least the way we think of exercise.

353
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Instead, they set up their lives

354
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.

355
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
These 100-year-old Okinawan women

356
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,

357
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
30 or 40 times a day.

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.

359
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Every trip to the store, or to church

360
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.

361
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
They don't have any conveniences.

362
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.

363
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.

364
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
That's physical activity.

365
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.

366
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
When they do do intentional physical activity,

367
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,

368
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,

369
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
and they all tend to have a garden.

370
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
They know how to set up their life in the right way

371
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
so they have the right outlook.

372
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.

373
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.

374
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.

375
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,

376
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,

377
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's

378
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
disease to cardiovascular disease.

379
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day

380
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
you turn that inflammatory state

381
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,820
into a more anti-inflammatory state.

382
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,

383
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
ikigai, like the Okinawans.

384
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
You know the two most dangerous years in your life

385
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,

386
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
and the year you retire.

387
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
These people know their sense of purpose,

388
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years

389
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
of extra life expectancy.

390
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
There's no longevity diet.

391
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,

392
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
not a hard sell to the American population.

393
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
(Laughter)

394
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.

395
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.

396
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,820
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,

397
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.

398
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.

399
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
They put their families first,

400
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
take care of their children and their aging parents.

401
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,820
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,

402
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
which is worth between four and 14

403
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
extra years of life expectancy

404
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
if you do it four times a month.

405
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
And the biggest thing here

406
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
is they also belong to the right tribe.

407
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
They were either born into

408
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,820
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.

409
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
We know from the Framingham studies,

410
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
that if your three best friends are obese

411
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.

412
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,

413
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.

414
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation

415
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,

416
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
biking or gardening,

417
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,820
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,

418
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,

419
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.

420
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world

421
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.

422
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Exercise programs usually start in January;

423
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
they're usually done by October.

424
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
When it comes to longevity

425
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
there is no short term fix

426
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,820
in a pill or anything else.

427
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
But when you think about it,

428
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
your friends are long-term adventures,

429
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do

430
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
to add more years to your life,

431
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
and life to your years. Thank you very much.

432
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,820
(Applause)
