1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Everybody talks about happiness these days.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,820
I had somebody count the number of books

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
among researchers.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
Everybody would like to make people happier.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,820
But in spite of all this flood of work,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
there are several cognitive traps

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
about happiness.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,820
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
The first of these traps

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
It turns out that the word "happiness"

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
is just not a useful word anymore,

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
because we apply it to too many different things.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
but by and large,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
this is something that we'll have to give up

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,820
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
of what well-being is.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,820
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
and being happy about your life

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
or happy with your life.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
And those are two very different concepts,

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
And the third is the focusing illusion,

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
that affects well-being

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
without distorting its importance.

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.

38
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
There's just no way of getting it right.

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Now, I'd like to start with an example

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,820
after one of my lectures reported a story,

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,820
and that was a story --

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and it was absolutely glorious music

45
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
and at the very end of the recording,

46
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
there was a dreadful screeching sound.

47
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
And then he added, really quite emotionally,

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,820
it ruined the whole experience.

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
But it hadn't.

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
He had had the experience.

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.

53
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
They counted for nothing

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,820
because he was left with a memory;

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
the memory was ruined,

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

57
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
What this is telling us, really,

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

59
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
in terms of two selves.

60
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
There is an experiencing self,

61
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
who lives in the present

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
and knows the present,

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
is capable of re-living the past,

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
but basically it has only the present.

65
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

66
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
you know, when the doctor asks,

67
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,820
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
And then there is a remembering self,

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,820
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
and maintains the story of our life,

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
and it's the one that the doctor approaches

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
in asking the question,

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
"How have you been feeling lately?"

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.

75
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Those are two very different entities,

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
the experiencing self and the remembering self,

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,820
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
about the notion of happiness.

79
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
Now, the remembering self

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
is a storyteller.

81
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

82
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
it starts immediately.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

84
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Our memory tells us stories,

85
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
is a story.

87
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,820
And let me begin with one example.

88
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
This is an old study.

89
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,820
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

92
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

93
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Here are two patients,

94
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
those are their recordings.

95
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

96
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
And it's a very easy question.

97
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

98
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
his colonoscopy was longer,

99
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

100
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Patient B had, and more.

101
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
But now there is another question:

102
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
And here is a surprise.

104
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
The surprise is that Patient A

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
than Patient B.

107
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

109
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,820
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.

112
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
And the one that is worse

113
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,820
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
it's a bad story.

115
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
How do we know that?

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
and much later, too,

118
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,820
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.

120
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
Now this is a direct conflict

121
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

122
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

123
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
clearly, B had a worse time.

124
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

125
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

126
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
and it has been done, and it does work --

127
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,820
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A

128
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.

129
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
That will cause the patient

130
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
to suffer, but just a little

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
and much less than before.

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

133
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
you have made the experiencing self

134
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
of Patient A worse off,

135
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

136
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
a lot better off,

137
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
because now you have endowed Patient A

138
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
with a better story

139
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
about his experience.

140
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
What defines a story?

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
And that is true of the stories

142
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
that memory delivers for us,

143
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.

144
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
What defines a story are changes,

145
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
significant moments and endings.

146
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Endings are very, very important

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,820
and, in this case, the ending dominated.

148
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Now, the experiencing self

149
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
lives its life continuously.

150
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
It has moments of experience, one after the other.

151
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?

152
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
And the answer is really straightforward:

153
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
They are lost forever.

154
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

155
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

156
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
is said to be about three seconds long;

157
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
that means that, you know,

158
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

159
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

160
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
most of them don't leave a trace.

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Most of them are completely ignored

162
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
by the remembering self.

163
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
And yet, somehow you get the sense

164
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
that they should count,

165
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
that what happens during these moments of experience

166
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
is our life.

167
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
It's the finite resource that we're spending

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
while we're on this earth.

169
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
And how to spend it

170
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
would seem to be relevant,

171
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
but that is not the story

172
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
that the remembering self keeps for us.

173
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
So we have the remembering self

174
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
and the experiencing self,

175
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
and they're really quite distinct.

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
The biggest difference between them

177
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
is in the handling of time.

178
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

179
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
if you have a vacation,

180
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
and the second week is just as good as the first,

181
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
then the two-week vacation

182
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

185
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
is barely better than the one-week vacation

186
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
because there are no new memories added.

187
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
You have not changed the story.

188
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
And in this way,

189
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
time is actually the critical variable

190
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
that distinguishes a remembering self

191
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
from an experiencing self;

192
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
time has very little impact on the story.

193
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Now, the remembering self does more

194
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
than remember and tell stories.

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,820
It is actually the one that makes decisions

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,

197
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons

198
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
and is deciding which of them to choose,

199
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
then the one that chooses

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,820
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,

201
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
The experiencing self

203
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
has no voice in this choice.

204
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
We actually don't choose between experiences,

205
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
we choose between memories of experiences.

206
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
And even when we think about the future,

207
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

208
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
We think of our future

209
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
as anticipated memories.

210
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
And basically you can look at this,

211
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,

212
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and you can think of the remembering self

213
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
sort of dragging the experiencing self

214
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
through experiences that

215
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
the experiencing self doesn't need.

216
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
I have that sense that

217
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
when we go on vacations

218
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
this is very frequently the case;

219
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
that is, we go on vacations,

220
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
to a very large extent,

221
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
in the service of our remembering self.

222
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.

223
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

224
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
That is one of the explanations

225
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
that is given for the dominance

226
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
of the remembering self.

227
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

228
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

229
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

230
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
and I think of it relatively often,

231
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

232
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And I probably have consumed

233
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,

234
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

235
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

236
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
with the 600 pictures in it,

237
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I would have spent another hour.

238
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Now, that is three weeks,

239
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
and that is at most an hour and a half.

240
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
There seems to be a discrepancy.

241
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

242
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

243
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
but even if you do more of this,

244
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
there is a genuine question:

245
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Why do we put so much weight on memory

246
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

247
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
So I want you to think

248
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
about a thought experiment.

249
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Imagine that for your next vacation,

250
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
you know that at the end of the vacation

251
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
all your pictures will be destroyed,

252
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
and you'll get an amnesic drug

253
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
so that you won't remember anything.

254
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)

255
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,820
And if you would choose a different vacation,

256
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
there is a conflict between your two selves,

257
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,

258
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
and it's actually not at all obvious, because

259
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
if you think in terms of time,

260
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
then you get one answer,

261
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
and if you think in terms of memories,

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
you might get another answer.

263
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Why do we pick the vacations we do

264
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
is a problem that confronts us

265
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
with a choice between the two selves.

266
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Now, the two selves

267
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
bring up two notions of happiness.

268
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
There are really two concepts of happiness

269
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
that we can apply, one per self.

270
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,820
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

271
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

272
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
in the experiencing self's life?

273
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
And they're all -- happiness for moments

274
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
is a fairly complicated process.

275
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
What are the emotions that can be measured?

276
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And, by the way, now we are capable

277
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
of getting a pretty good idea

278
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

279
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

280
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
it's a completely different thing.

281
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
This is not about how happily a person lives.

282
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is

283
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,820
when that person thinks about her life.

284
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Very different notion.

285
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions

286
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
is going to mess up the study of happiness,

287
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,

288
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time

289
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
in precisely this way.

290
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
The distinction between the

291
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
happiness of the experiencing self

292
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
and the satisfaction of the remembering self

293
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
has been recognized in recent years,

294
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.

295
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
The Gallup Organization has a world poll

296
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
where more than half a million people

297
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
have been asked questions

298
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
about what they think of their life

299
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
and about their experiences,

300
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
and there have been other efforts along those lines.

301
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
So in recent years, we have begun to learn

302
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
about the happiness of the two selves.

303
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
And the main lesson I think that we have learned

304
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
is they are really different.

305
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,820
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,

306
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
and that really doesn't teach you much

307
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
about how happily they're living their life,

308
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
and vice versa.

309
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,

310
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
the correlation is about .5.

311
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
What that means is if you met somebody,

312
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"

313
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
how much would you know about his height?

314
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Well, you would know something about his height,

315
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

316
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
You have that much uncertainty.

317
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,820
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

318
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
you have a lot of uncertainty

319
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
about how happy they are

320
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
with their experiencing self.

321
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
So the correlation is low.

322
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
We know something about what controls

323
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
satisfaction of the happiness self.

324
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
We know that money is very important,

325
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
goals are very important.

326
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,820
We know that happiness is mainly

327
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
being satisfied with people that we like,

328
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
spending time with people that we like.

329
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.

330
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,

331
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
you are going to end up

332
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
doing very different things.

333
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
The bottom line of what I've said here

334
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,820
is that we really should not think of happiness

335
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
as a substitute for well-being.

336
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
It is a completely different notion.

337
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Now, very quickly,

338
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,820
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness

339
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,820
is that we do not attend to the same things

340
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
when we think about life, and we actually live.

341
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,820
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,

342
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
you are not going to get to the correct answer.

343
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
When you ask that question,

344
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
you think people must be happier in California

345
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
if, say, you live in Ohio.

346
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
(Laughter)

347
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,820
And what happens is

348
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,820
when you think about living in California,

349
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
you are thinking of the contrast

350
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
between California and other places,

351
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
and that contrast, say, is in climate.

352
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Well, it turns out that climate

353
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
is not very important to the experiencing self

354
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
and it's not even very important to the reflective self

355
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
that decides how happy people are.

356
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,820
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,

357
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
you may end up -- some people may end up

358
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
moving to California.

359
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen

360
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.

361
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Well, their experiencing self

362
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
is not going to get happier.

363
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
We know that.

364
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,

365
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,820
because, when they think about it,

366
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,820
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,

367
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
and they will feel they made the right decision.

368
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
It is very difficult

369
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
to think straight about well-being,

370
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
and I hope I have given you a sense

371
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
of how difficult it is.

372
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Thank you.

373
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,820
(Applause)

374
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

375
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Thank you so much.

376
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

377
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

378
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
came out of that Gallup survey.

379
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Is that something you can share

380
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
since you do have a few moments left now?

381
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.

382
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey

383
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.

384
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
We found that with respect to the happiness

385
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
of the experiencing self.

386
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,820
When we looked at how feelings,

387
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
vary with income.

388
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
And it turns out that, below an income

389
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --

390
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,

391
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
so it's a large representative sample --

392
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...

393
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
CA: 60,000.

394
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
DK: 60,000.

395
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
(Laughter)

396
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,820
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,

397
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.

398
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.

399
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.

400
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Clearly, what is happening is

401
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
money does not buy you experiential happiness,

402
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,820
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,

403
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
and we can measure that misery

404
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
very, very clearly.

405
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,

406
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
you get a different story.

407
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.

408
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
That does not hold for emotions.

409
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about

410
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,820
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

411
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,820
If people took seriously that finding,

412
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
I mean, it seems to turn upside down

413
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
everything we believe about, like for example,

414
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
taxation policy and so forth.

415
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,

416
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
would take a finding like that seriously

417
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
and run public policy based on it?

418
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
DK: You know I think that there is recognition

419
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
of the role of happiness research in public policy.

420
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,

421
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
no question about that,

422
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
but in the U.K., it is happening,

423
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
and in other countries it is happening.

424
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,820
People are recognizing that they ought

425
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
to be thinking of happiness

426
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
when they think of public policy.

427
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
It's going to take a while,

428
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
and people are going to debate

429
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
whether they want to study experience happiness,

430
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
or whether they want to study life evaluation,

431
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,820
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

432
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
How to enhance happiness

433
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,820
goes very different ways depending on how you think,

434
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
and whether you think of the remembering self

435
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
or you think of the experiencing self.

436
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.

437
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
In the United States, efforts are being made

438
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
to measure the experience happiness of the population.

439
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,820
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,

440
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
part of national statistics.

441
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --

442
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
the most interesting policy discussion to track

443
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
over the next few years.

444
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.

445
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
