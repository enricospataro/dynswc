1
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,787
I want you to, for a moment,

2
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:18,637
think about playing a game of Monopoly,

3
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,244
except in this game, that combination

4
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:24,213
of skill, talent and luck

5
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,751
that help earn you success in games, as in life,

6
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,167
has been rendered irrelevant,

7
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,462
because this game's been rigged,

8
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,342
and you've got the upper hand.

9
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,221
You've got more money,

10
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:36,781
more opportunities to move around the board,

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,006
and more access to resources.

12
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,337
And as you think about that experience,

13
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:42,925
I want you to ask yourself,

14
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,695
how might that experience of being

15
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,825
a privileged player in a rigged game

16
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,748
change the way that you think about yourself

17
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:54,606
and regard that other player?

18
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:57,653
So we ran a study on the U.C. Berkeley campus

19
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,955
to look at exactly that question.

20
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:01,613
We brought in more than 100 pairs

21
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,374
of strangers into the lab,

22
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:06,194
and with the flip of a coin

23
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:07,981
randomly assigned one of the two

24
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:10,326
to be a rich player in a rigged game.

25
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:13,147
They got two times as much money.

26
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,648
When they passed Go,

27
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:16,854
they collected twice the salary,

28
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,827
and they got to roll both dice instead of one,

29
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,638
so they got to move around the board a lot more.

30
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,644
(Laughter)

31
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,357
And over the course of 15 minutes,

32
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:28,887
we watched through hidden
cameras what happened.

33
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,708
And what I want to do today, for the first time,

34
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,220
is show you a little bit of what we saw.

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,729
You're going to have to pardon the sound quality,

36
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,385
in some cases, because again,
these were hidden cameras.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,595
So we've provided subtitles.

38
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:40,985
Rich Player: How many 500s did you have?

39
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,220
Poor Player: Just one.

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,337
Rich Player: Are you serious.
Poor Player: Yeah.

41
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,090
Rich Player: I have three. (Laughs)

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,016
I don't know why they gave me so much.

43
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,854
Paul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players

44
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,196
that something was up.

45
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,491
One person clearly has a lot more money

46
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,640
than the other person, and yet,

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,782
as the game unfolded,

48
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,787
we saw very notable differences

49
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:01,236
and dramatic differences begin to emerge

50
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:03,110
between the two players.

51
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,830
The rich player

52
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,408
started to move around the board louder,

53
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:09,289
literally smacking the board with their piece

54
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,209
as he went around.

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,202
We were more likely to see signs of dominance

56
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,792
and nonverbal signs,

57
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,214
displays of power

58
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:23,169
and celebration among the rich players.

59
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,690
We had a bowl of pretzels
positioned off to the side.

60
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,351
It's on the bottom right corner there.

61
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,838
That allowed us to watch
participants' consummatory behavior.

62
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:35,456
So we're just tracking how
many pretzels participants eat.

63
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,389
Rich Player: Are those pretzels a trick?

64
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,315
Poor Player: I don't know.

65
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:42,454
PP: Okay, so no surprises, people are onto us.

66
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,959
They wonder what that bowl of pretzels

67
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,740
is doing there in the first place.

68
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,654
One even asks, like you just saw,

69
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:50,613
is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?

70
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:53,523
And yet, despite that, the power of the situation

71
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,824
seems to inevitably dominate,

72
00:02:55,824 --> 00:03:00,277
and those rich players start to eat more pretzels.

73
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,893
Rich Player: I love pretzels.

74
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,222
(Laughter)

75
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,938
PP: And as the game went on,

76
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,270
one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns

77
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,343
that we observed begin to emerge

78
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,214
was that the rich players actually

79
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:22,336
started to become ruder toward the other person,

80
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,407
less and less sensitive to the plight

81
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,251
of those poor, poor players,

82
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:28,322
and more and more demonstrative

83
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,791
of their material success,

84
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,997
more likely to showcase how well they're doing.

85
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:39,519
Rich Player: I have money for everything.

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,137
Poor Player: How much is that?

87
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,099
Rich Player: You owe me 24 dollars.

88
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,955
You're going to lose all your money soon.

89
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:50,115
I'll buy it. I have so much money.

90
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,061
I have so much money, it takes me forever.

91
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,021
Rich Player 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.

92
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,751
Rich Player 3: You're going
to run out of money soon.

93
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,599
I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.

94
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,915
PP: Okay, and here's what I think

95
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:02,663
was really, really interesting,

96
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,917
is that at the end of the 15 minutes,

97
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:10,310
we asked the players to talk about
their experience during the game.

98
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,385
And when the rich players talked about

99
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,267
why they had inevitably won

100
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,286
in this rigged game of Monopoly --

101
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:21,095
(Laughter) —

102
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,659
they talked about what they'd done

103
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,473
to buy those different properties

104
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:30,255
and earn their success in the game,

105
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,744
and they became far less attuned

106
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,459
to all those different features of the situation,

107
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,132
including that flip of a coin

108
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,447
that had randomly gotten them into

109
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,436
that privileged position in the first place.

110
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:46,274
And that's a really, really incredible insight

111
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:51,729
into how the mind makes sense of advantage.

112
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,950
Now this game of Monopoly can be used

113
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,793
as a metaphor for understanding society

114
00:04:56,793 --> 00:05:00,078
and its hierarchical structure, wherein some people

115
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,470
have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,

116
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,947
and a lot of people don't.

117
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,880
They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,994
and a lot less access to valued resources.

119
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:13,230
And what my colleagues and I for
the last seven years have been doing

120
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,299
is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.

121
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:20,583
What we've been finding across dozens of studies

122
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,000
and thousands of participants across this country

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,532
is that as a person's levels of wealth increase,

124
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:34,600
their feelings of compassion and empathy go down,

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,371
and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,

126
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,919
and their ideology of self-interest increases.

127
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,978
In surveys, we found that it's actually

128
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,855
wealthier individuals who are more likely

129
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:49,895
to moralize greed being good,

130
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,898
and that the pursuit of self-interest

131
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,614
is favorable and moral.

132
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:56,463
Now what I want to do today is talk about

133
00:05:56,463 --> 00:06:01,284
some of the implications
of this ideology self-interest,

134
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,647
talk about why we should
care about those implications,

135
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:07,289
and end with what might be done.

136
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,454
Some of the first studies that we ran in this area

137
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,740
looked at helping behavior,

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,899
something social psychologists call

139
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,990
pro-social behavior.

140
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,703
And we were really interested in who's more likely

141
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:20,051
to offer help to another person,

142
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:23,208
someone who's rich or someone who's poor.

143
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,610
In one of the studies, we bring in rich and poor

144
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,910
members of the community into the lab

145
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,404
and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.

146
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:35,014
We told the participants

147
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:37,462
that they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves,

148
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,437
or they could share a portion of it,

149
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:41,432
if they wanted to, with a stranger

150
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:42,903
who is totally anonymous.

151
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,939
They'll never meet that stranger and
the stranger will never meet them.

152
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,157
And we just monitor how much people give.

153
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:51,507
Individuals who made 25,000 sometimes

154
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,834
under 15,000 dollars a year,

155
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,061
gave 44 percent more of their money

156
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,144
to the stranger

157
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,452
than did individuals making 150,000

158
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,699
or 200,000 dollars a year.

159
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,447
We've had people play games

160
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,078
to see who's more or less likely to cheat

161
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,472
to increase their chances of winning a prize.

162
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,192
In one of the games, we actually rigged a computer

163
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,984
so that die rolls over a certain score

164
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:16,970
were impossible.

165
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,062
You couldn't get above 12 in this game,

166
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:23,174
and yet, the richer you were,

167
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:24,931
the more likely you were to cheat in this game

168
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:28,830
to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize,

169
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,675
sometimes by three to four times as much.

170
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,908
We ran another study where we looked at whether

171
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:38,131
people would be inclined to take candy

172
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:40,622
from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified

173
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,862
as being reserved for children --

174
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,304
(Laughter) —

175
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:48,145
participating -- I'm not kidding.

176
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,874
I know it sounds like I'm making a joke.

177
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:53,115
We explicitly told participants

178
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,984
this jar of candy's for children participating

179
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:57,468
in a developmental lab nearby.

180
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,518
They're in studies. This is for them.

181
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:03,161
And we just monitored how
much candy participants took.

182
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,674
Participants who felt rich

183
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,079
took two times as much candy

184
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,228
as participants who felt poor.

185
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:11,881
We've even studied cars,

186
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,743
not just any cars,

187
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,814
but whether drivers of different kinds of cars

188
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,917
are more or less inclined to break the law.

189
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,754
In one of these studies, we looked at

190
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:26,910
whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian

191
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,809
that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.

192
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,553
Now in California, as you all know,

193
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,077
because I'm sure we all do this,

194
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:38,005
it's the law to stop for a pedestrian
who's waiting to cross.

195
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,937
So here's an example of how we did it.

196
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,053
That's our confederate off to the left

197
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,642
posing as a pedestrian.

198
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:47,893
He approaches as the red truck successfully stops.

199
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,211
In typical California fashion, it's overtaken

200
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,548
by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.

201
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,104
(Laughter)

202
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,971
Now here's an example of a more expensive car,

203
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:57,709
a Prius, driving through,

204
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,017
and a BMW doing the same.

205
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,707
So we did this for hundreds of vehicles

206
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:08,063
on several days,

207
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,015
just tracking who stops and who doesn't.

208
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,480
What we found was that as the expensiveness

209
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,780
of a car increased,

210
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,664
the driver's tendencies to break the law

211
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:21,908
increased as well.

212
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:24,600
None of the cars, none of the cars

213
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,900
in our least expensive car category

214
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,465
broke the law.

215
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,858
Close to 50 percent of the cars

216
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,266
in our most expensive vehicle category

217
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:37,109
broke the law.

218
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,002
We've run other studies finding that

219
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:42,553
wealthier individuals are more
likely to lie in negotiations,

220
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,643
to endorse unethical behavior at work

221
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:47,251
like stealing cash from the cash register,

222
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:52,334
taking bribes, lying to customers.

223
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,896
Now I don't mean to suggest

224
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,599
that it's only wealthy people

225
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,511
who show these patterns of behavior.

226
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,280
Not at all. In fact, I think that we all,

227
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,244
in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,

228
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:06,216
struggle with these competing motivations

229
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:09,513
of when, or if, to put our own interests

230
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,867
above the interests of other people.

231
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:14,249
And that's understandable because

232
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,812
the American dream is an idea

233
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,911
in which we all have an equal opportunity

234
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,945
to succeed and prosper,

235
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,502
as long as we apply ourselves and work hard,

236
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,206
and a piece of that means that sometimes,

237
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,305
you need to put your own interests

238
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:33,735
above the interests and well-being
of other people around you.

239
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,904
But what we're finding is that,

240
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:38,312
the wealthier you are, the more likely you are

241
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:41,027
to pursue a vision of personal success,

242
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,262
of achievement and accomplishment,

243
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:46,610
to the detriment of others around you.

244
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,374
Here I've plotted for you the mean household income

245
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,990
received by each fifth and top
five percent of the population

246
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,160
over the last 20 years.

247
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,702
In 1993, the differences between the different

248
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:00,787
quintiles of the population, in terms of income,

249
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,384
are fairly egregious.

250
00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:05,981
It's not difficult to discern that there are differences.

251
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:08,865
But over the last 20 years, that significant difference

252
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:11,039
has become a grand canyon of sorts

253
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,193
between those at the top and everyone else.

254
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:17,885
In fact, the top 20 percent of our population

255
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,963
own close to 90 percent of the
total wealth in this country.

256
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,222
We're at unprecedented levels

257
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,710
of economic inequality.

258
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,790
What that means is that wealth is not only becoming

259
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,270
increasingly concentrated in the hands
of a select group of individuals,

260
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,654
but the American dream is becoming

261
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,602
increasingly unattainable

262
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:41,795
for an increasing majority of us.

263
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,062
And if it's the case, as we've been finding,

264
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:46,057
that the wealthier you are,

265
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:48,599
the more entitled you feel to that wealth,

266
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,592
and the more likely you are
to prioritize your own interests

267
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,559
above the interests of other people,

268
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,949
and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest,

269
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,683
well then there's no reason to think

270
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,781
that those patterns will change.

271
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:02,324
In fact, there's every reason to think

272
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,307
that they'll only get worse,

273
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,154
and that's what it would look like
if things just stayed the same,

274
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,781
at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.

275
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,502
Now, inequality, economic inequality,

276
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,426
is something we should all be concerned about,

277
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:18,955
and not just because of those at the bottom

278
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,469
of the social hierarchy,

279
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,709
but because individuals and groups

280
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:27,909
with lots of economic inequality do worse,

281
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,748
not just the people at the bottom, everyone.

282
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,875
There's a lot of really compelling research

283
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,467
coming out from top labs all over the world

284
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,355
showcasing the range of things

285
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,244
that are undermined

286
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:42,884
as economic inequality gets worse.

287
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,537
Social mobility, things we really care about,

288
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,018
physical health, social trust,

289
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,063
all go down as inequality goes up.

290
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,078
Similarly, negative things

291
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,690
in social collectives and societies,

292
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,784
things like obesity, and violence,

293
00:12:57,784 --> 00:12:59,405
imprisonment, and punishment,

294
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:03,547
are exacerbated as economic inequality increases.

295
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,957
Again, these are outcomes not just experienced

296
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,018
by a few, but that resound

297
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,619
across all strata of society.

298
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,735
Even people at the top experience these outcomes.

299
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:16,978
So what do we do?

300
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:20,449
This cascade of self-perpetuating,

301
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,957
pernicious, negative effects

302
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:26,366
could seem like something that's spun out of control,

303
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:28,284
and there's nothing we can do about it,

304
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:31,080
certainly nothing we as individuals could do.

305
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,913
But in fact, we've been finding

306
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:38,101
in our own laboratory research

307
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:43,191
that small psychological interventions,

308
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:46,500
small changes to people's values,

309
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,723
small nudges in certain directions,

310
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:53,288
can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.

311
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,340
For instance, reminding people

312
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,596
of the benefits of cooperation,

313
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,500
or the advantages of community,

314
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,435
cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian

315
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,970
as poor people.

316
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,347
In one study, we had people watch a brief video,

317
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:14,708
just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty

318
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,758
that served as a reminder of the needs of others

319
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,784
in the world around them,

320
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,814
and after watching that,

321
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:23,512
we looked at how willing people were

322
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:27,216
to offer up their own time to a stranger

323
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:30,635
presented to them in the lab who was in distress.

324
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,902
After watching this video, an hour later,

325
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:36,272
rich people became just as generous

326
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,231
of their own time to help out this other person,

327
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:40,936
a stranger, as someone who's poor,

328
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:43,387
suggesting that these differences are not

329
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,270
innate or categorical,

330
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,994
but are so malleable

331
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:48,920
to slight changes in people's values,

332
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,201
and little nudges of compassion

333
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,856
and bumps of empathy.

334
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:54,412
And beyond the walls of our lab,

335
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:58,442
we're even beginning to see 
signs of change in society.

336
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,885
Bill Gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals,

337
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,630
in his Harvard commencement speech,

338
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,754
talked about the problem facing society

339
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:09,104
of inequality as being the most daunting challenge,

340
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,700
and talked about what must be done to combat it,

341
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,935
saying, "Humanity's greatest advances

342
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,886
are not in its discoveries,

343
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:20,037
but in how those discoveries are applied

344
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,851
to reduce inequity."

345
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,854
And there's the Giving Pledge,

346
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:27,276
in which more than 100 of our nation's

347
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,663
wealthiest individuals

348
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:33,577
are pledging half of their fortunes to charity.

349
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,201
And there's the emergence

350
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,834
of dozens of grassroots movements,

351
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,137
like We are the One Percent,

352
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,001
the Resource Generation,

353
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,122
or Wealth for Common Good,

354
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,689
in which the most privileged

355
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,514
members of the population,

356
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:52,270
members of the one percent and elsewhere,

357
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,201
people who are wealthy,

358
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,789
are using their own economic resources,

359
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,818
adults and youth alike, that's
what's most striking to me,

360
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,467
leveraging their own privilege,

361
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,538
their own economic resources,

362
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:08,565
to combat inequality

363
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,475
by advocating for social policies,

364
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,356
changes in social values,

365
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,730
and changes in people's behavior,

366
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,793
that work against their own economic interests

367
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:23,066
but that may ultimately restore the American dream.

368
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,066
Thank you.

369
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:29,066
