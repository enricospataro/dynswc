1
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,331
I have a confession to make.

2
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:22,263
But first, I want you to make
a little confession to me.

3
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,353
In the past year,
I want you to just raise your hand

4
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:29,767
if you've experienced
relatively little stress.

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,818
Anyone?

6
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:34,699
How about a moderate amount of stress?

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,237
Who has experienced a lot of stress?

8
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,645
Yeah. Me too.

9
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,793
But that is not my confession.

10
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,578
My confession is this:

11
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:46,599
I am a health psychologist,

12
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:50,466
and my mission is to help people
be happier and healthier.

13
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,722
But I fear that something
I've been teaching

14
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:59,050
for the last 10 years
is doing more harm than good,

15
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:00,904
and it has to do with stress.

16
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:04,649
For years I've been telling people,
stress makes you sick.

17
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,544
It increases the risk of everything
from the common cold

18
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,340
to cardiovascular disease.

19
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:13,486
Basically, I've turned stress
into the enemy.

20
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:16,891
But I have changed my mind about stress,

21
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:20,084
and today, I want to change yours.

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,186
Let me start with the study
that made me rethink

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,197
my whole approach to stress.

24
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:30,459
This study tracked 30,000 adults
in the United States for eight years,

25
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:32,986
and they started by asking people,

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,202
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"

27
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,448
They also asked,

28
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:42,804
"Do you believe that stress
is harmful for your health?"

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,806
And then they used public death records
to find out who died.

30
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,011
(Laughter)

31
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,833
Okay.

32
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,007
Some bad news first.

33
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,432
People who experienced a lot of stress
in the previous year

34
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,209
had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.

35
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:04,191
But that was only true for the people

36
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:07,852
who also believed that stress
is harmful for your health.

37
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,636
(Laughter)

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,936
People who experienced a lot of stress

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,900
but did not view stress as harmful

40
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,601
were no more likely to die.

41
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,168
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying

42
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,492
of anyone in the study,

43
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,973
including people
who had relatively little stress.

44
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:27,336
Now the researchers estimated
that over the eight years

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,930
they were tracking deaths,

46
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:32,130
182,000 Americans died prematurely,

47
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,592
not from stress,

48
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,797
but from the belief
that stress is bad for you.

49
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,053
(Laughter)

50
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:41,119
That is over 20,000 deaths a year.

51
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:44,555
Now, if that estimate is correct,

52
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,818
that would make
believing stress is bad for you

53
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:50,913
the 15th largest cause of death
in the United States last year,

54
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,920
killing more people than skin cancer,
HIV/AIDS and homicide.

55
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,107
(Laughter)

56
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:01,932
You can see why this study freaked me out.

57
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:06,005
Here I've been spending
so much energy telling people

58
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,870
stress is bad for your health.

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,582
So this study got me wondering:

60
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,678
Can changing how you think
about stress make you healthier?

61
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:16,522
And here the science says yes.

62
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,604
When you change your mind about stress,

63
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,880
you can change
your body's response to stress.

64
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,237
Now to explain how this works,

65
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:27,118
I want you all to pretend
that you are participants

66
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,725
in a study designed to stress you out.

67
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,409
It's called the social stress test.

68
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,463
You come into the laboratory,

69
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,458
and you're told you have to give

70
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:41,097
a five-minute impromptu speech
on your personal weaknesses

71
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,754
to a panel of expert evaluators
sitting right in front of you,

72
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,636
and to make sure you feel the pressure,

73
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,607
there are bright lights
and a camera in your face,

74
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,090
kind of like this.

75
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:52,272
(Laughter)

76
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:55,176
And the evaluators have been trained

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,892
to give you discouraging,
non-verbal feedback,

78
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,090
like this.

79
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,155
(Exhales)

80
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,576
(Laughter)

81
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:11,152
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,

82
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:13,952
time for part two: a math test.

83
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,053
And unbeknownst to you,

84
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:19,636
the experimenter has been trained
to harass you during it.

85
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,455
Now we're going to all do this together.

86
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,849
It's going to be fun.

87
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:25,247
For me.

88
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,288
Okay.

89
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,519
(Laughter)

90
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:31,542
I want you all to count backwards from 996

91
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,934
in increments of seven.

92
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,562
You're going to do this out loud,

93
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,570
as fast as you can,

94
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,686
starting with 996.

95
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,748
Go!

96
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,129
(Audience counting)

97
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,942
Go faster. Faster please.

98
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,332
You're going too slow.

99
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:46,394
(Audience counting)

100
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,910
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

101
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,340
That guy made a mistake.

102
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,562
We are going to have to start
all over again.

103
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,587
(Laughter)

104
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:54,823
You're not very good at this, are you?

105
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,297
Okay, so you get the idea.

106
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,136
If you were actually in this study,

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,082
you'd probably be a little stressed out.

108
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:01,621
Your heart might be pounding,

109
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:05,025
you might be breathing faster,
maybe breaking out into a sweat.

110
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:09,621
And normally, we interpret
these physical changes as anxiety

111
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:12,510
or signs that we aren't coping
very well with the pressure.

112
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,811
But what if you viewed them instead

113
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:17,158
as signs that your body was energized,

114
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:20,162
was preparing you to meet this challenge?

115
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,446
Now that is exactly
what participants were told

116
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,924
in a study conducted
at Harvard University.

117
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,213
Before they went
through the social stress test,

118
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:32,419
they were taught to rethink
their stress response as helpful.

119
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:35,688
That pounding heart
is preparing you for action.

120
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,557
If you're breathing faster,
it's no problem.

121
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,792
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

122
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,339
And participants who learned to view
the stress response

123
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,576
as helpful for their performance,

124
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,083
well, they were less stressed out,
less anxious, more confident,

125
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,176
but the most fascinating finding to me

126
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,139
was how their physical
stress response changed.

127
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,451
Now, in a typical stress response,

128
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,267
your heart rate goes up,

129
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,671
and your blood vessels
constrict like this.

130
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,746
And this is one of the reasons
that chronic stress

131
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,605
is sometimes associated
with cardiovascular disease.

132
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,362
It's not really healthy to be
in this state all the time.

133
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:14,426
But in the study,

134
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,457
when participants viewed
their stress response as helpful,

135
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,449
their blood vessels
stayed relaxed like this.

136
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:22,773
Their heart was still pounding,

137
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,524
but this is a much healthier
cardiovascular profile.

138
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,179
It actually looks a lot like what happens

139
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:32,171
in moments of joy and courage.

140
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,731
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,

141
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:38,921
this one biological change

142
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,225
could be the difference

143
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,229
between a stress-induced
heart attack at age 50

144
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,477
and living well into your 90s.

145
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:49,237
And this is really what the new
science of stress reveals,

146
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,263
that how you think about stress matters.

147
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,906
So my goal as a health
psychologist has changed.

148
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,068
I no longer want
to get rid of your stress.

149
00:06:58,092 --> 00:07:01,026
I want to make you better at stress.

150
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,223
And we just did a little intervention.

151
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,279
If you raised your hand and said

152
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,348
you'd had a lot of stress
in the last year,

153
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,191
we could have saved your life,

154
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:12,742
because hopefully the next time
your heart is pounding from stress,

155
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,589
you're going to remember this talk

156
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,751
and you're going to think to yourself,

157
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:21,340
this is my body helping me
rise to this challenge.

158
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,264
And when you view stress in that way,

159
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,321
your body believes you,

160
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,828
and your stress response
becomes healthier.

161
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:34,176
Now I said I have over a decade
of demonizing stress

162
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,150
to redeem myself from,

163
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,760
so we are going to do
one more intervention.

164
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,888
I want to tell you

165
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:43,783
about one of the most under-appreciated
aspects of the stress response,

166
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,642
and the idea is this:

167
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,061
Stress makes you social.

168
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,846
To understand this side of stress,

169
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,713
we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,

170
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:58,661
and I know oxytocin has already gotten
as much hype as a hormone can get.

171
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:02,000
It even has its own cute nickname,
the cuddle hormone,

172
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,686
because it's released
when you hug someone.

173
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,635
But this is a very small part
of what oxytocin is involved in.

174
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,666
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.

175
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,240
It fine-tunes
your brain's social instincts.

176
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,771
It primes you to do things

177
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,711
that strengthen close relationships.

178
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:26,130
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact
with your friends and family.

179
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,716
It enhances your empathy.

180
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,424
It even makes you more willing
to help and support

181
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,132
the people you care about.

182
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:37,446
Some people have even suggested
we should snort oxytocin...

183
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,687
to become more compassionate and caring.

184
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,936
But here's what most people
don't understand about oxytocin.

185
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,050
It's a stress hormone.

186
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,044
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out

187
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,592
as part of the stress response.

188
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,843
It's as much a part
of your stress response

189
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,194
as the adrenaline that makes
your heart pound.

190
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,765
And when oxytocin is released
in the stress response,

191
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,395
it is motivating you to seek support.

192
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,179
Your biological stress response

193
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:13,722
is nudging you to tell
someone how you feel,

194
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,434
instead of bottling it up.

195
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,206
Your stress response wants
to make sure you notice

196
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,525
when someone else
in your life is struggling

197
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:23,508
so that you can support each other.

198
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,779
When life is difficult,

199
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:30,390
your stress response wants you
to be surrounded

200
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,933
by people who care about you.

201
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:37,133
Okay, so how is knowing this side
of stress going to make you healthier?

202
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:40,067
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act
on your brain.

203
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,458
It also acts on your body,

204
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,657
and one of its main roles in your body

205
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:49,342
is to protect your cardiovascular system
from the effects of stress.

206
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:52,320
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.

207
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,765
It also helps your blood vessels
stay relaxed during stress.

208
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:59,162
But my favorite effect on the body
is actually on the heart.

209
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:03,124
Your heart has receptors for this hormone,

210
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:06,602
and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate

211
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,760
and heal from any stress-induced damage.

212
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:14,293
This stress hormone
strengthens your heart.

213
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,653
And the cool thing
is that all of these physical benefits

214
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:23,703
of oxytocin are enhanced
by social contact and social support.

215
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:26,622
So when you reach out
to others under stress,

216
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:29,895
either to seek support
or to help someone else,

217
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,903
you release more of this hormone,

218
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,165
your stress response becomes healthier,

219
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,840
and you actually recover
faster from stress.

220
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:39,597
I find this amazing,

221
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:43,525
that your stress response
has a built-in mechanism

222
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,430
for stress resilience,

223
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,835
and that mechanism is human connection.

224
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:54,194
I want to finish by telling you
about one more study.

225
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,336
And listen up, because this study
could also save a life.

226
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,726
This study tracked about 1,000 adults
in the United States,

227
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,889
and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,

228
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:08,158
and they started the study by asking,

229
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:11,385
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"

230
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,100
They also asked,

231
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:18,759
"How much time have you spent
helping out friends, neighbors,

232
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,621
people in your community?"

233
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:24,704
And then they used public records
for the next five years

234
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,107
to find out who died.

235
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,008
Okay, so the bad news first:

236
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:32,967
For every major stressful life experience,

237
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,016
like financial difficulties
or family crisis,

238
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,210
that increased the risk
of dying by 30 percent.

239
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:44,241
But -- and I hope you
are expecting a "but" by now --

240
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,672
but that wasn't true for everyone.

241
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:50,334
People who spent time caring for others

242
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:54,861
showed absolutely no stress-related
increase in dying.

243
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:55,885
Zero.

244
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,633
Caring created resilience.

245
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,512
And so we see once again

246
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,150
that the harmful effects
of stress on your health

247
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:05,814
are not inevitable.

248
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:08,834
How you think and how you act

249
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:11,898
can transform your experience of stress.

250
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:17,732
When you choose to view
your stress response as helpful,

251
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:20,889
you create the biology of courage.

252
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,784
And when you choose to connect
with others under stress,

253
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:27,926
you can create resilience.

254
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:34,956
Now I wouldn't necessarily ask
for more stressful experiences in my life,

255
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,988
but this science has given me
a whole new appreciation for stress.

256
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,169
Stress gives us access to our hearts.

257
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:49,376
The compassionate heart
that finds joy and meaning

258
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,914
in connecting with others,

259
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,476
and yes, your pounding physical heart,

260
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,361
working so hard to give you
strength and energy.

261
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:03,084
And when you choose to view
stress in this way,

262
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,596
you're not just getting better at stress,

263
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,363
you're actually making
a pretty profound statement.

264
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:14,456
You're saying that you can trust yourself
to handle life's challenges.

265
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:20,511
And you're remembering
that you don't have to face them alone.

266
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,529
Thank you.

267
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,750
(Applause)

268
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,882
Chris Anderson: This is kind
of amazing, what you're telling us.

269
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:38,813
It seems amazing to me
that a belief about stress

270
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:42,778
can make so much difference
to someone's life expectancy.

271
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,522
How would that extend to advice,

272
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,689
like, if someone is making
a lifestyle choice

273
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:51,568
between, say, a stressful job
and a non-stressful job,

274
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:54,249
does it matter which way they go?

275
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:56,778
It's equally wise to go
for the stressful job

276
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,715
so long as you believe
that you can handle it, in some sense?

277
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,999
KM: Yeah, and one thing
we know for certain

278
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:04,407
is that chasing meaning
is better for your health

279
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,011
than trying to avoid discomfort.

280
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:09,083
And so I would say that's really
the best way to make decisions,

281
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:11,830
is go after what it is
that creates meaning in your life

282
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:14,911
and then trust yourself to handle
the stress that follows.

283
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,950
CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.
It's pretty cool.

284
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:20,772
(Applause)
