1
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,796
That splendid music, the coming-in music,

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,701
"The Elephant March" from "Aida,"
is the music I've chosen for my funeral.

3
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:23,796
(Laughter)

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,796
And you can see why. It's triumphal.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,796
I won't feel anything, but if I could,

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,796
I would feel triumphal
at having lived at all,

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,916
and at having lived
on this splendid planet,

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,053
and having been given
the opportunity to understand

9
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:48,268
something about why I was here
in the first place, before not being here.

10
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:53,687
Can you understand
my quaint English accent?

11
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,582
(Laughter)

12
00:00:56,471 --> 00:01:01,546
Like everybody else, I was entranced
yesterday by the animal session.

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,009
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;

14
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,259
the beauty of the things that they showed.

15
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:14,796
The only slight jarring note was when
Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,651
"the most splendid creatures
that God put on this earth."

17
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:22,276
Now of course, we know
that he didn't really mean that,

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,453
but in this country at the moment,
you can't be too careful.

19
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,796
(Laughter)

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,796
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem
of our subject: the theory of design,

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,519
Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection.

22
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:42,796
In professional circles everywhere,
it's of course universally accepted.

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,796
In non-professional circles
outside America, it's largely ignored.

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,796
But in non-professional
circles within America,

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,796
it arouses so much hostility --

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,896
(Laughter)

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,550
it's fair to say that American biologists
are in a state of war.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,795
The war is so worrying at present,

29
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,392
with court cases coming
up in one state after another,

30
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,796
that I felt I had to say
something about it.

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,796
If you want to know what I have
to say about Darwinism itself,

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,796
I'm afraid you're going
to have to look at my books,

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,796
which you won't find
in the bookstore outside.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,796
(Laughter)

35
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,796
Contemporary court cases

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,796
often concern an allegedly
new version of creationism,

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,119
called "Intelligent Design," or ID.

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,612
Don't be fooled.
There's nothing new about ID.

39
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,319
It's just creationism under another name,

40
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:43,701
rechristened --
I choose the word advisedly --

41
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:44,796
(Laughter)

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,796
for tactical, political reasons.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,796
The arguments of so-called ID theorists

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,192
are the same old arguments
that had been refuted again and again,

45
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,649
since Darwin down to the present day.

46
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:58,796
There is an effective evolution lobby

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,916
coordinating the fight
on behalf of science,

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,796
and I try to do all I can to help them,

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,796
but they get quite upset
when people like me dare to mention

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,399
that we happen to be atheists
as well as evolutionists.

51
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:16,796
They see us as rocking the boat,
and you can understand why.

52
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:22,238
Creationists, lacking any coherent
scientific argument for their case,

53
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:27,216
fall back on the popular
phobia against atheism:

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,796
Teach your children
evolution in biology class,

55
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,796
and they'll soon move on to drugs,
grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."

56
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,609
(Laughter)

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,796
In fact, of course, educated
theologians from the Pope down

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,944
are firm in their support of evolution.

59
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:49,625
This book, "Finding
Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,

60
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:53,712
is one of the most effective attacks
on Intelligent Design that I know

61
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:57,796
and it's all the more effective because
it's written by a devout Christian.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,402
People like Kenneth Miller could be called
a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,

63
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:03,796
(Laughter)

64
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,547
because they expose the lie
that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,

65
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:10,194
tantamount to atheism.

66
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:13,352
People like me, on the other
hand, rock the boat.

67
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:17,796
But here, I want to say something
nice about creationists.

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,496
It's not a thing I often do,
so listen carefully.

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,796
(Laughter)

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,796
I think they're right about one thing.

71
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,796
I think they're right that evolution

72
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,463
is fundamentally hostile to religion.

73
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:33,677
I've already said that many individual
evolutionists, like the Pope,

74
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,796
are also religious, but I think
they're deluding themselves.

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,224
I believe a true
understanding of Darwinism

76
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:43,788
is deeply corrosive to religious faith.

77
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,392
Now, it may sound as though
I'm about to preach atheism,

78
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,248
and I want to reassure you
that that's not what I'm going to do.

79
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,796
In an audience
as sophisticated as this one,

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,173
that would be preaching to the choir.

81
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:03,293
No, what I want to urge upon you --

82
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:07,060
(Laughter)

83
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:11,796
Instead, what I want to urge
upon you is militant atheism.

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,796
(Laughter)

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,018
(Applause)

86
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,797
But that's putting it too negatively.

87
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:24,470
If I was a person who were interested
in preserving religious faith,

88
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:29,643
I would be very afraid of the positive
power of evolutionary science,

89
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,516
and indeed science generally,
but evolution in particular,

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,402
to inspire and enthrall,
precisely because it is atheistic.

91
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:43,910
Now, the difficult problem
for any theory of biological design

92
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:49,196
is to explain the massive statistical
improbability of living things.

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,592
Statistical improbability
in the direction of good design --

94
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,504
"complexity" is another word for this.

95
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,836
The standard creationist argument --

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,796
there is only one;
they're all reduced to this one --

97
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,200
takes off from
a statistical improbability.

98
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,510
Living creatures are too complex
to have come about by chance;

99
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,796
therefore, they must have had a designer.

100
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:12,858
This argument of course,
shoots itself in the foot.

101
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:16,197
Any designer capable of designing
something really complex

102
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,802
has to be even more complex himself,

103
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:22,796
and that's before we even start
on the other things he's expected to do,

104
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,734
like forgive sins, bless
marriages, listen to prayers --

105
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,796
favor our side in a war --

106
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,206
(Laughter)

107
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,796
disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.

108
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,796
(Laughter)

109
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,796
Complexity is the problem
that any theory of biology has to solve,

110
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,527
and you can't solve it by postulating
an agent that is even more complex,

111
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:48,161
thereby simply compounding the problem.

112
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:53,145
Darwinian natural selection
is so stunningly elegant

113
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,994
because it solves the problem
of explaining complexity

114
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,073
in terms of nothing but simplicity.

115
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:04,183
Essentially, it does it
by providing a smooth ramp

116
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,522
of gradual, step-by-step increment.

117
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:10,450
But here, I only want to make the point

118
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:14,164
that the elegance of Darwinism
is corrosive to religion,

119
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:18,796
precisely because it is so elegant,
so parsimonious, so powerful,

120
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,534
so economically powerful.

121
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:29,002
It has the sinewy economy
of a beautiful suspension bridge.

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,411
The God theory is not just a bad theory.

123
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,205
It turns out to be -- in principle --

124
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,796
incapable of doing the job required of it.

125
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:41,395
So, returning to tactics
and the evolution lobby,

126
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,541
I want to argue that rocking the boat

127
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:49,272
may be just the right thing to do.

128
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,868
My approach to attacking creationism is --

129
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,375
unlike the evolution lobby --

130
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,129
my approach to attacking creationism
is to attack religion as a whole.

131
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:05,438
And at this point I need
to acknowledge the remarkable taboo

132
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,948
against speaking ill of religion,

133
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:11,321
and I'm going to do so in the words
of the late Douglas Adams,

134
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,584
a dear friend who,
if he never came to TED,

135
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,590
certainly should have been invited.

136
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:17,081
(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)

137
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:20,128
Richard Dawkins: He was. Good.
I thought he must have been.

138
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:22,996
He begins this speech,
which was tape recorded in Cambridge

139
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,796
shortly before he died --

140
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,393
he begins by explaining how science
works through the testing of hypotheses

141
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:33,020
that are framed to be vulnerable
to disproof, and then he goes on.

142
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:36,796
I quote, "Religion doesn't
seem to work like that.

143
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,796
It has certain ideas at the heart of it,
which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'

144
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,796
What it means is:
here is an idea or a notion

145
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,475
that you're not allowed
to say anything bad about.

146
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:51,796
You're just not. Why not?
Because you're not."

147
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,724
(Laughter)

148
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,169
"Why should it be
that it's perfectly legitimate

149
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,182
to support the Republicans or Democrats,

150
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,566
this model of economics versus that,

151
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,555
Macintosh instead of Windows,

152
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,540
but to have an opinion
about how the universe began,

153
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,200
about who created the universe --

154
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:10,873
no, that's holy.

155
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:14,970
So, we're used to not
challenging religious ideas,

156
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:18,184
and it's very interesting how much
of a furor Richard creates

157
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,367
when he does it." --

158
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,191
He meant me, not that one.

159
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,796
"Everybody gets absolutely
frantic about it,

160
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,408
because you're not allowed
to say these things.

161
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,129
Yet when you look at it rationally,

162
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,249
there's no reason why those ideas

163
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,948
shouldn't be as open
to debate as any other,

164
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,041
except that we've agreed
somehow between us

165
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:38,439
that they shouldn't be."

166
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:41,120
And that's the end
of the quote from Douglas.

167
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:47,796
In my view, not only is science
corrosive to religion;

168
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,971
religion is corrosive to science.

169
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:55,391
It teaches people
to be satisfied with trivial,

170
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:58,438
supernatural non-explanations,

171
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:02,193
and blinds them to the wonderful,
real explanations

172
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,796
that we have within our grasp.

173
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,456
It teaches them to accept
authority, revelation and faith,

174
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,949
instead of always insisting on evidence.

175
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:20,440
There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture
from his book, "Last Chance to See."

176
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,480
Now, there's a typical scientific journal,

177
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,137
The Quarterly Review of Biology.

178
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,017
And I'm going to put
together, as guest editor,

179
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:34,286
a special issue on the question,
"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"

180
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,407
And the first paper
is a standard scientific paper,

181
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,306
presenting evidence,

182
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,065
"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,

183
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,510
and potassium argon dated
crater in Yucatan,

184
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,145
indicate that an asteroid
killed the dinosaurs."

185
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:49,796
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.

186
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,353
Now, the next one.

187
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:54,042
"The President of the Royal Society

188
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:58,554
has been vouchsafed
a strong inner conviction

189
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,081
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

190
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,058
(Laughter)

191
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,152
"It has been privately
revealed to Professor Huxtane

192
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:13,097
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

193
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,509
(Laughter)

194
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,081
"Professor Hordley was brought up

195
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:21,796
to have total and unquestioning faith" --

196
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,852
(Laughter) --

197
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:27,672
"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

198
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,796
"Professor Hawkins has
promulgated an official dogma

199
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,264
binding on all loyal Hawkinsians

200
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:41,157
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

201
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:43,121
(Laughter)

202
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:47,644
That's inconceivable, of course.

203
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,898
But suppose --

204
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,968
[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory
cannot be patriotic citizens]

205
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,707
(Laughter)

206
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,350
(Applause)

207
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,796
In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.

208
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,638
whether he recognized
the equal citizenship and patriotism

209
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:08,796
of Americans who are atheists.

210
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,796
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.

211
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,796
"No, I don't know that atheists
should be considered citizens,

212
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,796
nor should they be considered patriots.

213
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,454
This is one nation under God."

214
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,010
Bush's bigotry
was not an isolated mistake,

215
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,319
blurted out in the heat
of the moment and later retracted.

216
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:32,190
He stood by it in the face of repeated
calls for clarification or withdrawal.

217
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:33,444
He really meant it.

218
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:38,023
More to the point, he knew
it posed no threat to his election --

219
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,229
quite the contrary.

220
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,983
Democrats as well as Republicans
parade their religiousness

221
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,731
if they want to get elected.

222
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:48,915
Both parties invoke
"one nation under God."

223
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,251
What would Thomas Jefferson have said?

224
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,901
[In every country and in every age,
the priest has been hostile to liberty]

225
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:58,796
Incidentally, I'm not usually
very proud of being British,

226
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,796
but you can't help making the comparison.

227
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:09,789
(Applause)

228
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,796
In practice, what is an atheist?

229
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,128
An atheist is just somebody
who feels about Yahweh

230
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:24,415
the way any decent Christian feels
about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.

231
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,796
As has been said before, we are
all atheists about most of the gods

232
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,125
that humanity has ever believed in.

233
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,796
Some of us just go one god further.

234
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,796
(Laughter)

235
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,796
(Applause)

236
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,154
And however we define atheism,
it's surely the kind of academic belief

237
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:50,796
that a person is entitled
to hold without being vilified

238
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,976
as an unpatriotic,
unelectable non-citizen.

239
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:59,249
Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact
that to own up to being an atheist

240
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:03,813
is tantamount to introducing yourself
as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.

241
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:08,105
And that all stems
from the perception of atheists

242
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:12,034
as some kind of weird, way-out minority.

243
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,796
Natalie Angier wrote a rather
sad piece in the New Yorker,

244
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,883
saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.

245
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,678
She clearly feels
in a beleaguered minority.

246
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:25,957
But actually, how do American atheists
stack up numerically?

247
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,719
The latest survey makes
surprisingly encouraging reading.

248
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:33,546
Christianity, of course, takes a massive
lion's share of the population,

249
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,164
with nearly 160 million.

250
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,553
But what would you think
was the second largest group,

251
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:45,013
convincingly outnumbering Jews
with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,

252
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:48,687
Hindus, Buddhists and all other
religions put together?

253
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:51,354
The second largest group,
with nearly 30 million,

254
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:54,568
is the one described
as non-religious or secular.

255
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,796
You can't help wondering
why vote-seeking politicians

256
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,002
are so proverbially overawed by the power
of, for example, the Jewish lobby --

257
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:08,343
the state of Israel seems to owe its very
existence to the American Jewish vote --

258
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,796
while at the same time,

259
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,910
consigning the non-religious
to political oblivion.

260
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,796
This secular non-religious vote,
if properly mobilized,

261
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,733
is nine times as numerous
as the Jewish vote.

262
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,796
Why does this far more
substantial minority

263
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,027
not make a move to exercise
its political muscle?

264
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,875
Well, so much for quantity.
How about quality?

265
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,462
Is there any correlation,
positive or negative,

266
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:40,497
between intelligence
and tendency to be religious?

267
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,758
[Them folks misunderestimated me]

268
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:46,870
(Laughter)

269
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:50,796
The survey that I quoted,
which is the ARIS survey,

270
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,868
didn't break down its data
by socio-economic class or education,

271
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:55,614
IQ or anything else.

272
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:59,796
But a recent article by Paul G. Bell
in the Mensa magazine

273
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,796
provides some straws in the wind.

274
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,297
Mensa, as you know,
is an international organization

275
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:07,631
for people with very high IQ.

276
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:12,590
And from a meta-analysis
of the literature,

277
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:17,796
Bell concludes that, I quote --
"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927

278
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,115
on the relationship
between religious belief,

279
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,605
and one's intelligence
or educational level,

280
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,796
all but four found an inverse connection.

281
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,437
That is, the higher one's intelligence
or educational level,

282
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,796
the less one is likely to be religious."

283
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,995
Well, I haven't seen
the original 42 studies,

284
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,027
and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,

285
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:41,764
but I would like to see more
studies done along those lines.

286
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,851
And I know that there are --
if I could put a little plug here --

287
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,471
there are people in this audience

288
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:51,796
easily capable of financing a massive
research survey to settle the question,

289
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,405
and I put the suggestion up,
for what it's worth.

290
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:56,079
But let me know show you some data

291
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:58,332
that have been properly
published and analyzed,

292
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:02,348
on one special group --
namely, top scientists.

293
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:08,796
In 1998, Larson and Witham
polled the cream of American scientists,

294
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,511
those who'd been honored by election
to the National Academy of Sciences,

295
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,166
and among this select group,

296
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,637
belief in a personal God dropped
to a shattering seven percent.

297
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,567
About 20 percent are agnostic;
the rest could fairly be called atheists.

298
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:29,796
Similar figures obtained
for belief in personal immortality.

299
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,796
Among biological scientists,
the figure is even lower:

300
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,575
5.5 percent, only, believe in God.

301
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,796
Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.

302
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,796
I've not seen corresponding
figures for elite scholars

303
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,796
in other fields,
such as history or philosophy,

304
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,994
but I'd be surprised
if they were different.

305
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,534
So, we've reached a truly
remarkable situation,

306
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,573
a grotesque mismatch
between the American intelligentsia

307
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,366
and the American electorate.

308
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:03,796
A philosophical opinion
about the nature of the universe,

309
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,796
which is held by the vast majority
of top American scientists

310
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,676
and probably the majority
of the intelligentsia generally,

311
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,500
is so abhorrent to the American electorate

312
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:19,428
that no candidate for popular election
dare affirm it in public.

313
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,796
If I'm right, this means that high office

314
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,466
in the greatest country in the world

315
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,577
is barred to the very people
best qualified to hold it --

316
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:30,796
the intelligentsia --

317
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,796
unless they are prepared
to lie about their beliefs.

318
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,314
To put it bluntly:
American political opportunities

319
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:39,796
are heavily loaded against those

320
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,605
who are simultaneously
intelligent and honest.

321
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:43,835
(Laughter)

322
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:50,170
(Applause)

323
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:53,796
I'm not a citizen of this country,
so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming

324
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,796
if I suggest that something
needs to be done.

325
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,320
(Laughter)

326
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,796
And I've already hinted
what that something is.

327
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,577
From what I've seen of TED, I think this
may be the ideal place to launch it.

328
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,450
Again, I fear it will cost money.

329
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:11,021
We need a consciousness-raising,

330
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,796
coming-out campaign for American atheists.

331
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,796
(Laughter)

332
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,540
This could be similar to the campaign
organized by homosexuals

333
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:21,796
a few years ago,

334
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,153
although heaven forbid
that we should stoop to public outing

335
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:26,796
of people against their will.

336
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,796
In most cases, people who out themselves

337
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,796
will help to destroy the myth that
there is something wrong with atheists.

338
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,973
On the contrary,

339
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:38,067
they'll demonstrate that atheists
are often the kinds of people

340
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,796
who could serve as decent
role models for your children,

341
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,587
the kinds of people an advertising agent
could use to recommend a product,

342
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:48,443
the kinds of people
who are sitting in this room.

343
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,796
There should be a snowball effect,
a positive feedback,

344
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,796
such that the more names
we have, the more we get.

345
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,179
There could be non-linearities,
threshold effects.

346
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:01,282
When a critical mass has been obtained,

347
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:04,211
there's an abrupt
acceleration in recruitment.

348
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,949
And again, it will need money.

349
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:10,796
I suspect that the word "atheist" itself

350
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,287
contains or remains a stumbling block

351
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,987
far out of proportion
to what it actually means,

352
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,584
and a stumbling block to people

353
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,665
who otherwise might be
happy to out themselves.

354
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,414
So, what other words might
be used to smooth the path,

355
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:26,986
oil the wheels, sugar the pill?

356
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:31,200
Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --

357
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:34,328
and not only out of loyalty
to his friend Huxley,

358
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,879
who coined the term.

359
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:39,386
Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist

360
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,108
in the same sense of denying
the existence of a God.

361
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,796
I think that generally an 'agnostic'

362
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,928
would be the most correct
description of my state of mind."

363
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:53,484
He even became uncharacteristically
tetchy with Edward Aveling.

364
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,796
Aveling was a militant atheist

365
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,796
who failed to persuade Darwin

366
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,796
to accept the dedication
of his book on atheism --

367
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,510
incidentally, giving rise
to a fascinating myth

368
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:06,931
that Karl Marx tried to dedicate
"Das Kapital" to Darwin,

369
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:09,323
which he didn't, it was
actually Edward Aveling.

370
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:13,796
What happened was that Aveling's
mistress was Marx's daughter,

371
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,101
and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,

372
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:21,339
Marx's papers became muddled
up with Aveling's papers,

373
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,670
and a letter from Darwin saying,
"My dear sir, thank you very much

374
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:28,057
but I don't want you
to dedicate your book to me,"

375
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,334
was mistakenly supposed
to be addressed to Marx,

376
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:34,675
and that gave rise to this whole
myth, which you've probably heard.

377
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:39,238
It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx
tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

378
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:45,629
Anyway, it was Aveling, and when
they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.

379
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:50,341
"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"

380
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:58,255
"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was
simply 'atheist' writ respectable,

381
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,088
and 'atheist' was simply
'agnostic' writ aggressive."

382
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,334
Darwin complained, "But why
should you be so aggressive?"

383
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:09,557
Darwin thought that atheism might be
well and good for the intelligentsia,

384
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:12,819
but that ordinary people were
not, quote, "ripe for it."

385
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:17,081
Which is, of course, our old friend,
the "don't rock the boat" argument.

386
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,796
It's not recorded whether Aveling told
Darwin to come down off his high horse.

387
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,647
(Laughter)

388
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,021
But in any case,
that was more than 100 years ago.

389
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,433
You'd think we might have
grown up since then.

390
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:35,213
Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,

391
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:39,362
who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath
for reasons of cultural solidarity,

392
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:42,978
describes himself
as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."

393
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:45,449
He won't call himself an atheist

394
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:48,796
because it's, in principle,
impossible to prove a negative,

395
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,796
but "agnostic" on its own might
suggest that God's existence

396
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,962
was therefore on equal terms
of likelihood as his non-existence.

397
00:22:56,986 --> 00:23:01,303
So, my friend is strictly
agnostic about the tooth fairy,

398
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:04,320
but it isn't very likely, is it?

399
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:05,796
Like God.

400
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,827
Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."

401
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,911
Bertrand Russell made the same point

402
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:13,498
using a hypothetical teapot
in orbit about Mars.

403
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,796
You would strictly have to be agnostic

404
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,249
about whether there is a teapot
in orbit about Mars,

405
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,273
but that doesn't mean you treat
the likelihood of its existence

406
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:24,101
as on all fours with its non-existence.

407
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,430
The list of things which we strictly
have to be agnostic about

408
00:23:27,454 --> 00:23:30,796
doesn't stop at tooth fairies
and teapots; it's infinite.

409
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,297
If you want to believe
one particular one of them --

410
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:37,401
unicorns or tooth fairies
or teapots or Yahweh --

411
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,796
the onus is on you to say why.

412
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,178
The onus is not on the rest
of us to say why not.

413
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,202
We, who are atheists,

414
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:48,617
are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.

415
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:51,282
(Laughter)

416
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,894
But we don't bother to say so.

417
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:57,489
And this is why my friend
uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"

418
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,088
as a label for what most people
would call atheist.

419
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:05,918
Nonetheless, if we want to attract
deep-down atheists to come out publicly,

420
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:09,031
we're going to have find
something better to stick on our banner

421
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,553
than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."

422
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:13,995
So, how about "humanist"?

423
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,796
This has the advantage of a worldwide
network of well-organized associations

424
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,796
and journals and things already in place.

425
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,768
My problem with it is only
its apparent anthropocentrism.

426
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,798
One of the things
we've learned from Darwin

427
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,298
is that the human species is only one

428
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:34,126
among millions of cousins,
some close, some distant.

429
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,683
And there are other possibilities,
like "naturalist,"

430
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:39,142
but that also has problems of confusion,

431
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,372
because Darwin would have
thought naturalist --

432
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,531
"Naturalist" means, of course,
as opposed to "supernaturalist" --

433
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:45,919
and it is used sometimes --

434
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,337
Darwin would have been confused
by the other sense of "naturalist,"

435
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:50,552
which he was, of course,

436
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:55,568
and I suppose there might be others
who would confuse it with "nudism".

437
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:56,810
(Laughter)

438
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:03,732
Such people might be those
belonging to the British lynch mob,

439
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:08,796
which last year attacked a pediatrician
in mistake for a pedophile.

440
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,345
(Laughter)

441
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:17,529
I think the best of the available
alternatives for "atheist"

442
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,796
is simply "non-theist."

443
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,820
It lacks the strong connotation
that there's definitely no God,

444
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:27,703
and it could therefore easily be embraced
by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.

445
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:33,258
It's completely compatible
with the God of the physicists.

446
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:39,796
When atheists like Stephen Hawking
and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"

447
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,533
they use it of course
as a metaphorical shorthand

448
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:48,128
for that deep, mysterious part of physics
which we don't yet understand.

449
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:54,057
"Non-theist" will do for all that,
yet unlike "atheist,"

450
00:25:54,081 --> 00:26:00,930
it doesn't have the same
phobic, hysterical responses.

451
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:03,232
But I think, actually, the alternative

452
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:06,105
is to grasp the nettle
of the word "atheism" itself,

453
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,796
precisely because it is a taboo word,

454
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,098
carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.

455
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:16,466
Critical mass may be harder
to achieve with the word "atheist"

456
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,045
than with the word "non-theist,"

457
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,029
or some other non-confrontational word.

458
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:24,267
But if we did achieve it
with that dread word "atheist" itself,

459
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,084
the political impact
would be even greater.

460
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:31,568
Now, I said that if I were religious,
I'd be very afraid of evolution --

461
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,226
I'd go further: I would fear science
in general, if properly understood.

462
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,463
And this is because
the scientific worldview

463
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:41,552
is so much more exciting, more poetic,

464
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:44,053
more filled with sheer wonder

465
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:49,113
than anything in the poverty-stricken
arsenals of the religious imagination.

466
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:55,796
As Carl Sagan, another recently
dead hero, put it,

467
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,386
"How is it that hardly any major
religion has looked at science

468
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,705
and concluded, 'This
is better than we thought!

469
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,201
The universe is much bigger
than our prophet said,

470
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:10,432
grander, more subtle, more elegant'?

471
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:12,796
Instead they say, 'No, no, no!

472
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,454
My god is a little god,
and I want him to stay that way.'

473
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,129
A religion, old or new,

474
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:22,796
that stressed the magnificence
of the universe

475
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,796
as revealed by modern science,

476
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,484
might be able to draw forth
reserves of reverence and awe

477
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:31,445
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."

478
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,176
Now, this is an elite audience,

479
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,954
and I would therefore expect
about 10 percent of you to be religious.

480
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:47,203
Many of you probably subscribe
to our polite cultural belief

481
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:49,416
that we should respect religion.

482
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:53,796
But I also suspect
that a fair number of those

483
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,177
secretly despise religion as much as I do.

484
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:58,848
(Laughter)

485
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:01,725
If you're one of them, and of course
many of you may not be,

486
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,057
but if you are one of them,

487
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,149
I'm asking you to stop being polite,

488
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:06,982
come out, and say so.

489
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,932
And if you happen to be rich,

490
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:13,538
give some thought to ways
in which you might make a difference.

491
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,559
The religious lobby in this country

492
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:22,113
is massively financed by foundations --
to say nothing of all the tax benefits --

493
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:26,661
by foundations, such as the Templeton
Foundation and the Discovery Institute.

494
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:31,002
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.

495
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:35,796
If my books sold as well
as Stephen Hawking's books,

496
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,766
instead of only as well as
Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.

497
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:49,572
People are always going on about,
"How did September the 11th change you?"

498
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,313
Well, here's how it changed me.

499
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,954
Let's all stop being so damned respectful.

500
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,796
Thank you very much.

501
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,820
(Applause)
