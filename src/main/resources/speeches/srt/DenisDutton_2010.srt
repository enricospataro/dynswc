1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Delighted to be here

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
which is beauty.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
actually, for a living.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I try to figure out intellectually,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
philosophically, psychologically,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
what the experience of beauty is,

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
what sensibly can be said about it

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Now this is an extremely complicated subject,

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
in part because the things that we call beautiful

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
are so different.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
I mean just think of the sheer variety --

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
a baby's face,

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
or the plays of Chekhov,

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
a central California landscape,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
"Der Rosenkavalier,"

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
a stunning match-winning goal

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
in a World Cup soccer match,

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
a Jane Austen novel,

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
This brief list includes human beings,

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
natural landforms,

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
works of art and skilled human actions.

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
An account that explains the presence of beauty

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
in everything on this list

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
is not going to be easy.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
I can, however, give you at least a taste

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
of what I regard

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
as the most powerful theory of beauty

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
we yet have.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,

38
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
not from a postmodern art theorist

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
or a bigwig art critic.

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
No, this theory

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
comes from an expert

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
and you know who I mean:

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Charles Darwin.

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Of course, a lot of people think they already know

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
the proper answer to the question,

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,820
"What is beauty?"

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
It's in the eye of the beholder.

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
It's whatever moves you personally.

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Or, as some people,

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
especially academics prefer,

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
beauty is in the culturally conditioned

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
eye of the beholder.

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
People agree that paintings or movies or music

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
are beautiful

56
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,820
because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts

58
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
travel across cultures

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
with great ease.

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
Beethoven is adored in Japan.

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
in British museums,

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
while Shakespeare is translated

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
into every major language of the Earth.

66
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Or just think about American jazz

67
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
or American movies --

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
they go everywhere.

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
There are many differences among the arts,

70
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
but there are also universal,

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
and values.

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
How can we explain

74
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
this universality?

75
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct

76
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
a Darwinian evolutionary history

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
We need to reverse-engineer

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
our present artistic tastes and preferences

80
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
and explain how they came

81
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
to be engraved in our minds

82
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
by the actions of both our prehistoric,

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
largely pleistocene environments,

84
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
where we became fully human,

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
but also by the social situations

86
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
in which we evolved.

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
This reverse engineering

88
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
can also enlist help

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
from the human record

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
preserved in prehistory.

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.

92
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
And it should take into account

93
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
what we know of the aesthetic interests

94
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
of isolated hunter-gatherer bands

95
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Now, I personally

97
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
have no doubt whatsoever

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
that the experience of beauty,

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
with its emotional intensity and pleasure,

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
belongs to our evolved human psychology.

101
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
The experience of beauty is one component

102
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
Beauty is an adaptive effect,

104
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
which we extend

105
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
and intensify

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
in the creation and enjoyment

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
of works of art and entertainment.

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
As many of you will know,

109
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.

110
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
The first of these is natural selection --

111
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
that's random mutation and selective retention --

112
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --

113
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.

114
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Natural selection also explains

115
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
many basic revulsions,

116
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,

117
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
or fears, such as the fear of snakes

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.

119
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Natural selection also explains pleasures --

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
sexual pleasure,

121
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,

122
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,

123
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
from ripe fruits through chocolate malts

124
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
and barbecued ribs.

125
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
The other great principle of evolution

126
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
is sexual selection,

127
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
and it operates very differently.

128
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
The peacock's magnificent tail

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,820
is the most famous example of this.

130
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
It did not evolve for natural survival.

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
In fact, it goes against natural survival.

132
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
No, the peacock's tail

133
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
results from the mating choices

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
made by peahens.

135
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
It's quite a familiar story.

136
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
It's women who actually push history forward.

137
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
Darwin himself, by the way,

138
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
had no doubts that the peacock's tail

139
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.

140
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
He actually used that word.

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,

142
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
we can say that the experience of beauty

143
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
is one of the ways that evolution has

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
of arousing and sustaining

145
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
interest or fascination,

146
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
even obsession,

147
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
in order to encourage us

148
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
toward making the most adaptive decisions

149
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
for survival and reproduction.

150
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Beauty is nature's way

151
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
of acting at a distance,

152
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
so to speak.

153
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
I mean, you can't expect to eat

154
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
an adaptively beneficial landscape.

155
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
It would hardly do to eat your baby

156
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
or your lover.

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
So evolution's trick

158
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
is to make them beautiful,

159
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
to have them exert a kind of magnetism

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.

161
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,

162
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
the magnetic pull

163
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
of beautiful landscapes.

164
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
People in very different cultures

165
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
all over the world

166
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
tend to like a particular kind of landscape,

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
a landscape that just happens to be similar

168
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

169
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
This landscape shows up today

170
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
on calendars, on postcards,

171
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
in the design of golf courses and public parks

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
and in gold-framed pictures

173
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
that hang in living rooms

174
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
from New York to New Zealand.

175
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape

176
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
featuring open spaces

177
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
of low grasses

178
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
interspersed with copses of trees.

179
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
The trees, by the way, are often preferred

180
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
if they fork near the ground,

181
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up

182
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
if you were in a tight fix.

183
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
The landscape shows the presence

184
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
of water directly in view,

185
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
or evidence of water in a bluish distance,

186
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,820
indications of animal or bird life

187
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
as well as diverse greenery

188
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
and finally -- get this --

189
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
a path

190
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
or a road,

191
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,

192
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
that extends into the distance,

193
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
almost inviting you to follow it.

194
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,

195
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
even by people in countries

196
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
that don't have it.

197
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
The ideal savanna landscape

198
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
is one of the clearest examples

199
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
where human beings everywhere

200
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
find beauty

201
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
in similar visual experience.

202
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
But, someone might argue,

203
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
that's natural beauty.

204
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
How about artistic beauty?

205
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?

206
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
No, I don't think it is.

207
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory

208
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
to say something about it.

209
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
It is widely assumed

210
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
that the earliest human artworks

211
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings

212
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
that we all know from Lascaux

213
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
and Chauvet.

214
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Chauvet caves

215
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
are about 32,000 years old,

216
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
along with a few small, realistic sculptures

217
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
of women and animals from the same period.

218
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
But artistic and decorative skills

219
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,820
are actually much older than that.

220
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Beautiful shell necklaces

221
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,

222
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
as well as ochre body paint,

223
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
have been found

224
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
from around 100,000 years ago.

225
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts

226
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
are older even than this.

227
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
I have in mind

228
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
The oldest stone tools are choppers

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.

231
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.

232
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
These crude tools

233
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
were around for thousands of centuries,

234
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
until around 1.4 million years ago

235
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
when Homo erectus

236
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
started shaping

237
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
single, thin stone blades,

238
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
sometimes rounded ovals,

239
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
but often in what are to our eyes

240
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf

241
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
or teardrop form.

242
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
These Acheulian hand axes --

243
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
they're named after St. Acheul in France,

244
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
where finds were made in 19th century --

245
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
have been unearthed in their thousands,

246
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,

247
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
almost everywhere Homo erectus

248
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
and Homo ergaster roamed.

249
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes

250
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
shows that they can't have been made

251
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
for butchering animals.

252
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
And the plot really thickens when you realize

253
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
that, unlike other pleistocene tools,

254
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
the hand axes often exhibit

255
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
no evidence of wear

256
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
on their delicate blade edges.

257
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
And some, in any event, are too big

258
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
to use for butchery.

259
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Their symmetry, their attractive materials

260
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
and, above all,

261
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
their meticulous workmanship

262
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
are simply quite beautiful

263
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
to our eyes, even today.

264
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
So what were these ancient --

265
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,

266
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
but they're at the same time

267
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
somehow familiar.

268
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
What were these artifacts for?

269
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
The best available answer

270
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
is that they were literally

271
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
the earliest known works of art,

272
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
practical tools transformed

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
into captivating aesthetic objects,

274
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
contemplated both for their elegant shape

275
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.

276
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Hand axes mark

277
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
an evolutionary advance in human history --

278
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
tools fashioned to function

279
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --

280
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
that is to say, displays

281
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
that are performances

282
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
like the peacock's tail,

283
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
except that, unlike hair and feathers,

284
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
the hand axes are consciously

285
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
cleverly crafted.

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Competently made hand axes

287
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
indicated desirable personal qualities --

288
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
intelligence, fine motor control,

289
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
planning ability,

290
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
conscientiousness

291
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
and sometimes access to rare materials.

292
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Over tens of thousands of generations,

293
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
such skills increased the status

294
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
of those who displayed them

295
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
and gained a reproductive advantage

296
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
over the less capable.

297
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
You know, it's an old line,

298
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
but it has been shown to work --

299
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"

300
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
(Laughter)

301
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Except, of course, what's interesting about this

302
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,

303
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
because the Homo erectus

304
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
that made these objects

305
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
did not have language.

306
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
It's hard to grasp,

307
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
but it's an incredible fact.

308
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
This object was made

309
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
by a hominid ancestor,

310
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,

311
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
between 50,000 and 100,000 years

312
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
before language.

313
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Stretching over a million years,

314
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
the hand axe tradition

315
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,820
is the longest artistic tradition

316
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
in human and proto-human history.

317
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --

318
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
as they were then called, finally --

319
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
were doubtless finding new ways

320
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
to amuse and amaze each other

321
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
by, who knows, telling jokes,

322
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.

323
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.

324
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
For us moderns,

325
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
virtuoso technique

326
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
is used to create imaginary worlds

327
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
in fiction and in movies,

328
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
to express intense emotions

329
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
with music, painting and dance.

330
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
But still,

331
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
one fundamental trait

332
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
of the ancestral personality persists

333
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
in our aesthetic cravings:

334
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
the beauty we find

335
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
in skilled performances.

336
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
From Lascaux to the Louvre

337
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
to Carnegie Hall,

338
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
human beings

339
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
have a permanent innate taste

340
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
for virtuoso displays in the arts.

341
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
We find beauty

342
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
in something done well.

343
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window

344
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
displaying a beautifully cut

345
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
teardrop-shaped stone,

346
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
don't be so sure

347
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
it's just your culture telling you

348
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

349
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Your distant ancestors loved that shape

350
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,

351
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
even before

352
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
they could put their love into words.

353
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

354
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
No, it's deep in our minds.

355
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills

356
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
and rich emotional lives

357
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
of our most ancient ancestors.

358
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Our powerful reaction to images,

359
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,820
to the expression of emotion in art,

360
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,

361
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
will be with us and our descendants

362
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
for as long as the human race exists.

363
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Thank you.

364
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:23,820
(Applause)
