1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
What is going on

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
in this baby's mind?

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
most people, including psychologists,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
would have said that this baby was irrational,

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
illogical, egocentric --

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
or understand cause and effect.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
In the last 20 years,

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
So in some ways,

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
we think that this baby's thinking

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,820
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
Let me give you just one example of this.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
that could be going on in his mind,

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
is trying to figure out

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
And maybe the hardest thing of all

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,820
is to figure out that what other people think and feel

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Anyone who's followed politics can testify

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
to how hard that is for some people to get.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
We wanted to know

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
if babies and young children

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
could understand this really profound thing about other people.

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Now the question is: How could we ask them?

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Babies, after all, can't talk,

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
and if you ask a three year-old

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
to tell you what he thinks,

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,820
So how do we actually ask them the question?

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,820
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
one bowl of raw broccoli

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
(Laughter)

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
But then what Betty did

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
So half the time, she acted

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
just like a baby and any other sane person.

50
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
But half the time,

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.

53
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."

54
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,

55
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,820
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.

56
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
So she'd act as if what she wanted

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

61
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
"Can you give me some?"

62
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
So the question is: What would the baby give her,

63
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
what they liked or what she liked?

64
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
just barely walking and talking,

66
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.

68
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
On the other hand,

69
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time

70
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,

71
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
like they couldn't figure this out.

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
But then after they stared for a long time,

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
they would just give her the crackers,

74
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
what they thought everybody must like.

75
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

76
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies

77
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
have already discovered

78
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
this really profound fact about human nature,

79
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
that we don't always want the same thing.

80
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
to help other people get what they wanted.

82
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Even more remarkably though,

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this

84
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,820
this deep, profound fact about human nature

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.

87
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
So children both know more and learn more

88
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
than we ever would have thought.

89
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years

90
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
that's actually demonstrated it.

91
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
The question you might ask though is:

92
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Why do children learn so much?

93
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
And how is it possible for them to learn so much

94
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
in such a short time?

95
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,

96
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
they seem pretty useless.

97
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,

98
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
because we have to put so much time and energy

99
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
into just keeping them alive.

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
But if we turn to evolution

101
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
for an answer to this puzzle

102
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
of why we spend so much time

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
taking care of useless babies,

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
it turns out that there's actually an answer.

105
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
If we look across many, many different species of animals,

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
not just us primates,

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
but also including other mammals, birds,

108
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
even marsupials

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
like kangaroos and wombats,

110
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
it turns out that there's a relationship

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
between how long a childhood a species has

112
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies

113
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
and how smart and flexible they are.

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.

115
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
On one side

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
is a New Caledonian crow.

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
are incredibly smart birds.

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

120
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
And this is a bird on the cover of science

121
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

122
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
On the other hand,

123
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
we have our friend the domestic chicken.

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys

125
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
are basically as dumb as dumps.

126
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and they're not much good at doing anything else.

128
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Well it turns out that the babies,

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

130
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
They depend on their moms

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
to drop worms in their little open mouths

132
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
for as long as two years,

133
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.

134
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Whereas the chickens are actually mature

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
within a couple of months.

136
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
So childhood is the reason

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
why the crows end up on the cover of Science

138
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
and the chickens end up in the soup pot.

139
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
There's something about that long childhood

140
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
that seems to be connected

141
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
to knowledge and learning.

142
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?

143
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Well some animals, like the chicken,

144
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
seem to be beautifully suited

145
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
to doing just one thing very well.

146
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
So they seem to be beautifully suited

147
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
to pecking grain in one environment.

148
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Other creatures, like the crows,

149
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,

150
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
but they're extremely good

151
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
at learning about laws of different environments.

152
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
And of course, we human beings

153
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.

154
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies

155
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
by far than any other animal.

156
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
We're smarter, we're more flexible,

157
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
we can learn more,

158
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
we survive in more different environments,

159
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

160
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
And our babies and children are dependent on us

161
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
for much longer than the babies of any other species.

162
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
My son is 23.

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
(Laughter)

164
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And at least until they're 23,

165
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
we're still popping those worms

166
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
into those little open mouths.

167
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
All right, why would we see this correlation?

168
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,

169
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,820
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,

170
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
but it has one big disadvantage.

171
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
And that one big disadvantage

172
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
is that, until you actually do all that learning,

173
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
you're going to be helpless.

174
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you

175
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
and be saying to yourself,

176
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"

177
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
You want to know all that

178
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
before the mastodons actually show up.

179
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem

180
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
is with a kind of division of labor.

181
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.

182
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.

183
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
And then as adults,

184
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children

185
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

186
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
So one way of thinking about it

187
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
is that babies and young children

188
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
are like the research and development division of the human species.

189
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,820
So they're the protected blue sky guys

190
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,

191
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
and we're production and marketing.

192
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
We have to take all those ideas

193
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
that we learned when we were children

194
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
and actually put them to use.

195
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Another way of thinking about it

196
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
is instead of thinking of babies and children

197
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
as being like defective grownups,

198
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
we should think about them

199
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --

200
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --

201
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies

202
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,

203
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
and we're the caterpillars

204
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.

205
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --

206
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,

207
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
that's what they're for --

208
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
we might expect

209
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.

210
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
And in fact, the baby's brain

211
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
seems to be the most powerful learning computer

212
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
on the planet.

213
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.

214
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
And there's been a revolution

215
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
in our understanding of machine learning recently.

216
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

217
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,

218
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

219
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
And essentially what Bayes did

220
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
was to provide a mathematical way

221
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
using probability theory

222
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
to characterize, describe,

223
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
the way that scientists find out about the world.

224
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
So what scientists do

225
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.

226
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
They go out and test it against the evidence.

227
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.

228
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Then they test that new hypothesis

229
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
and so on and so forth.

230
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

231
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
And that mathematics is at the core

232
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

233
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
And some 10 years ago,

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,820
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

235
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
So if you want to know what's going on

236
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
underneath those beautiful brown eyes,

237
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I think it actually looks something like this.

238
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.

239
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations

240
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
with conditional probabilities that they're revising

241
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
to figure out how the world works.

242
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,820
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.

243
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,

244
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
they look extremely stupid.

245
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

246
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
So to test this we used a machine that we have

247
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
called the Blicket Detector.

248
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
This is a box that lights up and plays music

249
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
when you put some things on it and not others.

250
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
And using this very simple machine,

251
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
my lab and others have done dozens of studies

252
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
showing just how good babies are

253
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
at learning about the world.

254
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Let me mention just one

255
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.

256
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
If I showed you this detector,

257
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
you would be likely to think to begin with

258
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
that the way to make the detector go

259
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
would be to put a block on top of the detector.

260
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
But actually, this detector

261
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
works in a bit of a strange way.

262
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,

263
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,

264
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
the detector will actually activate two out of three times.

265
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,

266
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
it will only activate two out of six times.

267
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
So the unlikely hypothesis

268
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
actually has stronger evidence.

269
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
It looks as if the waving

270
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

271
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,

272
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
and we just asked them to make it go.

273
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence

274
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
to wave the object on top of the detector.

275
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

276
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.

277
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
They're just learning how to count.

278
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
But unconsciously,

279
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
they're doing these quite complicated calculations

280
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
that will give them a conditional probability measure.

281
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
And the other interesting thing

282
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
is that they're using that evidence

283
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,

284
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
that seems very unlikely to begin with.

285
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,

286
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
we've show that four year-olds are actually better

287
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis

288
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.

289
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
So in these circumstances,

290
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,

291
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
but after all, scientists also do experiments,

292
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,820
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

293
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"

294
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
or else "playing."

295
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently

296
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
that have shown this playing around

297
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
is really a kind of experimental research program.

298
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.

299
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.

300
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And what she did was show children

301
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,

302
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
and then she showed them an anomaly.

303
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
And what you'll see

304
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses

305
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
in the space of two minutes.

306
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
(Video) Boy: How about this?

307
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Same as the other side.

308
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

309
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
(Laughter)

310
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.

311
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

312
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Boy: What's making this light up.

313
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:16,820
(Laughter)

314
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I don't know.

315
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,820
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.

316
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
(Laughter)

317
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,

318
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
and this needs to be like this.

319
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.

320
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Boy: That's why.

321
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Oh.

322
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,820
(Laughter)

323
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
AG: Now this is his next idea.

324
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
He told the experimenter to do this,

325
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
to try putting it out onto the other location.

326
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Not working either.

327
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,

328
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
not here.

329
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Oh, the bottom of this box

330
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
has electricity in here,

331
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
but this doesn't have electricity.

332
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.

333
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Boy: It's lighting up.

334
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,820
So when you put four.

335
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
So you put four on this one to make it light up

336
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
and two on this one to make it light up.

337
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.

338
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Now that is a particularly --

339
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,

340
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

341
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,

342
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
what they really do is do a series of experiments.

343
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.

344
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,820
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

345
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies

346
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?

347
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,

348
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
a lot of them have said

349
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
that babies and young children were barely conscious

350
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
if they were conscious at all.

351
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
And I think just the opposite is true.

352
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

353
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

354
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
And adults' attention and consciousness

355
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
look kind of like a spotlight.

356
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
So what happens for adults

357
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
is we decide that something's relevant or important,

358
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
we should pay attention to it.

359
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to

360
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
becomes extremely bright and vivid,

361
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
and everything else sort of goes dark.

362
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.

363
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
So what happens when we pay attention

364
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,

365
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
sends a signal

366
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

367
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
more plastic, better at learning,

368
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
and shuts down activity

369
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
in all the rest of our brains.

370
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,820
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

371
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
If we look at babies and young children,

372
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
we see something very different.

373
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
I think babies and young children

374
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness

375
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
than a spotlight of consciousness.

376
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
So babies and young children are very bad

377
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,820
at narrowing down to just one thing.

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
But they're very good at taking in lots of information

379
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
from lots of different sources at once.

380
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
And if you actually look in their brains,

381
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

382
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,

383
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.

384
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
So when we say that babies and young children

385
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
are bad at paying attention,

386
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,820
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

387
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
So they're bad at getting rid

388
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
of all the interesting things that could tell them something

389
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
and just looking at the thing that's important.

390
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,

391
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
that we might expect

392
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.

393
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Well if we want to think about a way

394
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,820
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,

395
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
I think the best thing is think about cases

396
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --

397
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
when we fall in love with someone new,

398
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
or when we're in a new city for the first time.

399
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,

400
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
it expands,

401
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
so that those three days in Paris

402
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience

403
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
than all the months of being

404
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,820
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.

405
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
And by the way, that coffee,

406
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,

407
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
actually mimics the effect

408
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
of those baby neurotransmitters.

409
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
So what's it like to be a baby?

410
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
It's like being in love

411
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
in Paris for the first time

412
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
after you've had three double-espressos.

413
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
(Laughter)

414
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
That's a fantastic way to be,

415
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,820
but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.

416
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
(Laughter)

417
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Now it's good to be a grownup.

418
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

419
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
It's good to be a grownup.

420
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,820
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.

421
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort

422
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,820
into making babies think like adults do.

423
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,

424
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
to have open-mindedness, open learning,

425
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
imagination, creativity, innovation,

426
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
maybe at least some of the time

427
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
we should be getting the adults

428
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
to start thinking more like children.

429
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,820
(Applause)
