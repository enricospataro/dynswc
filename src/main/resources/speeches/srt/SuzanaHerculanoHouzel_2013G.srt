1
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,160
What is so special about the human brain?

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,372
Why is it that we study other animals

3
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,493
instead of them studying us?

4
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,291
What does a human brain have or do

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,024
that no other brain does?

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,872
When I became interested
in these questions about 10 years ago,

7
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:28,814
scientists thought they knew
what different brains were made of.

8
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:30,543
Though it was based on very little evidence,

9
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:32,730
many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,455
including the human brain,

11
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:35,755
were made in the same way,

12
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:37,257
with a number of neurons that was always

13
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:39,488
proportional to the size of the brain.

14
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,564
This means that two brains of the same size,

15
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,112
like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,

16
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,664
should have similar numbers of neurons.

17
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,460
Now, if neurons are the functional

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,363
information processing units of the brain,

19
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:53,955
then the owners of these two brains

20
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,684
should have similar cognitive abilities.

21
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,033
And yet, one is a chimp,

22
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,670
and the other is a cow.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,032
Now maybe cows have a really rich

24
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:06,285
internal mental life and are so smart

25
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:10,088
that they choose not to let us realize it,

26
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,533
but we eat them.

27
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,232
I think most people will agree

28
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:15,233
that chimps are capable of much more complex,

29
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,289
elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.

30
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:20,221
So this is a first indication that the

31
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,254
"all brains are made the same way" scenario

32
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,925
is not quite right.

33
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,271
But let's play along.

34
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,049
If all brains were made the same way

35
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,961
and you were to compare animals
with brains of different sizes,

36
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:32,143
larger brains should always have more neurons

37
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,466
than smaller brains,
and the larger the brain,

38
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:37,488
the more cognitively able its owner should be.

39
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:39,624
So the largest brain around should also be

40
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,913
the most cognitively able.

41
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:43,494
And here comes the bad news:

42
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:46,251
Our brain, not the largest one around.

43
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,806
It seems quite vexing.

44
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,541
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,

45
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,858
but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,

46
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,443
and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,

47
00:01:56,443 --> 00:02:01,181
which is why scientists used to resort to saying

48
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:03,338
that our brain must be special

49
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:06,200
to explain our cognitive abilities.

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,146
It must be really extraordinary,

51
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:11,123
an exception to the rule.

52
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:14,349
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,

53
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,224
and it could be better, for example,

54
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,335
in that it seems larger than it should be,

55
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:21,033
with a much larger cerebral cortex
than we should have

56
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,572
for the size of our bodies.

57
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,224
So that would give us extra cortex

58
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,184
to do more interesting things
than just operating the body.

59
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:28,863
That's because the size of the brain

60
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:31,196
usually follows the size of the body.

61
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:33,513
So the main reason for saying that

62
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:35,600
our brain is larger than it should be

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,372
actually comes from comparing ourselves

64
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,058
to great apes.

65
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,652
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,

66
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,073
so their brains should also be larger than ours,

67
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:46,018
but instead it's the other way around.

68
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:48,953
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.

69
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,073
The human brain also seems special

70
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,320
in the amount of energy that it uses.

71
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,069
Although it weighs only two percent of the body,

72
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,512
it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy

73
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,975
that your body requires to run per day.

74
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,328
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,

75
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,733
just to keep your brain working.

76
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,661
So the human brain is larger than it should be,

77
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,687
it uses much more energy than it should,

78
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,145
so it's special.

79
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,716
And this is where the story started to bother me.

80
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,387
In biology, we look for rules

81
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,233
that apply to all animals and to life in general,

82
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,083
so why should the rules of evolution

83
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,725
apply to everybody else but not to us?

84
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,922
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption

85
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,793
that all brains are made in the same way.

86
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,392
Maybe two brains of a similar size

87
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,983
can actually be made of
very different numbers of neurons.

88
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,590
Maybe a very large brain

89
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,430
does not necessarily have more neurons

90
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,651
than a more modest-sized brain.

91
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,660
Maybe the human brain 
actually has the most neurons

92
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,233
of any brain, regardless of its size,

93
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,327
especially in the cerebral cortex.

94
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,879
So this to me became

95
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,608
the important question to answer:

96
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,008
how many neurons does the human brain have,

97
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,530
and how does that compare to other animals?

98
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,953
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere

99
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:01,064
that we have 100 billion neurons,

100
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,150
so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues

101
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,989
if they knew where this number came from.

102
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,447
But nobody did.

103
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,900
I've been digging through the literature

104
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,958
for the original reference for that number,

105
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,741
and I could never find it.

106
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,480
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,014
the number of neurons in the human brain,

108
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:18,513
or in any other brain for that matter.

109
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:22,048
So I came up with my own way
to count cells in the brain,

110
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,156
and it essentially consists of

111
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:27,401
dissolving that brain into soup.

112
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,438
It works like this:

113
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:32,565
You take a brain, or parts of that brain,

114
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,309
and you dissolve it in detergent,

115
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,818
which destroys the cell membranes

116
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,254
but keeps the cell nuclei intact,

117
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:41,394
so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei

118
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,175
that looks like this,

119
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,448
like a clear soup.

120
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:46,339
This soup contains all the nuclei

121
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,393
that once were a mouse brain.

122
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:51,423
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,

123
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:54,321
you can agitate it and make those nuclei

124
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,292
be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,

125
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,273
so that now by looking under the microscope

126
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:02,356
at just four or five samples
of this homogeneous solution,

127
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,892
you can count nuclei, and therefore tell

128
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,571
how many cells that brain had.

129
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,196
It's simple, it's straightforward,

130
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:09,630
and it's really fast.

131
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,627
So we've used that method to count neurons

132
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,938
in dozens of different species so far,

133
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,627
and it turns out that all brains

134
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,209
are not made the same way.

135
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,396
Take rodents and primates, for instance:

136
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:22,680
In larger rodent brains, the average size

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,366
of the neuron increases,

138
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,965
so the brain inflates very rapidly

139
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,130
and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.

140
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,833
But primate brains gain neurons

141
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,292
without the average neuron becoming any larger,

142
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,817
which is a very economical way

143
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,470
to add neurons to your brain.

144
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,234
The result is that a primate brain

145
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,401
will always have more neurons than
a rodent brain of the same size,

146
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,884
and the larger the brain,

147
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:46,098
the larger this difference will be.

148
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,201
Well, what about our brain then?

149
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:49,885
We found that we have, on average,

150
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:51,670
86 billion neurons,

151
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,669
16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,

152
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,750
and if you consider that the cerebral cortex

153
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,844
is the seat of functions like

154
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:02,981
awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,

155
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:05,965
and that 16 billion is the most neurons

156
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,586
that any cortex has,

157
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:10,304
I think this is the simplest explanation

158
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,446
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

159
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:16,667
But just as important is what
the 86 billion neurons mean.

160
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,196
Because we found that the relationship

161
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,548
between the size of the brain
and its number of neurons

162
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,175
could be described mathematically,

163
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,393
we could calculate what a human brain

164
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,067
would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.

165
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,641
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons

166
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,762
would weigh 36 kilos.

167
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,395
That's not possible.

168
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,301
A brain that huge would be crushed

169
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,485
by its own weight,

170
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,072
and this impossible brain would go

171
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:43,843
in the body of 89 tons.

172
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:45,977
I don't think it looks like us.

173
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,530
So this brings us to a very important
conclusion already,

174
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,177
which is that we are not rodents.

175
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,445
The human brain is not a large rat brain.

176
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,073
Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,

177
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,293
but that's not a fair comparison to make,

178
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,382
given that we know that we are not rodents.

179
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:02,772
We are primates,

180
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,546
so the correct comparison is to other primates.

181
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:06,773
And there, if you do the math,

182
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:09,559
you find that a generic primate

183
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,489
with 86 billion neurons

184
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:14,492
would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,

185
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:16,381
which seems just right,

186
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,353
in a body of some 66 kilos,

187
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,998
which in my case is exactly right,

188
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,618
which brings us to a very unsurprising

189
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:26,587
but still incredibly important conclusion:

190
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:27,928
I am a primate.

191
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,626
And all of you are primates.

192
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,526
And so was Darwin.

193
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,466
I love to think that Darwin
would have really appreciated this.

194
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,433
His brain, like ours,

195
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,944
was made in the image of other primate brains.

196
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:43,246
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,

197
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,027
but it is not special in its number of neurons.

198
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,882
It is just a large primate brain.

199
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:50,926
I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought

200
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:53,989
that should remind us of our place in nature.

201
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:56,633
Why does it cost so much energy, then?

202
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,080
Well, other people have figured out

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,583
how much energy the human brain

204
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,990
and that of other species costs,

205
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,642
and now that we knew how many neurons

206
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,984
each brain was made of, we could do the math.

207
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,850
And it turns out that both human

208
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,673
and other brains cost about the same,

209
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:13,094
an average of six calories 
per billion neurons per day.

210
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,233
So the total energetic cost of a brain

211
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,267
is a simple, linear function

212
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,976
of its number of neurons,

213
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,159
and it turns out that the human brain

214
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,000
costs just as much energy as you would expect.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,091
So the reason why the human brain

216
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,763
costs so much energy is simply because

217
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,746
it has a huge number of neurons,

218
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,231
and because we are primates

219
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,730
with many more neurons for a given body size

220
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,252
than any other animal,

221
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:39,792
the relative cost of our brain is large,

222
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,793
but just because we're primates,
not because we're special.

223
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:43,983
Last question, then:

224
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:47,098
how did we come by this
remarkable number of neurons,

225
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,998
and in particular, if great apes

226
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:50,553
are larger than we are,

227
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:54,318
why don't they have a larger brain 
than we do, with more neurons?

228
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:56,408
When we realized how much expensive it is

229
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,741
to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,

230
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,744
maybe there's a simple reason.

231
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,427
They just can't afford the energy

232
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,377
for both a large body 
and a large number of neurons.

233
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,806
So we did the math.

234
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,406
We calculated on the one hand

235
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,347
how much energy a primate gets per day

236
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:11,697
from eating raw foods,

237
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,734
and on the other hand, how much energy

238
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,498
a body of a certain size costs

239
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:18,885
and how much energy a brain of a
certain number of neurons costs,

240
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,374
and we looked for the combinations

241
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,785
of body size and number of brain neurons

242
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,055
that a primate could afford

243
00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:26,603
if it ate a certain number of hours per day.

244
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,419
And what we found is that

245
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,131
because neurons are so expensive,

246
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:33,501
there is a tradeoff between
body size and number of neurons.

247
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:36,452
So a primate that eats eight hours per day

248
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,476
can afford at most 53 billion neurons,

249
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,203
but then its body cannot be any bigger

250
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:43,157
than 25 kilos.

251
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,858
To weigh any more than that,

252
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,627
it has to give up neurons.

253
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,280
So it's either a large body

254
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,775
or a large number of neurons.

255
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,140
When you eat like a primate,

256
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,376
you can't afford both.

257
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,340
One way out of this metabolic limitation

258
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,741
would be to spend even more hours per day eating,

259
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:01,104
but that gets dangerous,

260
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,823
and past a certain point, it's just not possible.

261
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,360
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,

262
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,283
afford about 30 billion neurons

263
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:10,249
by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,

264
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:13,365
and that seems to be about as much as they can do.

265
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,156
Nine hours of feeding per day

266
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,427
seems to be the practical limit for a primate.

267
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,218
What about us?

268
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,818
With our 86 billion neurons

269
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,853
and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,

270
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:28,414
we should have to spend over nine hours

271
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:31,989
per day every single day feeding,

272
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:34,028
which is just not feasible.

273
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,862
If we ate like a primate,

274
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:38,115
we should not be here.

275
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,242
How did we get here, then?

276
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:42,977
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy

277
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,700
as it should, and if we can't spend

278
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,374
every waking hour of the day feeding,

279
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,285
then the only alternative, really,

280
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:52,243
is to somehow get more energy

281
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:54,196
out of the same foods.

282
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,996
And remarkably, that matches exactly

283
00:10:57,996 --> 00:11:01,033
what our ancestors are believed to have invented

284
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,872
one and a half million years ago,

285
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,654
when they invented cooking.

286
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,624
To cook is to use fire

287
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:11,424
to pre-digest foods outside of your body.

288
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:14,030
Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew

289
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,593
and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,

290
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,745
so that allows them to be completely digested

291
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,181
and absorbed in your gut,

292
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,836
which makes them yield much more
energy in much less time.

293
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,325
So cooking frees time for us to do

294
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,387
much more interesting things with our day

295
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,867
and with our neurons

296
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,772
than just thinking about food,

297
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,476
looking for food, and gobbling down food

298
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,701
all day long.

299
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,200
So because of cooking, what once was

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,553
a major liability, this large,

301
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:42,586
dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,

302
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,622
could now become a major asset,

303
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,873
now that we could both afford 
the energy for a lot of neurons

304
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,379
and the time to do interesting things with them.

305
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,353
So I think this explains why the human brain

306
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:55,593
grew to become so large so fast in evolution,

307
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:59,490
all of the while remaining just a primate brain.

308
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,264
With this large brain now affordable by cooking,

309
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,177
we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,

310
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,783
agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,

311
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:09,408
electricity, refrigerators,

312
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:11,015
all of those things that nowadays

313
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:13,057
allow us to get all the energy we need

314
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,839
for the whole day in a single sitting

315
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,793
at your favorite fast food joint.

316
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,230
So what once was a solution

317
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,929
now became the problem,

318
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:28,446
and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.

319
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,002
So what is the human advantage?

320
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,505
What is it that we have

321
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,040
that no other animal has?

322
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,388
My answer is that we have the largest number

323
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,860
of neurons in the cerebral cortex,

324
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,704
and I think that's the simplest explanation

325
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,717
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

326
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,944
And what is it that we do that no other animal does,

327
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:47,913
and which I believe was fundamental

328
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,996
to allow us to reach that large,

329
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,218
largest number of neurons in the cortex?

330
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,433
In two words, we cook.

331
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,999
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.

332
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,869
And I think that's how we got to become human.

333
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:04,329
Studying the human brain changed 
the way I think about food.

334
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:05,974
I now look at my kitchen,

335
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:07,444
and I bow to it,

336
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:09,149
and I thank my ancestors for coming up

337
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:11,049
with the invention that probably made us humans.

338
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,181
Thank you very much.

339
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:19,534
(Applause)
