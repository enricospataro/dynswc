1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
in the 21st century.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
is to go back to our school days

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
when we learned how to count.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
Because what we actually count

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
truly counts.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
Let me start by telling you a little story.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
This is Van Quach.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
She changed her name to Vivian

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
because she wanted to fit in here in America.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Her first job was at an inner-city motel

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
in San Francisco as a maid.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
I happened to buy that motel

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
about three months after Vivian started working there.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
in 1987,

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
a very impractical name,

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
in the inner-city of San Francisco.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
As I spent time with Vivian,

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
in how she did her work.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
It made me question and curious:

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
How could someone actually find joy

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
in cleaning toilets for a living?

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Her job, her goal and her calling

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection

39
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,820
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
And what gave her inspiration and meaning

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
was the fact that she was taking care of people

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
who were far away from home.

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
That very human lesson,

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
more than 20 years ago,

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
served me well during the last

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
economic downturn we had.

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
San Francisco Bay Area hotels

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
went through the largest percentage revenue drop

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
in the history of American hotels.

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
so we were particularly vulnerable.

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
But also back then,

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Well, not exactly, of course not.

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
We started eating "freedom fries,"

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
and we started boycotting anything that was French.

59
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
so I started getting these letters

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
from places like Alabama and Orange County

62
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company

63
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
because they thought we were a French company.

64
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.

65
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."

67
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
(Laughter)

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
So one particular day

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,

70
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
looking for a business solution.

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up

74
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
in the self-help section very quickly.

75
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
That's where I got reacquainted with

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."

77
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
I took one psychology class in college,

78
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,820
But as I sat there for four hours,

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
I recognized something

83
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
that is true of most leaders.

84
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
One of the simplest facts in business

85
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
is something that we often neglect,

86
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
and that is that we're all human.

87
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,

88
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
has some hierarchy of needs

89
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
in the workplace.

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
So as I started reading more Maslow,

91
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
what I started to realize is that

92
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Maslow, later in his life,

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
and apply it to the collective,

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
to organizations and specifically to business.

96
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,

97
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.

98
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
So I realized in that dotcom crash

99
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And that's what I did a few years ago

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid

102
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,

103
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
which is survival, success and transformation.

104
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.

105
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
And we started asking ourselves the questions

106
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
about how we were actually addressing

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
the higher needs, these transformational needs

108
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
for our key employees in the company.

109
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
These three levels of the hierarchy needs

110
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
relate to the five levels

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

112
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,

114
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
I realized we had no metrics.

115
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.

116
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
So we started asking ourselves:

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
What kind of less obvious metrics

118
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
could we use to actually evaluate

119
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
our employees' sense of meaning,

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?

121
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
For example, we actually started asking our employees,

122
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
do they understand the mission of our company,

123
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
and do they feel like they believe in it,

124
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
can they actually influence it,

125
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?

126
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
We started asking our customers,

127
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
did they feel an emotional connection with us,

128
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
in one of seven different kinds of ways.

129
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Miraculously, as we asked these questions

130
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,

131
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
what we found is we created more loyalty.

132
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.

133
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Our employee turnover dropped

134
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
to one-third of the industry average,

135
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
and during that five year dotcom bust,

136
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
we tripled in size.

137
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,820
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there

138
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and asking them how they were getting through that time,

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
what they told me over and over again

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
was that they just manage what they can measure.

141
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
What we can measure is that tangible stuff

142
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
at the bottom of the pyramid.

143
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
They didn't even see the intangible stuff

144
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
higher up the pyramid.

145
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
So I started asking myself the question:

146
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?

147
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,

148
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,

149
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.

150
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
So I went out and studied a bunch of things,

151
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
and I found a survey that showed

152
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
that 94 percent

153
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
of business leaders worldwide

154
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,

155
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
things like intellectual property,

156
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,

157
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders

158
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.

159
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
So as leaders, we understand

160
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
that intangibles are important,

161
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.

162
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
So here's another Einstein quote:

163
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
"Not everything that can be counted counts,

164
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
and not everything that counts can be counted."

165
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
I hate to argue with Einstein,

166
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
but if that which is most valuable

167
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
in our life and our business

168
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
actually can't be counted or valued,

169
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
aren't we going to spend our lives

170
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
just mired in measuring the mundane?

171
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
It was that sort of heady question about what counts

172
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week

173
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,820
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.

174
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,820
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,

175
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
a place some folks call Shangri-La.

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid

177
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
to becoming a transformational

178
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
role model for the world.

179
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I went to Bhutan.

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,

181
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
but this was back in 1972,

182
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
when he ascended to the throne

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
two days after his father passed away.

184
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions

185
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
On a trip through India,

187
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
early in his reign as king,

188
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
he was asked by an Indian journalist

189
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
about the Bhutanese GDP,

190
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.

191
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
The king responded in a fashion

192
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
that actually has transformed us four decades later.

193
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed

194
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and focused with gross domestic product?

195
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Why don't we care more about

196
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
gross national happiness?"

197
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
an alternative definition of success,

199
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
what has come to be known as

200
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
GNH, or gross national happiness.

201
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Most world leaders didn't take notice,

202
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."

203
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
But the king was serious.

204
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
This was a notable moment,

205
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
because this was the first time a world leader

206
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
in almost 200 years

207
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
had suggested

208
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
that intangible of happiness --

209
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
that leader 200 years ago,

210
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --

211
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
200 years later,

212
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness

213
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
is something that we should measure,

214
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
and it's something we should actually value

215
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
as government officials.

216
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
For the next three dozen years as king,

217
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
this king actually started measuring

218
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --

219
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
including, just recently, taking his country

220
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy

221
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
with no bloodshed, no coup.

222
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,

223
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.

224
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,

225
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
I got to really understand what they're doing.

226
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.

227
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.

228
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
I asked him,

229
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
"How can you create and measure

230
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
something which evaporates --

231
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
in other words, happiness?"

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
And he's a very wise man, and he said,

233
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.

234
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.

235
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."

236
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Wow, that's interesting.

237
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
He said that they have a science behind that art,

238
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
and they've actually created four essential pillars,

239
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
nine key indicators

240
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
and 72 different metrics

241
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
that help them to measure their GNH.

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
One of those key indicators is:

243
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
How do the Bhutanese feel about

244
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
how they spend their time each day?

245
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
It's a good question. How do you feel about

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
how you spend your time each day?

247
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Time is one of the scarcest resources

248
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
in the modern world.

249
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
And yet, of course,

250
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
that little intangible piece of data

251
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.

252
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,

253
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I started to imagine

254
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
what I call an emotional equation.

255
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
And it focuses on something I read long ago

256
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.

257
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
How many know him? Anybody?

258
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"

259
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
and he suggested that happiness

260
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
is not about having what you want;

261
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
instead, it's about wanting what you have.

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe

263
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
happiness equals wanting what you have --

264
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
imagine gratitude --

265
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
divided by having what you want --

266
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
gratification.

267
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,

268
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
constantly focused on what they don't have.

269
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Their religion, their isolation,

270
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
their deep respect for their culture

271
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
and now the principles of their GNH movement

272
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
all have fostered a sense of gratitude

273
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
about what they do have.

274
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,

275
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
spend more of our time

276
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

277
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
We are a bottom-heavy culture

278
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
in more ways than one.

279
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
(Laughter)

280
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
The reality is, in Western countries,

281
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --

283
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.

284
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,

285
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
many dictionaries define pursuit

286
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
as to "chase with hostility."

287
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?

288
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Good question. But back to Bhutan.

289
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Bhutan's bordered on its north and south

290
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
by 38 percent of the world's population.

291
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Could this little country,

292
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
like a startup in a mature industry,

293
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
be the spark plug that influences

294
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
a 21st century

295
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
of middle-class in China and India?

296
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,

297
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
a new global currency of well-being,

298
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
and there are 40 countries around the world today

299
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
that are studying their own GNH.

300
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
You may have heard, this last fall

301
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Nicolas Sarkozy in France

302
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
announcing the results of an 18-month study

303
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
by two Nobel economists,

304
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.

305
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Sarkozy suggested that

306
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
world leaders should stop

307
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
myopically focusing on GDP

308
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
and consider a new index,

309
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."

310
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
I like it.

311
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Co-branding opportunities.

312
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,

313
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,

314
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,

315
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,

316
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968

317
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
when he suggested that we're

318
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
myopically focused on the wrong thing

319
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.

320
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.

321
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,

322
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.

323
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
This is a collection of things

324
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.

325
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
GDP counts everything from air pollution

326
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
to the destruction of our redwoods.

327
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
But it doesn't count the health of our children

328
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
or the integrity of our public officials.

329
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
As you look at these two columns here,

330
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us

331
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
to start figuring out a new way to count,

332
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
a new way to imagine

333
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
what's important to us in life?

334
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
(Applause)

335
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.

336
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
He said GDP "measures everything in short,

337
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
except that which makes life worthwhile."

338
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Wow.

339
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
So how do we do that?

340
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Let me say one thing we can just start doing

341
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
ten years from now, at least in this country.

342
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Why in the heck in America

343
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
are we doing a census in 2010?

344
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.

345
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.

346
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
But all of those questions are tangible.

347
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
They're about demographics.

348
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
and whether you own your home or not.

350
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
That's about it.

351
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
We're not asking meaningful metrics.

352
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
We're not asking important questions.

353
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
We're not asking anything that's intangible.

354
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Abe Maslow said long ago

355
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.

356
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,

357
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
everything starts to look like a nail."

358
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
We've been fooled by our tool.

359
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Excuse that expression.

360
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
(Laughter)

361
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
We've been fooled by our tool.

362
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
GDP has been our hammer.

363
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century

364
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
industrial-era model of success.

365
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
And yet, 64 percent

366
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
of the world's GDP today

367
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
is in that intangible industry we call service,

368
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
the service industry, the industry I'm in.

369
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries

370
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
of manufacturing and agriculture.

371
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?

372
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that

373
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,

374
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
but actually counts what we most value,

375
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
the things that are intangible.

376
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.

377
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.

378
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
I learned that economists measure everything

379
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
in tangible units of production and consumption

380
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
as if each of those tangible units

381
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
is exactly the same.

382
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
They aren't the same.

383
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn

384
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
is that we can influence

385
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
the quality of that unit of production

386
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
by creating the conditions

387
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
for our employees to live their calling.

388
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
In Vivian's case,

389
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
her unit of production

390
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
isn't the tangible hours she works,

391
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
it's the intangible difference she makes

392
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
during that one hour of work.

393
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually

394
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.

395
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
He stayed there a hundred times

396
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
in the last 20 years,

397
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship

398
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.

399
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.

400
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
He tells me that he can always count

401
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
on Vivian and the staff there

402
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
to make him feel at home.

403
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Why is it that

404
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
business leaders and investors

405
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,820
quite often don't see the connection

406
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
between creating the intangible

407
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
of employee happiness

408
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
with creating the tangible

409
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,820
of financial profits in their business?

410
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
We don't have to choose between

411
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,820
inspired employees and sizable profits,

412
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
we can have both.

413
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
In fact, inspired employees quite often

414
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
help make sizable profits, right?

415
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
So what the world needs now,

416
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
in my opinion,

417
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
is business leaders and political leaders

418
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
who know what to count.

419
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
We count numbers.

420
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
We count on people.

421
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers

422
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
to truly take into account our people.

423
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I learned that from a maid in a motel

424
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
and a king of a country.

425
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
What can you

426
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
start counting today?

427
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
What one thing can you start counting today

428
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
that actually would be meaningful in your life,

429
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
whether it's your work life or your business life?

430
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Thank you very much.

431
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:27,820
(Applause)
