1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
There's a medical revolution happening all around us,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
and it's one that's going to help us conquer

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
some of society's most dreaded conditions,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
including cancer.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
The revolution is called angiogenesis,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and it's based on the process

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
So why should we care about blood vessels?

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Well, the human body is literally packed with them:

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
End to end, that would form a line

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,820
that would circle the earth twice.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,820
The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries;

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
we've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
And these are the vessels of life, and,

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
as I'll show you,

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
they can also be the vessels of death.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Now the remarkable thing about blood vessels

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
is that they have this ability

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
For example, in the liver they form channels

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
to detoxify the blood;

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange;

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
without cutting off circulation;

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and in nerves they course along like power lines,

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
keeping those nerves alive.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
We get most of these blood vessels

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
when we're actually still in the womb,

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
And what that means is that as adults,

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
blood vessels don't normally grow.

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Except in a few special circumstances:

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
In women, blood vessels grow every month

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
to build the lining of the uterus;

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,820
during pregnancy, they form the placenta,

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
which connects mom and baby.

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
And after injury, blood vessels

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
actually have to grow under the scab

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
in order to heal a wound.

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
And this is actually what it looks like,

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
hundreds of blood vessels

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
all growing toward the center of the wound.

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
So the body has the ability to regulate

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
It does this through an elaborate

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
and elegant system of checks and balances,

48
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
such that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
the body can do this by releasing stimulators,

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
proteins called angiogenic factors

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
that act as natural fertilizer

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
And when those excess vessels are no longer needed,

55
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
the body prunes them back to baseline

56
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels --

59
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
for example, after an injury --

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
and a body can do that too,

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
but only to that normal level,

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
that set point.

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
But what we now know is that for a number of diseases,

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
there are defects in the system

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels

66
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
or can't grow enough new ones

67
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
in the right place at the right time.

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
And in these situations, angiogenesis

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
is out of balance.

70
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
And when angiogenesis is out of balance,

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
a myriad of diseases result.

72
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
For example, insufficient angiogenesis --

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
not enough blood vessels --

74
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
leads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
legs without circulation, death from stroke,

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
nerve damage.

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
And on the other end, excessive angiogenesis --

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
too many blood vessels -- drives disease,

79
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
and we see this in cancer, blindness,

80
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
arthritis, obesity,

81
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Alzheimer's disease.

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
In total, there are more than 70 major diseases

83
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
affecting more than a billion people worldwide,

84
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
that all look on the surface to be different from one another,

85
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
but all actually share

86
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
abnormal angiogenesis

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
as their common denominator.

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And this realization is allowing us

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
to reconceptualize

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
the way that we actually approach these diseases

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
by controlling angiogenesis.

92
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
Now I'm going to focus on cancer

93
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,820
because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer,

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
every type of cancer.

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
So here we go.

96
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass

97
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
growing inside a brain.

98
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
And under the microscope, you can see

99
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels,

100
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,

101
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
bringing oxygen and nutrients.

102
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
But cancers don't start out like this.

103
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
And, in fact, cancers don't start out

104
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
with a blood supply.

105
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
They start out as small, microscopic nests of cells

106
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
that can only grow to

107
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,820
one half a cubic millimeter in size;

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
that's the tip of a ballpoint pen.

109
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,

110
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients.

111
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
In fact, we're probably forming these

112
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
microscopic cancers all the time in our body.

113
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents

114
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,820
have shown that about 40 percent of women

115
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
between the ages of 40 and 50

116
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
actually have microscopic

117
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
cancers in their breasts,

118
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
about 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s

119
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
have microscopic prostate cancers,

120
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
and virtually 100 percent of us,

121
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
by the time we reach our 70s,

122
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.

123
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Yet, without a blood supply,

124
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
most of these cancers

125
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
will never become dangerous.

126
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor

127
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,

128
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
once called this "cancer without disease."

129
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis,

130
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
when it's working properly,

131
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.

132
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
And this turns out to be

133
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
one of our most important defense mechanisms

134
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
against cancer.

135
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
In fact, if you actually block angiogenesis

136
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,

137
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
tumors simply can't grow up.

138
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
But once angiogenesis occurs,

139
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
cancers can grow exponentially.

140
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
And this is actually how

141
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
a cancer goes from being

142
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
harmless to deadly.

143
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Cancer cells mutate

144
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
and they gain the ability to release

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
lots of those angiogenic factors, natural fertilizer,

146
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels

147
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
invading the cancer.

148
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
And once those vessels invade the cancer,

149
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
it can expand, it can invade local tissues.

150
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
And the same vessels that are feeding tumors

151
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation

152
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
as metastases.

153
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
And, unfortunately, this late stage of cancer

154
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
is the one at which it's most likely

155
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
to be diagnosed,

156
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
when angiogenesis is already turned on

157
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
and cancer cells are growing like wild.

158
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
So, if angiogenesis

159
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
is a tipping point

160
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
between a harmless cancer and a harmful one,

161
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution

162
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
is a new approach to treating cancer

163
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
by cutting off the blood supply.

164
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
We call this antiangiogenic therapy,

165
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
and it's completely different from chemotherapy

166
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
because it selectively aims

167
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.

168
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And we can do this because

169
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
tumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
we see in other places of the body:

171
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
They're abnormal;

172
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
they're very poorly constructed;

173
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
and, because of that, they're highly vulnerable

174
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
to treatments that target them.

175
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
In effect, when we give cancer patients

176
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
antiangiogenic therapy --

177
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
here, an experimental drug for a glioma,

178
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
which is a type of brain tumor --

179
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur

180
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
when the tumor is being starved.

181
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Here's a woman with a breast cancer

182
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,

183
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
which is FDA approved.

184
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
And you can see that the halo of blood flow

185
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
disappears after treatment.

186
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Well, I've just shown you

187
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
two very different types of cancer

188
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.

189
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
So, a few years ago, I asked myself,

190
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
"Can we take this one step further

191
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and treat other cancers,

192
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
even in other species?"

193
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
So here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo

194
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
who had a very aggressive tumor

195
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.

196
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
It invaded into his lungs.

197
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
His veterinarian only gave him three months to live.

198
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs

199
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
that could be mixed into his dog food

200
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
as well as an antiangiogenic cream

201
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
that could be applied on the surface of the tumor.

202
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
And within a few weeks of treatment,

203
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
we were able to slow down that cancer's growth

204
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
such that we were ultimately able to extend milo's survival

205
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,820
to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,

206
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
all with a very good quality of life.

207
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.

208
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
We have about a 60 percent response rate

209
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
and improved survival for these pets

210
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
that were about to be euthanized.

211
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
So let me show you a couple of

212
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
even more interesting examples.

213
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
This is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,

214
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
and she had these lesions in her mouth

215
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
that, over the course of three years,

216
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
developed into invasive squamous cell cancers.

217
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.

218
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
We had it painted on top of the cancer

219
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
three times a week.

220
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
And over the course of seven months,

221
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
the cancers completely disappeared,

222
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
and the biopsies came back as normal.

223
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Here's a cancer growing on the lip

224
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
of a Wuarter horse named Guinness.

225
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
It's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.

226
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
It had already spread to his lymph nodes,

227
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip

228
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
and an oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside

229
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
as well as the outside.

230
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
And over the course of six months,

231
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
he experienced a complete remission.

232
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
And here he is six years later,

233
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Guinness, with his very happy owner.

234
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
(Applause)

235
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Now, obviously, antiangiogenic therapy

236
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
could be used for a wide range of cancers.

237
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
And, in fact, the first pioneering treatments

238
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
for people, as well as dogs,

239
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
are already becoming available.

240
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
There's 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.

241
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
But the real question is:

242
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
How well do these work in practice?

243
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
So here's actually the patient survival data

244
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
from eight different types of cancer.

245
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
The bars represent survival time

246
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
taken from the era

247
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
in which there was only chemotherapy,

248
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
or surgery, or radiation available.

249
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
But starting in 2004,

250
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
when antiangiogenic therapies first became available,

251
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
well you can see that there has been

252
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
a 70 to 100 percent

253
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
improvement in survival

254
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
for people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,

255
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

256
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
That's impressive.

257
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
But for other tumors and cancer types,

258
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
the improvements have only been modest.

259
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
So I started asking myself,

260
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
"Why haven't we been able to do better?"

261
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
And the answer, to me, is obvious;

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
we're treating cancer too late in the game,

263
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
when it's already established

264
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
and, oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.

265
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
And as a doctor, I know

266
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,

267
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
achieving a cure

268
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
can be difficult, if not impossible.

269
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
So I went back to the biology

270
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
of angiogenesis

271
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and started thinking:

272
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Could the answer to cancer

273
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
be preventing angiogenesis,

274
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
beating cancer at its own game

275
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
so the cancers could never become dangerous?

276
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
This could help healthy people

277
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
as well as people who've already beaten cancer

278
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
once or twice

279
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
and want to find a way to keep it from coming back.

280
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer,

281
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I went back to look at cancer's causes.

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
And what really intrigued me

283
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
was when I saw that diet

284
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
accounts for 30 to 35 percent

285
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
of environmentally caused cancers.

286
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Now, the obvious thing is to think about

287
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
what we could remove from our diet, what to strip out, take away.

288
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
But I actually took a completely opposite approach

289
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
and began asking: What could we be adding to our diet

290
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
that's naturally antiangiogenic,

291
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
that could boost the body's defense system

292
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?

293
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
In other words, can we eat to starve cancer? (Laughter)

294
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Well, the answer's yes,

295
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
and I'm going to show you how.

296
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Our search for this

297
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
has taken us to the market, the farm and to the spice cabinet,

298
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
because what we've discovered

299
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
is that mother nature has laced a large number

300
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
of foods and beverages and herbs

301
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
with naturally occurring inhibitors

302
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
of angiogenesis.

303
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
So here's a test system we developed.

304
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels

305
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
are growing out in a starburst fashion.

306
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
And we can use this system

307
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
to test dietary factors

308
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
at concentrations that are obtainable by eating.

309
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
So let me show you what happens when we put in

310
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
an extract from red grapes.

311
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
The active ingredient's resveratrol,

312
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
it's also found in red wine.

313
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis

314
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
by 60 percent.

315
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries;

316
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
it potently inhibits angiogenesis.

317
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
And extract from soybeans.

318
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
And here is a growing list of our

319
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
antiangiogenic foods and beverages

320
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
that we're interested in studying.

321
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
For each food type,

322
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
we believe that there are different potencies

323
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
within different strains and varietals.

324
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
And we want to measure this because,

325
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
well, while you're eating a strawberry

326
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
or drinking tea,

327
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
why not select the one that's most potent

328
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
for preventing cancer.

329
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
So here are four different teas that we've tested.

330
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
They're all common ones:

331
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,

332
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared.

333
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
And you can see clearly

334
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
that the teas vary in their potency

335
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
from less potent to more potent.

336
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
But what's very cool

337
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
is when we actually combined the two

338
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
less potent teas together,

339
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
the combination, the blend,

340
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
is more potent than either one alone.

341
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
This means there's food synergy.

342
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Here's some more data from our testing.

343
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Now, in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis

344
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
represented here in a black bar.

345
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,820
And using this system, we can test the potency of cancer drugs.

346
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
So the shorter the bar,

347
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
less angiogenesis, that's good.

348
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
And here are some common drugs

349
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
that have been associated with reducing the risk

350
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
of cancer in people.

351
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

352
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
and a few others,

353
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
they inhibit angiogenesis too.

354
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And here are the dietary factors

355
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
going head to head against these drugs.

356
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
You can see, they clearly hold their own

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and, in some cases, they're more potent

358
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
than the actual drugs.

359
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Soy, parsley, garlic,

360
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
grapes, berries;

361
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
I could go home and cook a tasty meal

362
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
using these ingredients.

363
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
So imagine if we could create

364
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
the world's first rating system

365
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
in which we could score foods

366
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
according to their antiangiogenic,

367
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
cancer-preventative properties.

368
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
And that's what we're doing right now.

369
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,

370
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
and so the real question is:

371
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
What is the evidence in people

372
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
that eating certain foods can reduce

373
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,820
angiogenesis in cancer?

374
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Well, the best example I know

375
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
is a study of 79,000 men

376
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
followed over 20 years,

377
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
in which it was found that men who consumed

378
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
cooked tomatoes two to three times a week

379
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
had up to a 50 percent reduction

380
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
in their risk of developing prostate cancer.

381
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Now, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,

382
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
and lycopene is antiangiogenic.

383
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
But what's even more interesting from this study

384
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,

385
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
those who ate more servings of tomato sauce

386
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
actually had fewer blood vessels

387
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
feeding their cancer.

388
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
So this human study is a prime example

389
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
of how antiangiogenic substances

390
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
present in food and consumed at practical levels

391
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
can impact on cancer.

392
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
And we're now studying

393
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
the role of a healthy diet

394
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University

395
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis

396
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
that we can find in the bloodstream.

397
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Now, obviously, what I've shared with you has some far-ranging implications,

398
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
even beyond cancer research.

399
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Because if we're right, it could impact on consumer education,

400
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
food services, public health

401
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and even the insurance industry.

402
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
And, in fact, some insurance companies

403
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
are already beginning to think along these lines.

404
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota.

405
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
And for many people around the world,

406
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
dietary cancer prevention

407
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
may be the only practical solution

408
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments,

409
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
but everybody could benefit from

410
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
a healthy diet based on local, sustainable,

411
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
antiangiogenic crops.

412
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Now, finally,

413
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
I've talked to you about food,

414
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
and I've talked to you about cancer,

415
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about

416
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
and that's obesity.

417
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Because it turns out that

418
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
adipose tissue, fat,

419
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
is highly angiogenesis dependent.

420
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
And, like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.

421
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
So the question is: Can we shrink fat

422
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
by cutting off its blood supply?

423
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
So the top curve shows the body weight

424
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
of a genetically obese mouse

425
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
that eats nonstop

426
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
until it turns fat, like this furry tennis ball.

427
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.

428
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
If you take the obese mouse and give it

429
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.

430
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.

431
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Restart the treatment, loses the weight again.

432
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Stop the treatment, it gains the weight back.

433
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
And, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down

434
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.

435
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention

436
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
may also have an application

437
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
for obesity.

438
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
The really, truly interesting thing about this

439
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
is that we can't take these obese mice

440
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
and make them lose more weight

441
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.

442
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
In other words, we can't create supermodel mice.

443
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
(Laughter)

444
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis

445
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,820
in regulating healthy set points.

446
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that,

447
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,820
"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,

448
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
and thinking what no one has thought."

449
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I hope I've convinced you

450
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
that, for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,

451
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
that there may be a great power

452
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
in attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.

453
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
And that's what I think the world needs now. Thank you.

454
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:18,820
(Applause)

455
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
June Cohen: I have a quick question for you. So these drugs aren't exactly ...

456
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
they're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now.

457
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
For anyone out here who has cancer,

458
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
what would you recommend?

459
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?

460
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
William Li: So there are antiangiogenic treatments

461
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
that are FDA approved,

462
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
and if you're a cancer patient

463
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
or working for one or advocating for one,

464
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
you should ask about them.

465
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,820
And there are many clinical trials.

466
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,

467
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
and there are about 100 more

468
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
drugs in that pipeline.

469
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
So consider the approved ones,

470
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
look for clinical trials,

471
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
but then between what the doctor can do for you,

472
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.

473
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
And this is one of the themes that I'm talking about

474
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
is we can empower ourselves to do the things

475
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
that doctors can't do for us,

476
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
which is to use knowledge and take action.

477
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
And if Mother Nature has given us some clues,

478
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
we think that there might be a new future

479
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
in the value of how we eat.

480
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
And what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.

481
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
JC: Right. And along those lines,

482
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
for people who might have risk factors for cancer,

483
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically

484
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
or simply pursuing the right diet

485
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
with lots of tomato sauce?

486
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
WL: Well, you know, there's abundant epidemiological evidence.

487
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
And I think in the information age,

488
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
it doesn't take long to go to a credible source

489
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
like PubMed, the National Library of Medicine,

490
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
to look for epidemiological studies

491
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
for cancer risk reduction

492
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
based on diet and based on common medications.

493
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
And that's certainly something that anybody can look into.

494
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.

495
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
(Applause)
