1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
what exactly autism is.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
Autism is a very big continuum

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal --

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And I actually feel at home here,

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
because there's a lot of autism genetics here.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
You wouldn't have any...

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,820
(Applause)

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
It's a continuum of traits.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
When does a nerd turn into

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Asperger, which is just mild autism?

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I mean, Einstein and Mozart

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
as autistic spectrum today.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,820
getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
the next energy things,

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,820
you know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning.

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
OK. Now, if you want to understand

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
autism, animals.

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,820
You have to get away from verbal language.

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
I think in pictures,

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
I don't think in language.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Now, the thing about the autistic mind

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
is it attends to details.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
OK, this is a test where you either have to

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
pick out the big letters, or pick out the little letters,

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
and the autistic mind picks out the

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
little letters more quickly.

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
because it will fall down if you ignore the details.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,820
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
is things are getting too abstract.

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
People are getting away from doing

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
hands-on stuff.

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
the hands-on classes,

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
because art, and classes like that,

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
those are the classes where I excelled.

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
In my work with cattle,

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
would make the cattle balk. Like, for example,

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
this flag waving, right in front of the veterinary facility.

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility;

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
all they needed to do was move the flag.

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Rapid movement, contrast.

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
In the early '70s when I started, I got right down

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing.

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk,

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
shadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor ...

54
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
people weren't noticing these things --

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
a chain hanging down --

56
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
and that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
In fact, I loved the movie, how they

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side.

59
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
My drawings got to star in the movie too.

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
And actually it's called "Temple Grandin,"

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
not "Thinking In Pictures."

62
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
So, what is thinking in pictures? It's literally movies

63
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
in your head.

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
My mind works like Google for images.

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Now, when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different.

66
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
I thought everybody thought in pictures.

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And then when I did my book, "Thinking In Pictures,"

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I start interviewing people about how they think.

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
And I was shocked to find out that

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
my thinking was quite different. Like if I say,

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
"Think about a church steeple"

72
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
most people get this sort of generalized generic one.

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Now, maybe that's not true in this room,

74
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
but it's going to be true in a lot of different places.

75
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
I see only specific pictures.

76
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.

77
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
And in the movie, they've got a great scene in there

78
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,820
where the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
pop into my imagination.

80
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
OK, there is my childhood church,

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
that's specific. There's some more, Fort Collins.

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
OK, how about famous ones?

83
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
And they just kind of come up, kind of like this.

84
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Just really quickly, like Google for pictures.

85
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And they come up one at a time,

86
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
and then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow,

87
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
or we can have a thunderstorm,"

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Now, visual thinking was a tremendous asset

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
in my work designing cattle-handling facilities.

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And I've worked really hard on improving

92
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant.

93
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it.

95
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,820
But, one of the things that I was able to do in my design work

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
is I could actually test run

97
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
a piece of equipment in my mind,

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
just like a virtual reality computer system.

99
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
And this is an aerial view

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie.

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
That was like just so super cool.

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types

103
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
and autism types working out there on the movie set too.

104
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
(Laughter)

105
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
But one of the things that really worries me

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
is: Where's the younger version of those kids going today?

107
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley, where they belong.

108
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
(Laughter)

109
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,820
(Applause)

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Now, one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social,

111
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,820
is I had to sell my work, and not myself.

112
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
And the way I sold livestock jobs

113
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things.

114
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Another thing that helped me as a little kid

115
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.

116
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves

117
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
in the store and throw it around.

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Now, when kids get to be in third or fourth grade,

119
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker,

120
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
drawing in perspective. Now, I want to

121
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
emphasize that not every autistic kid

122
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
is going to be a visual thinker.

123
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago,

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
and I used to joke around about having a

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
gigantic Internet trunk line

126
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
going deep into my visual cortex.

127
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
This is tensor imaging.

128
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
And my great big internet trunk line

129
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
is twice as big as the control's.

130
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
The red lines there are me,

131
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,820
and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.

132
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
And there I got a gigantic one,

133
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and the control over there, the blue one,

134
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,820
has got a really small one.

135
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
And some of the research now is showing

136
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex.

137
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind.

138
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind --

139
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
good at one thing, bad at something else.

140
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
to take geometry or trig.

142
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Gigantic mistake: I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra,

143
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
go right to geometry and trig.

144
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.

145
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
More abstract. These are your engineers,

146
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
your computer programmers.

147
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Now, this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis

148
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
is made from a single sheet of paper --

149
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
no scotch tape, no cuts.

150
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it.

151
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Here are the types of thinking:

152
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;

153
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
pattern thinkers, music and math minds.

154
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading.

155
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
You also will see these kind of problems

156
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
with kids that are dyslexic.

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
You'll see these different kinds of minds.

158
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.

159
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,820
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.

161
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
And I came in half an hour beforehand

162
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it,

163
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.

164
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights;

165
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
others have problems with sound sensitivity.

166
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
You know, it's going to be variable.

167
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
into the animal mind.

169
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,820
Because think about it: An animal is a sensory-based thinker,

170
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
not verbal -- thinks in pictures,

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.

172
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant.

173
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
He knows who's been there, when they were there.

174
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Are they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.

176
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,820
It's all very detailed information,

177
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
and, looking at these kind of details

178
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
gave me a lot of insight into animals.

179
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,

180
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
puts sensory-based information

181
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
into categories.

182
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
Man on a horse

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
and a man on the ground --

184
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
that is viewed as two totally different things.

185
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.

186
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian

187
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
and with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.

188
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up

189
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground,

190
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,820
with the veterinarian, but a person can ride him.

191
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
Cattle are the same way.

192
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Man on a horse,

193
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
a man on foot -- they're two different things.

194
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
You see, it's a different picture.

195
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
See, I want you to think about just how specific this is.

196
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Now, this ability to put information into categories,

197
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
I find a lot of people are not very good at this.

198
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment

199
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
or problems with something in a plant,

200
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,820
they don't seem to be able to figure out, "Do I have a training people issue?

201
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment?"

202
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
In other words, categorize equipment problem

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
from a people problem.

204
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.

205
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Now, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem.

206
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Is it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?

207
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Or is the whole design of the system wrong?

208
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
People have a hard time figuring that out.

209
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Let's just look at something like, you know,

210
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
solving problems with making airlines safer.

211
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.

212
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
I do lots and lots of flying,

213
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and if I was at the FAA,

214
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,820
what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?

215
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
It would be their airplane tails.

216
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years,

217
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,820
the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
in some way.

219
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
It's tails, pure and simple.

220
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? They can't see

221
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
that stuff inside the tail.

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
You know, now as I think about that,

223
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm pulling up all of that specific information.

224
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
It's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up.

225
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid

227
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
of black cowboy hats.

228
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.

229
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.

230
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Now, the thing is, the world is going to need

231
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
all of the different kinds of minds

232
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
to work together.

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.

234
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy,

235
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
as I travel around and I do autism meetings,

236
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids,

237
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
and they just aren't very social,

238
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
and nobody's working on developing their interest

239
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
in something like science.

240
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.

241
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.

242
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I was a goofball student. When I was in high school

243
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,820
I just didn't care at all about studying,

244
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.

245
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.

246
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And he got me challenged

247
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
to figure out an optical illusion room.

248
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids

249
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
interesting stuff.

250
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do

251
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED,

252
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet

253
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
to get these kids turned on.

254
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids,

255
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
and the teachers out in the Midwest, and the other parts of the country,

256
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
when you get away from these tech areas,

257
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
they don't know what to do with these kids.

258
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And they're not going down the right path.

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
The thing is, you can make a mind

260
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,

261
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
or your mind can be wired to be more social.

262
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
And what some of the research now has shown in autism

263
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
is there may by extra wiring back here,

264
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
in the really brilliant mind, and we lose a few social circuits here.

265
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,820
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.

266
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
And then you can get into the point where it's so severe

267
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.

268
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
In the normal human mind

269
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.

270
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.

271
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
And he studied Alzheimer's patients

272
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.

273
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain,

274
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,820
and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars.

275
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics,

276
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
but I think it's very interesting

277
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
that there was some work done to show that

278
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
this eddy pattern in this painting

279
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
followed a statistical model of turbulence,

280
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
which brings up the whole interesting idea

281
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
of maybe some of this mathematical patterns

282
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
is in our own head.

283
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
And the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking

284
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
notes and I was writing down all the

285
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
search words I could use,

286
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.

287
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff.

288
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
And they've taken out the autoshop class

289
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
and the drafting class and the art class.

290
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
I mean art was my best subject in school.

291
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds,

292
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds,

293
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
because we absolutely are going to need

294
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
these kind of people in the future.

295
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
And let's talk about jobs.

296
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
OK, my science teacher got me studying

297
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
because I was a goofball that didn't want to study.

298
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
But you know what? I was getting work experience.

299
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things,

300
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
like how to be on time.

301
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I was taught that when I was eight years old.

302
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
You know, how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.

303
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I was taught that when I was very, very young.

304
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop

305
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
sewing clothes.

306
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
I did internships in college,

307
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I was building things,

308
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and I also had to learn how to do assignments.

309
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,820
You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.

310
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
My mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else."

311
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
They've got to learn how to do something else.

312
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.

313
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Let's get him working on building different things.

314
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
The thing about the autistic mind

315
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
is it tends to be fixated.

316
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Like if a kid loves racecars,

317
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
let's use racecars for math.

318
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance.

319
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
In other words, use that fixation

320
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
in order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do.

321
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers,

322
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,820
especially when you get away from this part of the country,

323
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
they don't know what to do with these smart kids.

324
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
It just drives me crazy.

325
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up?

326
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
photography, industrial design.

328
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
The pattern thinkers, they're the ones that are going to be

329
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
your mathematicians, your software engineers,

330
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,820
your computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs.

331
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists,

332
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and they also make really, really good stage actors.

333
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Because the thing about being autistic is,

334
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
I had to learn social skills like being in a play.

335
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
It's just kind of -- you just have to learn it.

336
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
And we need to be working with these students.

337
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
And this brings up mentors.

338
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.

339
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
He was a NASA space scientist.

340
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Now, some states now are getting it to where

341
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
if you have a degree in biology, or a degree in chemistry,

342
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.

343
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
We need to be doing that.

344
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Because what I'm observing is

345
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
the good teachers, for a lot of these kids,

346
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
are out in the community colleges,

347
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools.

348
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Another thing that can be very, very, very successful is

349
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
there is a lot of people that may have retired

350
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,820
from working in the software industry, and they can teach your kid.

351
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old,

352
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.

353
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
You're getting that kid turned on.

354
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
And you get him turned on, then he'll learn all the new stuff.

355
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Mentors are just essential.

356
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
I cannot emphasize enough

357
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
what my science teacher did for me.

358
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.

359
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies,

360
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind,

361
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say, "Design new software."

362
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific:

363
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
"Well, we're designing a software for a phone

364
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
and it has to do some specific thing.

365
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
And it can only use so much memory."

366
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
That's the kind of specificity you need.

367
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Well, that's the end of my talk.

368
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
And I just want to thank everybody for coming.

369
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
It was great to be here.

370
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:06,820
(Applause)

371
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Oh, you've got a question for me? OK.

372
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
(Applause)

373
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much for that.

374
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote,

375
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
"If by some magic, autism had been

376
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,820
eradicated from the face of the Earth,

377
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,820
then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire

378
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
at the entrance to a cave."

379
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spears?

380
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
The Asperger guy. And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics

381
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
there would be no more Silicon Valley,

382
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
and the energy crisis would not be solved.

383
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
(Applause)

384
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
CA: So, I want to ask you a couple other questions,

385
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
and if any of these feel inappropriate,

386
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
it's okay just to say, "Next question."

387
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
But if there is someone here

388
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
who has an autistic child,

389
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
or knows an autistic child

390
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
and feels kind of cut off from them,

391
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
what advice would you give them?

392
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
TG: Well, first of all, you've got to look at age.

393
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
If you have a two, three or four year old

394
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
you know, no speech, no social interaction,

395
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I can't emphasize enough:

396
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Don't wait, you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.

397
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,820
You know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees.

398
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum

399
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
that are not going to learn to talk, and they're not going to be working

400
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Silicon Valley, that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.

401
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
But then you get the smart, geeky kids

402
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
that have a touch of autism,

403
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
and that's where you've got to get them turned on

404
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
with doing interesting things.

405
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
I got social interaction through shared interest.

406
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,820
I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,

407
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
did electronics lab with other kids,

408
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
and in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors

409
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show.

410
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
That was like, we considered that super cool.

411
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
CA: Is it unrealistic for them

412
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
to hope or think that that child

413
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820
loves them, as some might, as most, wish?

414
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
TG: Well let me tell you, that child will be loyal,

415
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.

416
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
CA: Wow. So, most people, if you ask them

417
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
what are they most passionate about, they'd say things like,

418
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,820
"My kids" or "My lover."

419
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
What are you most passionate about?

420
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
TG: I'm passionate about that the things I do

421
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
are going to make the world a better place.

422
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
When I have a mother of an autistic child say,

423
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
"My kid went to college because of your book,

424
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
or one of your lectures," that makes me happy.

425
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
You know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them

426
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
in the '80s; they were absolutely awful.

427
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants

428
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down?

429
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
How many cattle got poked with the prodder?

430
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
How many cattle are mooing their heads off?

431
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
And it's very, very simple.

432
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You directly observe a few simple things.

433
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of

434
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
seeing stuff that makes real change

435
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
in the real world. We need a lot more of that,

436
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
and a lot less abstract stuff.

437
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,820
(Applause)

438
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
CA: When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said that

439
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
really astonished me was you said one thing

440
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,820
you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that.

441
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
TG: Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that,

442
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
it contains knowledge.

443
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
It's libraries.

444
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
And to me, knowledge is something

445
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
that is extremely valuable. So, maybe, over 10 years ago

446
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
now our library got flooded.

447
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
And this is before the Internet got really big.

448
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked,

449
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
because it was knowledge being destroyed.

450
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
And server farms, or data centers

451
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
are great libraries of knowledge.

452
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
CA: Temple, can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED.

453
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
TG: Well thank you so much. Thank you.

454
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:34,820
(Applause)
