1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
This is a photograph

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
by the artist Michael Najjar,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
and it's real,

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
in the sense that he went there to Argentina

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
to take the photo.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And what he's done

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
is he's actually reshaped, digitally,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
all of the contours of the mountains

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
So what you see,

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
that precipice, that high precipice with the valley,

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
is the 2008 financial crisis.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
The photo was made

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
when we were deep in the valley over there.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,820
I don't know where we are now.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,820
This is the Hang Seng index

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
for Hong Kong.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
And similar topography.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
I wonder why.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
And this is art. This is metaphor.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
But I think the point is

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
that this is metaphor with teeth,

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
that we rethink a little bit

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
about the role of contemporary math --

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
not just financial math, but math in general.

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
That its transition

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
from being something that we extract and derive from the world

30
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
to something that actually starts to shape it --

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
the world around us and the world inside us.

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
And it's specifically algorithms,

33
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
which are basically the math

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
that computers use to decide stuff.

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
They acquire the sensibility of truth

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
because they repeat over and over again,

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and they ossify and calcify,

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
and they become real.

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
And I was thinking about this, of all places,

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
because I happened to be seated

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
next to a Hungarian physicist about my age

43
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
and we were talking

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
about what life was like during the Cold War

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
for physicists in Hungary.

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
And I said, "So what were you doing?"

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
And I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
How does that work?"

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
And to understand that,

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.

52
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
And so -- this is an over-simplification --

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
but basically, it's not like

54
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
you can just pass a radar signal

55
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
It's not just going to disappear.

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
But if you can take this big, massive thing,

58
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
and you could turn it into

59
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,820
a million little things --

60
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
something like a flock of birds --

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
well then the radar that's looking for that

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
has to be able to see

63
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
every flock of birds in the sky.

64
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,820
And if you're a radar, that's a really bad job.

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,820
And he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
So we didn't use a radar;

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
electronic communication.

69
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,

70
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
And I said, "Yeah.

72
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
That's good.

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
So you've effectively negated

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
60 years of aeronautic research.

75
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
What's your act two?

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
What do you do when you grow up?"

77
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And he said,

78
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
"Well, financial services."

79
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
And I said, "Oh."

80
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Because those had been in the news lately.

81
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And I said, "How does that work?"

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
And he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,

83
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
and I'm one of them."

84
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
And I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"

85
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
And he said, "It's funny you ask that,

86
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
because it's actually called black box trading.

87
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
And it's also sometimes called algo trading,

88
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
algorithmic trading."

89
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And algorithmic trading evolved in part

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
because institutional traders have the same problems

91
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
that the United States Air Force had,

92
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,820
which is that they're moving these positions --

93
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
whether it's Proctor & Gamble or Accenture, whatever --

94
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
they're moving a million shares of something

95
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
through the market.

96
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
And if they do that all at once,

97
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
it's like playing poker and going all in right away.

98
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
You just tip your hand.

99
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
And so they have to find a way --

100
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
and they use algorithms to do this --

101
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
to break up that big thing

102
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
into a million little transactions.

103
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
And the magic and the horror of that

104
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
is that the same math

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
that you use to break up the big thing

106
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
into a million little things

107
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
can be used to find a million little things

108
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
and sew them back together

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
and figure out what's actually happening in the market.

110
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
So if you need to have some image

111
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820
of what's happening in the stock market right now,

112
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms

113
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
that are basically programmed to hide,

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.

115
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
And all of that's great, and it's fine.

116
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And that's 70 percent

117
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
of the United States stock market,

118
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
70 percent of the operating system

119
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
formerly known as your pension,

120
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
your mortgage.

121
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And what could go wrong?

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
What could go wrong

123
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
is that a year ago,

124
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,

125
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.

126
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,

127
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and nobody to this day

128
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
can even agree on what happened

129
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,820
because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.

130
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening.

131
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
All they had

132
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
was just a monitor in front of them

133
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
that had the numbers on it

134
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and just a red button

135
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
that said, "Stop."

136
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
And that's the thing,

137
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
is that we're writing things,

138
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
we're writing these things that we can no longer read.

139
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
And we've rendered something

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
illegible,

141
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
and we've lost the sense

142
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
of what's actually happening

143
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
in this world that we've made.

144
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
And we're starting to make our way.

145
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
There's a company in Boston called Nanex,

146
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
and they use math and magic

147
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
and I don't know what,

148
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
and they reach into all the market data

149
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.

150
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
And when they find them they pull them out

151
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.

152
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
And they do what we've always done

153
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand --

154
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
which is that they give them a name

155
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
and a story.

156
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
So this is one that they found,

157
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
they called the Knife,

158
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
the Carnival,

159
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,820
the Boston Shuffler,

160
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Twilight.

161
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
And the gag is

162
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,820
that, of course, these aren't just running through the market.

163
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look,

164
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
once you learn how to look for them.

165
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
You can find it here: this book about flies

166
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
that you may have been looking at on Amazon.

167
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
You may have noticed it

168
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
when its price started at 1.7 million dollars.

169
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
It's out of print -- still ...

170
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
(Laughter)

171
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.

172
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
A few hours later, it had gone up

173
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
to 23.6 million dollars,

174
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
plus shipping and handling.

175
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
And the question is:

176
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?

177
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
And you see this behavior on Amazon

178
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
as surely as you see it on Wall Street.

179
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And when you see this kind of behavior,

180
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
what you see is the evidence

181
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
of algorithms in conflict,

182
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
algorithms locked in loops with each other,

183
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
without any human oversight,

184
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
without any adult supervision

185
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."

186
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,820
(Laughter)

187
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
And as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.

188
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
And so Netflix has gone through

189
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
several different algorithms over the years.

190
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others --

191
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.

192
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.

193
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,

194
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
trying to do the same thing.

195
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
It's trying to get a grasp on you,

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
on the firmware inside the human skull,

197
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
so that it can recommend what movie

198
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
you might want to watch next --

199
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
which is a very, very difficult problem.

200
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
But the difficulty of the problem

201
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
and the fact that we don't really quite have it down,

202
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
it doesn't take away

203
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.

204
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,

205
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
determines, in the end,

206
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
60 percent

207
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
of what movies end up being rented.

208
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
So one piece of code

209
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
with one idea about you

210
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
is responsible for 60 percent of those movies.

211
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
But what if you could rate those movies

212
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
before they get made?

213
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Wouldn't that be handy?

214
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,

215
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
and they have "story algorithms" --

216
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
a company called Epagogix.

217
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
And you can run your script through there,

218
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
and they can tell you, quantifiably,

219
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
that that's a 30 million dollar movie

220
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
or a 200 million dollar movie.

221
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
And the thing is, is that this isn't Google.

222
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
This isn't information.

223
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
These aren't financial stats; this is culture.

224
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
And what you see here,

225
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
or what you don't really see normally,

226
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,820
is that these are the physics of culture.

227
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
And if these algorithms,

228
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
like the algorithms on Wall Street,

229
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
just crashed one day and went awry,

230
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
how would we know?

231
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
What would it look like?

232
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
And they're in your house. They're in your house.

233
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
These are two algorithms competing for your living room.

234
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
These are two different cleaning robots

235
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
that have very different ideas about what clean means.

236
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
And you can see it

237
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
if you slow it down and attach lights to them,

238
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
And the idea that architecture itself

240
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization

241
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
is not far-fetched.

242
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
It's super-real and it's happening around you.

243
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
You feel it most

244
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
when you're in a sealed metal box,

245
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
a new-style elevator;

246
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
they're called destination-control elevators.

247
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to

248
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
before you get in the elevator.

249
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.

250
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
So none of this mishegas

251
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
of letting everybody go into whatever car they want.

252
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,

253
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.

254
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
And the problem with that

255
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
is that people freak out.

256
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
People panic.

257
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
And you see why. You see why.

258
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
It's because the elevator

259
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
is missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.

260
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
(Laughter)

261
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Like the things that people use.

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
All it has

263
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
is just the number that moves up or down

264
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
and that red button that says, "Stop."

265
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And this is what we're designing for.

266
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
We're designing

267
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
for this machine dialect.

268
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
And how far can you take that? How far can you take it?

269
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
You can take it really, really far.

270
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
So let me take it back to Wall Street.

271
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Because the algorithms of Wall Street

272
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
are dependent on one quality above all else,

273
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
which is speed.

274
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.

275
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,

276
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
it takes you 500,000 microseconds

277
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
just to click a mouse.

278
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm

279
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
and you're five microseconds behind,

280
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
you're a loser.

281
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
So if you were an algorithm,

282
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt

283
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
who was hollowing out a skyscraper --

284
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,

285
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,820
and just running steel on the floors

286
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --

287
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
all so an algorithm

288
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
could get close to the Internet.

289
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.

290
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.

291
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
In New York, this is where it's distributed from:

292
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
the Carrier Hotel

293
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
located on Hudson Street.

294
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city.

295
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,820
And the reality is that the further away you are from that,

296
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
you're a few microseconds behind every time.

297
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
These guys down on Wall Street,

298
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation,

299
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
they're eight microseconds

300
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
behind all these guys

301
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,820
going into the empty buildings being hollowed out

302
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
up around the Carrier Hotel.

303
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
And that's going to keep happening.

304
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
We're going to keep hollowing them out,

305
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
because you, inch for inch

306
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
and pound for pound and dollar for dollar,

307
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space

308
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
like the Boston Shuffler could.

309
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
But if you zoom out,

310
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
if you zoom out,

311
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
you would see an 825-mile trench

312
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
between New York City and Chicago

313
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
that's been built over the last few years

314
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
by a company called Spread Networks.

315
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
This is a fiber optic cable

316
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
that was laid between those two cities

317
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
to just be able to traffic one signal

318
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
37 times faster than you can click a mouse --

319
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
just for these algorithms,

320
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
just for the Carnival and the Knife.

321
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
And when you think about this,

322
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
that we're running through the United States

323
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
with dynamite and rock saws

324
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
so that an algorithm can close the deal

325
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
three microseconds faster,

326
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
all for a communications framework

327
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
that no human will ever know,

328
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
that's a kind of manifest destiny;

329
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
and we'll always look for a new frontier.

330
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Unfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.

331
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
This is just theoretical.

332
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
This is some mathematicians at MIT.

333
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
And the truth is I don't really understand

334
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
a lot of what they're talking about.

335
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement,

336
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
and I don't really understand any of that.

337
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
But I can read this map,

338
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
and what this map says

339
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,

340
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
that's where people are, where the cities are,

341
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are

342
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
to do that most effectively.

343
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots

344
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.

345
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,

346
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
or platforms.

347
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
We'll actually part the water

348
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
to pull money out of the air,

349
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
because it's a bright future

350
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
if you're an algorithm.

351
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
(Laughter)

352
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
And it's not the money that's so interesting actually.

353
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
It's what the money motivates,

354
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
that we're actually terraforming

355
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
the Earth itself

356
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
with this kind of algorithmic efficiency.

357
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And in that light,

358
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
you go back

359
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,

360
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.

361
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
They're prophecy

362
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,820
for the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects

363
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
of the math that we're making.

364
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
And the landscape was always made

365
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration

366
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
between nature and man.

367
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,820
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms --

368
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.

369
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
And we will have to understand those as nature,

370
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
and in a way, they are.

371
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Thank you.

372
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:12,820
(Applause)
