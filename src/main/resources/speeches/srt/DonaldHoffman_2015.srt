1
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,721
I love a great mystery,

2
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:19,133
and I'm fascinated by the greatest
unsolved mystery in science,

3
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,091
perhaps because it's personal.

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,359
It's about who we are,

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,476
and I can't help but be curious.

6
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,095
The mystery is this:

7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,530
What is the relationship
between your brain

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,041
and your conscious experiences,

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,711
such as your experience
of the taste of chocolate

10
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,485
or the feeling of velvet?

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,209
Now, this mystery is not new.

12
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:44,418
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,

13
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:49,712
"How it is that anything so remarkable
as a state of consciousness comes about

14
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,079
as the result of irritating nervous tissue

15
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,145
is just as unaccountable

16
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:59,198
as the appearance of the genie
when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."

17
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,365
Now, Huxley knew that brain activity

18
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,639
and conscious experiences are correlated,

19
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,798
but he didn't know why.

20
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:12,119
To the science of his day,
it was a mystery.

21
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,255
In the years since Huxley,

22
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,621
science has learned a lot
about brain activity,

23
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,642
but the relationship
between brain activity

24
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:22,730
and conscious experiences
is still a mystery.

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,375
Why? Why have we made so little progress?

26
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:31,234
Well, some experts think
that we can't solve this problem

27
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:35,033
because we lack the necessary
concepts and intelligence.

28
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,772
We don't expect monkeys to solve
problems in quantum mechanics,

29
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:43,937
and as it happens, we can't expect
our species to solve this problem either.

30
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:47,481
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.

31
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,523
I think we've simply
made a false assumption.

32
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:54,029
Once we fix it, we just
might solve this problem.

33
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,446
Today, I'd like tell you
what that assumption is,

34
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:59,204
why it's false, and how to fix it.

35
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,388
Let's begin with a question:

36
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:04,686
Do we see reality as it is?

37
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:06,381
I open my eyes

38
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:11,318
and I have an experience that I describe
as a red tomato a meter away.

39
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,669
As a result, I come to believe
that in reality,

40
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,311
there's a red tomato a meter away.

41
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,435
I then close my eyes, and my experience
changes to a gray field,

42
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:29,411
but is it still the case that in reality,
there's a red tomato a meter away?

43
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,733
I think so, but could I be wrong?

44
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:38,331
Could I be misinterpreting
the nature of my perceptions?

45
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:42,371
We have misinterpreted
our perceptions before.

46
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,830
We used to think the Earth is flat,
because it looks that way.

47
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,406
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.

48
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:53,418
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of the Universe,

49
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,326
again because it looks that way.

50
00:02:56,226 --> 00:03:01,132
Copernicus and Galileo discovered,
again, that we were wrong.

51
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:05,220
Galileo then wondered if we might
be misinterpreting our experiences

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,728
in other ways.

53
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:11,737
He wrote: "I think that tastes,
odors, colors, and so on

54
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,741
reside in consciousness.

55
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,863
Hence if the living creature were removed,
all these qualities would be annihilated."

56
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,614
Now, that's a stunning claim.

57
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,815
Could Galileo be right?

58
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:29,413
Could we really be misinterpreting
our experiences that badly?

59
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,974
What does modern science
have to say about this?

60
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:37,748
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that about a third of the brain's cortex

61
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,606
is engaged in vision.

62
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,112
When you simply open your eyes
and look about this room,

63
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:47,384
billions of neurons
and trillions of synapses are engaged.

64
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:48,992
Now, this is a bit surprising,

65
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,633
because to the extent that
we think about vision at all,

66
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,470
we think of it as like a camera.

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,410
It just takes a picture
of objective reality as it is.

68
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,110
Now, there is a part of vision
that's like a camera:

69
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,749
the eye has a lens that focuses
an image on the back of the eye

70
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:10,139
where there are 130 million
photoreceptors,

71
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,039
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

72
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,522
But that doesn't explain
the billions of neurons

73
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:21,144
and trillions of synapses
that are engaged in vision.

74
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,443
What are these neurons up to?

75
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,650
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that they are creating, in real time,

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,980
all the shapes, objects, colors,
and motions that we see.

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,471
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot
of this room the way it is,

78
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:39,046
but in fact, we're constructing
everything that we see.

79
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,227
We don't construct
the whole world at once.

80
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,992
We construct what we need in the moment.

81
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:48,729
Now, there are many demonstrations
that are quite compelling

82
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,540
that we construct what we see.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,583
I'll just show you two.

84
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:58,349
In this example, you see some red discs
with bits cut out of them,

85
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,290
but if I just rotate
the disks a little bit,

86
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,027
suddenly, you see a 3D cube
pop out of the screen.

87
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,860
Now, the screen of course is flat,

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,460
so the three-dimensional cube
that you're experiencing

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,437
must be your construction.

90
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,130
In this next example,

91
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,354
you see glowing blue bars
with pretty sharp edges

92
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,538
moving across a field of dots.

93
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,665
In fact, no dots move.

94
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:33,286
All I'm doing from frame to frame
is changing the colors of dots

95
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:35,747
from blue to black or black to blue.

96
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,581
But when I do this quickly,

97
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:41,296
your visual system creates
the glowing blue bars

98
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,967
with the sharp edges and the motion.

99
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,637
There are many more examples,
but these are just two

100
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,400
that you construct what you see.

101
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,775
But neuroscientists go further.

102
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:58,316
They say that we reconstruct reality.

103
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,542
So, when I have an experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

104
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:06,675
that experience is actually
an accurate reconstruction

105
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,790
of the properties of a real red tomato

106
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,085
that would exist
even if I weren't looking.

107
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,636
Now, why would neuroscientists
say that we don't just construct,

108
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,516
we reconstruct?

109
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:21,047
Well, the standard argument given

110
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,601
is usually an evolutionary one.

111
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,200
Those of our ancestors
who saw more accurately

112
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,053
had a competitive advantage compared
to those who saw less accurately,

113
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,809
and therefore they were more likely
to pass on their genes.

114
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:38,200
We are the offspring of those
who saw more accurately,

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,969
and so we can be confident that,
in the normal case,

116
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:43,500
our perceptions are accurate.

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,195
You see this in the standard textbooks.

118
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:49,189
One textbook says, for example,

119
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,160
"Evolutionarily speaking,

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,203
vision is useful precisely
because it is so accurate."

121
00:06:55,203 --> 00:07:00,001
So the idea is that accurate perceptions
are fitter perceptions.

122
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:02,145
They give you a survival advantage.

123
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,060
Now, is this correct?

124
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,719
Is this the right interpretation
of evolutionary theory?

125
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,100
Well, let's first look at a couple
of examples in nature.

126
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,058
The Australian jewel beetle

127
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,169
is dimpled, glossy and brown.

128
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,514
The female is flightless.

129
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:22,531
The male flies, looking,
of course, for a hot female.

130
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:26,479
When he finds one, he alights and mates.

131
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,950
There's another species in the outback,

132
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,284
Homo sapiens.

133
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,351
The male of this species
has a massive brain

134
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:37,299
that he uses to hunt for cold beer.

135
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:38,988
(Laughter)

136
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,362
And when he finds one, he drains it,

137
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,752
and sometimes throws the bottle
into the outback.

138
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:49,000
Now, as it happens, these bottles
are dimpled, glossy,

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,140
and just the right shade of brown
to tickle the fancy of these beetles.

140
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:58,055
The males swarm all over
the bottles trying to mate.

141
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:02,189
They lose all interest
in the real females.

142
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,392
Classic case of the male
leaving the female for the bottle.

143
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,339
(Laughter) (Applause)

144
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,593
The species almost went extinct.

145
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:18,572
Australia had to change its bottles
to save its beetles.

146
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:21,572
(Laughter)

147
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:25,780
Now, the males had successfully
found females for thousands,

148
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,218
perhaps millions of years.

149
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:32,652
It looked like they saw reality
as it is, but apparently not.

150
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:35,509
Evolution had given them a hack.

151
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,245
A female is anything dimpled,
glossy and brown,

152
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:42,521
the bigger the better.

153
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,355
(Laughter)

154
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:49,195
Even when crawling all over the bottle,
the male couldn't discover his mistake.

155
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:53,410
Now, you might say, beetles, sure,
they're very simple creatures,

156
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,268
but surely not mammals.

157
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,985
Mammals don't rely on tricks.

158
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:03,998
Well, I won't dwell on this,
but you get the idea. (Laughter)

159
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:07,156
So this raises an important
technical question:

160
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:13,147
Does natural selection really favor
seeing reality as it is?

161
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:17,233
Fortunately, we don't have
to wave our hands and guess;

162
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:20,414
evolution is a mathematically
precise theory.

163
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:23,967
We can use the equations of evolution
to check this out.

164
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,120
We can have various organisms
in artificial worlds compete

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,073
and see which survive and which thrive,

166
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,626
which sensory systems are more fit.

167
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:37,711
A key notion in those
equations is fitness.

168
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,406
Consider this steak:

169
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:44,738
What does this steak do
for the fitness of an animal?

170
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:51,274
Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,
it enhances fitness.

171
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:56,593
For a well-fed lion looking to mate,
it doesn't enhance fitness.

172
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:01,744
And for a rabbit in any state,
it doesn't enhance fitness,

173
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:05,868
so fitness does depend
on reality as it is, yes,

174
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:10,056
but also on the organism,
its state and its action.

175
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,609
Fitness is not the same thing
as reality as it is,

176
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,092
and it's fitness,
and not reality as it is,

177
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:21,271
that figures centrally
in the equations of evolution.

178
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,462
So, in my lab,

179
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:28,237
we have run hundreds of thousands
of evolutionary game simulations

180
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,302
with lots of different
randomly chosen worlds

181
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:35,481
and organisms that compete
for resources in those worlds.

182
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:39,800
Some of the organisms
see all of the reality,

183
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,689
others see just part of the reality,

184
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,794
and some see none of the reality,

185
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,560
only fitness.

186
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,640
Who wins?

187
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,075
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but perception of reality goes extinct.

188
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,984
In almost every simulation,

189
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:58,166
organisms that see none of reality

190
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,256
but are just tuned to fitness

191
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:05,480
drive to extinction all the organisms
that perceive reality as it is.

192
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,070
So the bottom line is, evolution
does not favor vertical,

193
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,726
or accurate perceptions.

194
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:15,488
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.

195
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,508
Now, this is a bit stunning.

196
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:21,190
How can it be that not seeing
the world accurately

197
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,010
gives us a survival advantage?

198
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,123
That is a bit counterintuitive.

199
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,958
But remember the jewel beetle.

200
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,719
The jewel beetle survived
for thousands, perhaps millions of years,

201
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,413
using simple tricks and hacks.

202
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,590
What the equations
of evolution are telling us

203
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:42,233
is that all organisms, including us, 
are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.

204
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,163
We do not see reality as it is.

205
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:48,435
We're shaped with tricks
and hacks that keep us alive.

206
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,455
Still,

207
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,522
we need some help with our intuitions.

208
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:57,305
How can not perceiving
reality as it is be useful?

209
00:11:57,305 --> 00:12:00,974
Well, fortunately, we have
a very helpful metaphor:

210
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,806
the desktop interface on your computer.

211
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,939
Consider that blue icon
for a TED Talk that you're writing.

212
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,943
Now, the icon is blue and rectangular

213
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,324
and in the lower right corner
of the desktop.

214
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:19,330
Does that mean that the text file itself
in the computer is blue,

215
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,775
rectangular, and in the lower
right-hand corner of the computer?

216
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,098
Of course not.

217
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:29,807
Anyone who thought that misinterprets
the purpose of the interface.

218
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:32,575
It's not there to show you
the reality of the computer.

219
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:35,500
In fact, it's there to hide that reality.

220
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,375
You don't want to know about the diodes

221
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,625
and resistors and all
the megabytes of software.

222
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,756
If you had to deal with that,
you could never write your text file

223
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,231
or edit your photo.

224
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,948
So the idea is that evolution
has given us an interface

225
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:53,263
that hides reality and guides
adaptive behavior.

226
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:56,281
Space and time, as you
perceive them right now,

227
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,455
are your desktop.

228
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:03,192
Physical objects are simply icons
in that desktop.

229
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,233
There's an obvious objection.

230
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:10,181
Hoffman, if you think that train
coming down the track at 200 MPH

231
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,642
is just an icon of your desktop,

232
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,767
why don't you step in front of it?

233
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,060
And after you're gone,
and your theory with you,

234
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,374
we'll know that there's more
to that train than just an icon.

235
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:22,417
Well, I wouldn't step
in front of that train

236
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,973
for the same reason

237
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:28,268
that I wouldn't carelessly drag
that icon to the trash can:

238
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:31,449
not because I take the icon literally --

239
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,454
the file is not literally blue
or rectangular --

240
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,080
but I do take it seriously.

241
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,111
I could lose weeks of work.

242
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,665
Similarly, evolution has shaped us

243
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:46,101
with perceptual symbols
that are designed to keep us alive.

244
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:49,096
We'd better take them seriously.

245
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,301
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.

246
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,970
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.

247
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,546
They're designed to keep us safe,
and we should take them seriously.

248
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,237
That does not mean that we
should take them literally.

249
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,491
That's a logical error.

250
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:06,696
Another objection: There's
nothing really new here.

251
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:10,620
Physicists have told us for a long time
that the metal of that train looks solid

252
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,008
but really it's mostly empty space
with microscopic particles zipping around.

253
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:16,496
There's nothing new here.

254
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,700
Well, not exactly.

255
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,740
It's like saying, I know that
that blue icon on the desktop

256
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,039
is not the reality of the computer,

257
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,498
but if I pull out my trusty
magnifying glass and look really closely,

258
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,309
I see little pixels,

259
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,770
and that's the reality of the computer.

260
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,578
Well, not really -- you're still
on the desktop, and that's the point.

261
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,574
Those microscopic particles
are still in space and time:

262
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,965
they're still in the user interface.

263
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,727
So I'm saying something far more radical
than those physicists.

264
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,020
Finally, you might object,

265
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,579
look, we all see the train,

266
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,621
therefore none of us constructs the train.

267
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:55,711
But remember this example.

268
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,427
In this example, we all see a cube,

269
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,510
but the screen is flat,

270
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,247
so the cube that you see
is the cube that you construct.

271
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,599
We all see a cube

272
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:12,458
because we all, each one of us,
constructs the cube that we see.

273
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,518
The same is true of the train.

274
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:19,000
We all see a train because
we each see the train that we construct,

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,553
and the same is true
of all physical objects.

276
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:29,216
We're inclined to think that perception
is like a window on reality as it is.

277
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:34,220
The theory of evolution is telling us
that this is an incorrect interpretation

278
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,685
of our perceptions.

279
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:40,459
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop

280
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,756
that's designed to hide
the complexity of the real world

281
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,622
and guide adaptive behavior.

282
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:49,030
Space as you perceive it is your desktop.

283
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,056
Physical objects are just
the icons in that desktop.

284
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,946
We used to think that the Earth is flat
because it looks that way.

285
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,474
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of reality

286
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,198
because it looks that way.

287
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,340
We were wrong.

288
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,010
We had misinterpreted our perceptions.

289
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,139
Now we believe that spacetime and objects

290
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,753
are the nature of reality as it is.

291
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:17,197
The theory of evolution is telling us
that once again, we're wrong.

292
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:22,236
We're misinterpreting the content
of our perceptual experiences.

293
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:24,767
There's something that exists
when you don't look,

294
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,170
but it's not spacetime
and physical objects.

295
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,198
It's as hard for us to let go
of spacetime and objects

296
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,681
as it is for the jewel beetle
to let go of its bottle.

297
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:39,099
Why? Because we're blind
to our own blindnesses.

298
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,576
But we have an advantage
over the jewel beetle:

299
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:44,364
our science and technology.

300
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:46,755
By peering through the lens of a telescope

301
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,391
we discovered that the Earth
is not the unmoving center of reality,

302
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:54,269
and by peering through the lens
of the theory of evolution

303
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,591
we discovered that spacetime and objects

304
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,959
are not the nature of reality.

305
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,244
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

306
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:06,181
I am interacting with reality,

307
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:11,391
but that reality is not a red tomato
and is nothing like a red tomato.

308
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:16,792
Similarly, when I have an experience
that I describe as a lion or a steak,

309
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm interacting with reality,

310
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,798
but that reality is not a lion or a steak.

311
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,818
And here's the kicker:

312
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,508
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a brain, or neurons,

313
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:30,598
I am interacting with reality,

314
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:34,127
but that reality is not a brain or neurons

315
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,625
and is nothing like a brain or neurons.

316
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:42,404
And that reality, whatever it is,

317
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:46,015
is the real source of cause and effect

318
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:50,047
in the world -- not brains, not neurons.

319
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,647
Brains and neurons
have no causal powers.

320
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:55,248
They cause none of our
perceptual experiences,

321
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,036
and none of our behavior.

322
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:02,412
Brains and neurons are a species-specific
set of symbols, a hack.

323
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,093
What does this mean
for the mystery of consciousness?

324
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:09,736
Well, it opens up new possibilities.

325
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,431
For instance,

326
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:18,410
perhaps reality is some vast machine
that causes our conscious experiences.

327
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,080
I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.

328
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,429
Perhaps reality is some vast,
interacting network of conscious agents,

329
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:33,002
simple and complex, that cause
each other's conscious experiences.

330
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:36,252
Actually, this isn't as crazy
an idea as it seems,

331
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,872
and I'm currently exploring it.

332
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:40,478
But here's the point:

333
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:43,799
Once we let go of our massively intuitive

334
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,723
but massively false assumption
about the nature of reality,

335
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:52,111
it opens up new ways to think
about life's greatest mystery.

336
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:57,680
I bet that reality will end up
turning out to be more fascinating

337
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,654
and unexpected than we've ever imagined.

338
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:06,042
The theory of evolution presents us
with the ultimate dare:

339
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:11,184
Dare to recognize that perception
is not about seeing truth,

340
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:15,280
it's about having kids.

341
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,020
And by the way, even this TED
is just in your head.

342
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,064
Thank you very much.

343
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:25,452

344
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:36,041
Chris Anderson: If that's
really you there, thank you.

345
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,972
So there's so much from this.

346
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:42,241
I mean, first of all, some people
may just be profoundly depressed

347
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:47,790
at the thought that,
if evolution does not favor reality,

348
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,120
I mean, doesn't that to some extent
undermine all our endeavors here,

349
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,804
all our ability to think
that we can think the truth,

350
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:57,310
possibly even including
your own theory, if you go there?

351
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,764
Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not
stop us from a successful science.

352
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,576
What we have is one theory
that turned out to be false,

353
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:09,035
that perception is like reality
and reality is like our perceptions.

354
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,720
That theory turns out to be false.

355
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,138
Okay, throw that theory away.

356
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:15,392
That doesn't stop us from now postulating
all sorts of other theories

357
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:16,750
about the nature of reality,

358
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,355
so it's actually progress to recognize
that one of our theories was false.

359
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:23,013
So science continues as normal.
There's no problem here.

360
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,614
CA: So you think it's possible
-- (Laughter) --

361
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:29,724
This is cool, but what you're saying
I think is it's possible that evolution

362
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:32,371
can still get you to reason.

363
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,684
DH: Yes. Now that's a very,
very good point.

364
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:39,211
The evolutionary game simulations that I
showed were specifically about perception,

365
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:41,789
and they do show that our perceptions
have been shaped

366
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,669
not to show us reality as it is,

367
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,942
but that does not mean the same thing
about our logic or mathematics.

368
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:51,564
We haven't done these simulations,
but my bet is that we'll find

369
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:55,186
that there are some selection pressures
for our logic and our mathematics

370
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,392
to be at least in the direction of truth.

371
00:20:57,392 --> 00:21:00,039
I mean, if you're like me,
math and logic is not easy.

372
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,390
We don't get it all right, but at least
the selection pressures are not

373
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,728
uniformly away from true math and logic.

374
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:09,048
So I think that we'll find that we have
to look at each cognitive faculty

375
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,672
one at a time and see
what evolution does to it.

376
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:15,433
What's true about perception may not
be true about math and logic.

377
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:19,427
CA: I mean, really what you're proposing
is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley

378
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,818
interpretation of the world:

379
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,767
consciousness causes matter,
not the other way around.

380
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,159
DH: Well, it's slightly
different than Berkeley.

381
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,521
Berkeley thought that, he was a deist,
and he thought that the ultimate

382
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,560
nature of reality is God
and so forth,

383
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,670
and I don't need to go
where Berkeley's going,

384
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,365
so it's quite a bit
different from Berkeley.

385
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:43,055
I call this conscious realism.
It's actually a very different approach.

386
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:46,645
CA: Don, I could literally talk with you
for hours, and I hope to do that.

387
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:49,118
Thanks so much for that.
DH: Thank you. (Applause)
