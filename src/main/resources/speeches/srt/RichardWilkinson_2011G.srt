1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,820
has been around since before the French Revolution.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
What's changed

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
is we now can look at the evidence,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
and see what inequality does.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm going to take you through that data

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
and then explain why

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,820
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
(Laughter)

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
I want to start though

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
with a paradox.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
This shows you life expectancy

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
against gross national income --

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
how rich countries are on average.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
And you see the countries on the right,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
like Norway and the USA,

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,820
are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,820
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
But if we look within our societies,

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
there are extraordinary social gradients in health

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
running right across society.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
This, again, is life expectancy.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
These are small areas of England and Wales --

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,820
the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Even the people just below the top

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
have less good health

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
than the people at the top.

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
So income means something very important

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
within our societies,

35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
and nothing between them.

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
The explanation of that paradox

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
is that, within our societies,

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
we're looking at relative income

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
or social position, social status --

40
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
where we are in relation to each other

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
and the size of the gaps between us.

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
And as soon as you've got that idea,

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
you should immediately wonder:

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
what happens if we widen the differences,

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
or compress them,

46
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
make the income differences bigger or smaller?

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
And that's what I'm going to show you.

48
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I'm not using any hypothetical data.

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
I'm taking data from the U.N. --

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
it's the same as the World Bank has --

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
on the scale of income differences

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
in these rich developed market democracies.

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
The measure we've used,

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
because it's easy to understand and you can download it,

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
is how much richer the top 20 percent

56
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
than the bottom 20 percent in each country.

57
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
And you see in the more equal countries on the left --

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden --

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich

60
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
as the bottom 20 percent.

61
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
But on the more unequal end --

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore --

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
the differences are twice as big.

64
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
On that measure, we are twice as unequal

65
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
as some of the other successful market democracies.

66
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
We collected data on problems with social gradients,

68
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
the kind of problems that are more common

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
at the bottom of the social ladder.

70
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy,

71
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,820
on kids' maths and literacy scores,

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
on infant mortality rates, homicide rates,

73
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,

74
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
levels of trust,

75
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
obesity, mental illness --

76
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
which in standard diagnostic classification

77
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
includes drug and alcohol addiction --

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
and social mobility.

79
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
We put them all in one index.

80
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
They're all weighted equally.

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.

82
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
And there, you see it

83
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,

84
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
which I shall use over and over again in the data.

85
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
The more unequal countries

86
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
are doing worse

87
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
on all these kinds of social problems.

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.

89
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
But if you look at that same index

90
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
of health and social problems

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
in relation to GNP per capita,

92
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
gross national income,

93
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
there's nothing there,

94
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
no correlation anymore.

95
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
We were a little bit worried

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
that people might think

97
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument

98
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
and just manufactured this evidence,

99
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal

100
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,820
on the UNICEF index of child well-being.

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
It has 40 different components

102
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
put together by other people.

103
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,

104
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
whether they have books at home,

105
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Everything goes into it.

107
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.

108
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Highly significant relationship.

110
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
But once again,

111
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
if you look at that measure of child well-being,

112
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
in relation to national income per person,

113
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
there's no relationship,

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
no suggestion of a relationship.

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
What all the data I've shown you so far says

116
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
is the same thing.

117
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
The average well-being of our societies

118
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
is not dependent any longer

119
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
on national income and economic growth.

120
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
That's very important in poorer countries,

121
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
but not in the rich developed world.

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
But the differences between us

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
and where we are in relation to each other

124
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
now matter very much.

125
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.

126
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Here, for instance, is trust.

127
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
It's simply the proportion of the population

128
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
who agree most people can be trusted.

129
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
It comes from the World Values Survey.

130
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
You see, at the more unequal end,

131
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
it's about 15 percent of the population

132
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
who feel they can trust others.

133
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
But in the more equal societies,

134
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,820
it rises to 60 or 65 percent.

135
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life

136
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
or social capital,

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
very similar relationships

138
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
closely related to inequality.

139
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
I may say, we did all this work twice.

140
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
We did it first on these rich, developed countries,

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
and then as a separate test bed,

142
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
we repeated it all on the 50 American states --

143
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
asking just the same question:

144
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
do the more unequal states

145
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
do worse on all these kinds of measures?

146
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,820
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government

147
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
related to inequality.

148
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Very similar scatter

149
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
over a similar range of levels of trust.

150
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Same thing is going on.

151
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
Basically we found

152
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,820
that almost anything that's related to trust internationally

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
is related to trust amongst the 50 states

154
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
in that separate test bed.

155
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
We're not just talking about a fluke.

156
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
This is mental illness.

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
WHO put together figures

158
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
using the same diagnostic interviews

159
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
on random samples of the population

160
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
to allow us to compare rates of mental illness

161
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
in each society.

162
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
This is the percent of the population

163
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
with any mental illness in the preceding year.

164
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And it goes from about eight percent

165
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
up to three times that --

166
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
whole societies

167
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
with three times the level of mental illness of others.

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,820
And again, closely related to inequality.

169
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
This is violence.

170
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
These red dots are American states,

171
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,820
and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.

172
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
But look at the scale of the differences.

173
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
It goes from 15 homicides per million

174
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
up to 150.

175
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
This is the proportion of the population in prison.

176
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
There's a about a tenfold difference there,

177
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
log scale up the side.

178
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
But it goes from about 40 to 400

179
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
people in prison.

180
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
That relationship

181
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
is not mainly driven by more crime.

182
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
In some places, that's part of it.

183
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,

184
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
harsher sentencing.

185
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
And the more unequal societies

186
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,820
are more likely also to retain the death penalty.

187
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Here we have children dropping out of high school.

188
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Again, quite big differences.

189
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Extraordinarily damaging,

190
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
if you're talking about using the talents of the population.

191
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
This is social mobility.

192
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
It's actually a measure of mobility

193
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
based on income.

194
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Basically, it's asking:

195
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
do rich fathers have rich sons

196
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
and poor fathers have poor sons,

197
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
or is there no relationship between the two?

198
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
And at the more unequal end,

199
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
fathers' income is much more important --

200
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
in the U.K., USA.

201
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
And in Scandinavian countries,

202
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
fathers' income is much less important.

203
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
There's more social mobility.

204
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
And as we like to say --

205
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --

206
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
if Americans want to live the American dream,

207
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
they should go to Denmark.

208
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
(Laughter)

209
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
(Applause)

210
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.

211
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
I could have shown a number of other problems.

212
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
They're all problems that tend to be more common

213
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
at the bottom of the social gradient.

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
But there are endless problems with social gradients

215
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
that are worse in more unequal countries --

216
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
not just a little bit worse,

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.

218
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Think of the expense,

219
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
the human cost of that.

220
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier

221
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
where we put it all together

222
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
to make two points.

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
One is that, in graph after graph,

224
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
we find the countries that do worse,

225
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
whatever the outcome,

226
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
seem to be the more unequal ones,

227
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
and the ones that do well

228
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.

229
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
So what we're looking at

230
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
is general social disfunction related to inequality.

231
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
It's not just one or two things that go wrong,

232
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
it's most things.

233
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
The other really important point I want to make on this graph

234
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
is that, if you look at the bottom,

235
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Sweden and Japan,

236
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.

237
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
The position of women,

238
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
how closely they keep to the nuclear family,

239
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
are on opposite ends of the poles

240
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
in terms of the rich developed world.

241
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
But another really important difference

242
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
is how they get their greater equality.

243
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
Sweden has huge differences in earnings,

244
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
and it narrows the gap through taxation,

245
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
general welfare state,

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
generous benefits and so on.

247
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
Japan is rather different though.

248
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.

249
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
It has lower taxes.

250
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
It has a smaller welfare state.

251
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
And in our analysis of the American states,

252
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
we find rather the same contrast.

253
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,820
There are some states that do well through redistribution,

254
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
some states that do well

255
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
because they have smaller income differences before tax.

256
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
So we conclude

257
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,

258
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
as long as you get there somehow.

259
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I am not talking about perfect equality,

260
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.

261
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Another really surprising part of this picture

262
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
is that it's not just the poor

263
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
who are affected by inequality.

264
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's

265
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
"No man is an island."

266
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,820
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare

267
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,820
how people do in more and less equal countries

268
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
at each level in the social hierarchy.

269
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
This is just one example.

270
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
It's infant mortality.

271
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths

272
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,820
according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.

273
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
And so it's anachronistically

274
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
a classification by fathers' occupations,

275
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
so single parents go on their own.

276
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
But then where it says "low social class,"

277
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
that's unskilled manual occupations.

278
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,

279
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
then the junior non-manual,

280
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
going up high to the professional occupations --

281
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
doctors, lawyers,

282
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
directors of larger companies.

283
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain

284
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
all the way across the social hierarchy.

285
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.

286
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
But even at the top,

287
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
there seems to be a small benefit

288
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
to being in a more equal society.

289
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
We show that on about five different sets of data

290
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
covering educational outcomes

291
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
and health in the United States and internationally.

292
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And that seems to be the general picture --

293
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,

294
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,820
but has some benefits even at the top.

295
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,820
But I should say a few words about what's going on.

296
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I think I'm looking and talking

297
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
about the psychosocial effects of inequality.

298
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,

299
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
of being valued and devalued,

300
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
respected and disrespected.

301
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
And of course, those feelings

302
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
of the status competition that comes out of that

303
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
drives the consumerism in our society.

304
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
It also leads to status insecurity.

305
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,820
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,

306
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
whether we're regarded as attractive, clever,

307
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
all that kind of thing.

308
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
The social-evaluative judgments increase,

309
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,820
the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.

310
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Interestingly,

311
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,820
some parallel work going on in social psychology:

312
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
some people reviewed 208 different studies

313
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
in which volunteers had been invited

314
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
into a psychological laboratory

315
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
and had their stress hormones,

316
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,820
their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.

317
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
And in the review,

318
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
what they were interested in seeing

319
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
is what kind of stresses

320
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
most reliably raise levels of cortisol,

321
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
the central stress hormone.

322
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
And the conclusion was

323
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat --

324
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
threats to self-esteem or social status

325
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
in which others can negatively judge your performance.

326
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Those kind of stresses

327
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
have a very particular effect

328
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
on the physiology of stress.

329
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Now we have been criticized.

330
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff

331
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and people who find it very surprising.

332
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
I should tell you though

333
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,

334
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
we never pick and choose data.

335
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
We have an absolute rule

336
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,

337
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
it goes into the analysis.

338
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
Our data source decides

339
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
whether it's reliable data,

340
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
we don't.

341
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Otherwise that would introduce bias.

342
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
What about other countries?

343
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,820
There are 200 studies

344
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
of health in relation to income and equality

345
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
in the academic peer-reviewed journals.

346
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
This isn't confined to these countries here,

347
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
hiding a very simple demonstration.

348
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
The same countries,

349
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
the same measure of inequality,

350
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
one problem after another.

351
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Why don't we control for other factors?

352
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita

353
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
doesn't make any difference.

354
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,820
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature

355
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
have controlled for poverty and education

356
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
and so on.

357
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
What about causality?

358
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.

359
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
We spend a good bit of time.

360
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well

361
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
in some of these outcomes.

362
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
The big change in our understanding

363
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
of drivers of chronic health

364
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
in the rich developed world

365
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,820
is how important chronic stress from social sources

366
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
is affecting the immune system,

367
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
the cardiovascular system.

368
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Or for instance, the reason why violence

369
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
becomes more common in more unequal societies

370
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,820
is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.

371
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I should say that to deal with this,

372
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
we've got to deal with the post-tax things

373
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
and the pre-tax things.

374
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
We've got to constrain income,

375
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
the bonus culture incomes at the top.

376
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees

377
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
in any way we can.

378
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
I think the take-home message though

379
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
is that we can improve the real quality of human life

380
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
by reducing the differences in incomes between us.

381
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Suddenly we have a handle

382
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,

383
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
and that's exciting.

384
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Thank you.

385
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,820
(Applause)
