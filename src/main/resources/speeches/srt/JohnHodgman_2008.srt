1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
You all know this story.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
In the summer of 1950,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
and atomic-pile builder,

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
"Where is everybody?"

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
This confused his colleagues, obviously,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
because they were sitting right there with him.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
He was talking about the space aliens.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
You see, this was only a few years after

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
the supposed flying saucer crash

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
at Roswell, New Mexico.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
And even though that turned out to be nothing,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
nothing at all --

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,820
(Laughter) --

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
merely a downed weather balloon

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,820
piloted by small hairless men

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
with slits for mouths ...

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Still, America had gone saucer-mad,

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
even famous scientists

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
who were eating lunch.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
is that the universe is so vast

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
that it stands to reason,

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
there should be other intelligent life out there.

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
And the universe is so old

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,820
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
we should have some evidence of their existence by now.

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,820
"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
and his colleagues had no answer.

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
to disprove fairies,

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Sasquatch, God,

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
the possibility of love --

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
and thereafter, as you know,

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Enrico Fermi ate alone.

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
(Laughter)

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,820
Now,

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,820
I am not a scientist.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I have never built an atomic pile.

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Although, I might argue that, technically,

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
every pile is atomic.

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
(Laughter)

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,820
However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
One is that the aliens might be

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
very far away.

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Perhaps, I dare say,

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
even on other planets.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
The other possibility --

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
(Laughter) --

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
was an alien.

57
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
(Laughter)

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Think about it.

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Isn't it a little convenient

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
suddenly an Italian scientist showed up

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
with an amazing new technology

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
that would transform everything in the world

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and darken the history of the human species forever after?

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
And isn't it a little strange

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
that he required no payment for this?

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
That he asked for only one thing --

68
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
a gift of two healthy sperm whales?

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
That's -- that's not true.

70
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
But it is strange.

71
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,820
(Laughter)

72
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,820
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
his fellow scientists

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,820
that the space aliens are not already here?

76
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
For it is given in certain UFO-ology

77
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,820
or UFOlogy circles,

78
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
that they have walked among us in disguise,

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
observing us, guiding our evolution

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
from ape to man --

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
if you believe in that sort of thing --

83
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,820
and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers

84
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
(Laughter)

86
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
It's a difficult theory to discount,

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
I think you'll agree.

88
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
(Laughter)

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
For even in my own life,

90
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
there are memories I have

91
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
that are difficult to explain --

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,

93
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
that it is difficult to imagine

94
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
they were not the result

95
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,820
of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
For how else will you explain

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
the amazing and absolutely true

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
close encounters that I had

99
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
and will describe to you now?

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.

101
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
This was the summer when the special edition of

102
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,820
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,

105
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
(Laughter)

107
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
And so I spent the rest of the vacation

108
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,

109
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
the sidewalk still warm from the sun,

110
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
watching the skies for UFOs.

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
What did I see? Stars, satellites,

112
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.

113
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Occasionally, kids would come and

114
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
join me and watch,

115
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk

116
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
to play video games and mingle with humans.

117
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,

118
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
so I stayed alone with the cosmos.

119
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
And that's when it happened.

120
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
An elderly couple came walking down the street.

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I would say they were in their late seventies,

122
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
and I would say that they were on a date,

123
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
because he was wearing a very neat little suit

124
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
and a chill was coming in off the ocean.

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
I remember, for some reason,

128
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
that they were exactly the same height.

129
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
And then they stopped, and the man turned to me

130
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
and said,

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
"What are you looking for,

132
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
flying saucers?"

133
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,820
(Laughter)

134
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work

135
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
for an old man on a date.

136
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
But what was stranger still --

137
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and even I realized it at the time,

138
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
as a nine-year-old child --

139
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
was that they stopped at all.

140
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll

141
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
with his sweetheart with the precise reason

142
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
of making fun of a child.

143
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
"Oh," he said,

144
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
"little green men."

145
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
And then his girlfriend joined in, too.

146
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
"There's no such thing as space men," she said.

147
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
"There's no such thing."

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."

149
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
I looked around.

150
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
The street was entirely empty.

151
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.

152
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
It was as though time had stopped.

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
I did not know why they were teasing me.

154
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,820
I looked into their strangely angry faces,

155
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and I remember wondering,

156
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
are they wearing rubber masks?

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
(Laughter)

158
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,820
And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?

159
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?

160
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Slits for mouths?

161
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,

162
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
and then he made laser sounds.

163
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
"Kew, kew, kew --

164
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
watch out."

165
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
And they turned at once and walked away.

166
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
The old man reached out

167
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
his knobbly claw

168
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
for the woman's hand,

169
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
and found it, and left me alone.

170
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --

171
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
a strange encounter among humans.

172
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Maybe it was swamp gas, but --

173
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
(Laughter) --

174
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
I know what I saw.

175
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.

176
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
I went to see the movie "Dune,"

177
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --

178
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
(Laughter) --

179
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
this is impossible on its face, I realize --

180
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
but it is absolutely true.

181
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
It was opening night, naturally.

182
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.

183
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
On my right was the girl in question.

184
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.

185
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.

187
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
She was very tall, I would say.

188
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,

189
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.

190
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
I didn't know her name, and I never will.

191
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,

192
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."

193
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
They were both big fans, mother and daughter --

194
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
very unusual.

195
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
They were talking about how their favorite characters

196
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
were the giant sandworms.

197
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
And then it got stranger.

198
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
That's when she turned to me and said,

199
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"

200
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
(Laughter)

201
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
First of all, I was embarrassed

202
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.

203
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I was merely a connoisseur of movies

204
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
featuring desert planets, as I still am.

205
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
(Laughter)

206
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:

207
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,

208
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
as though she just wanted to talk to me.

209
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."

210
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
I did not even turn my head.

211
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
The movie began.

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"

213
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
in which all of the characters

214
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
were sexy and deformed at the same time.

215
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
(Laughter)

216
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,

217
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,820
which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist

219
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
of psychedelic spice

220
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
swirling around him,

221
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
allowing him to bend space and time.

222
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
He could never leave the tank

223
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
or interact with the outside world.

224
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
He had become, in his isolation,

225
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
so deformed and so sexy,

226
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio

227
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
to the outside world, and could never touch them.

228
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.

229
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?

230
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Please.

231
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
When the movie ended,

232
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
everyone seemed very happy

233
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Except for the girl.

235
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
As I walked out, her pace slowed.

236
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Perhaps it was the crutches,

237
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
but it seemed --

238
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
(Laughter) --

239
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,820
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.

240
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,

241
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
but I can only come to the conclusion

242
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
that it was what, in the alien abductee community,

243
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
they call a "screen memory":

244
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain

245
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped

246
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
and flown off to a sex pyramid.

247
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
(Laughter)

248
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
And so I sure am glad

249
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
I did not slow down to talk to her.

250
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,820
I sure am glad I never saw her again.

251
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

252
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
1989.

253
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
In the mid-to-late '80s,

254
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"

255
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
in which he described his own lifelong experiences

256
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
being abducted by aliens.

257
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community

258
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
as "lost time,"

259
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware

260
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,

261
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.

262
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens

263
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
were taking him and giving him rectal probes.

264
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
(Laughter)

265
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.

266
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,

267
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
and was his, sort of, police sketch

268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
of what the creatures looked like

269
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
that Whitley Strieber had described to him.

270
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,820
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.

271
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
And in 1989, the way I remember it,

272
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I was in Philadelphia

273
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,

274
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.

275
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.

276
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
One: Whitley Strieber

277
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
was played by Christopher Walken.

278
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.

279
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
(Laughter)

280
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Three: there was a surprisingly long

281
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet

282
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.

283
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Four: this was being shown

284
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.

285
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Five: all of which is to say,

286
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"

287
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
and it starred Christopher Walken.

288
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Does something seem strange about this to you?

289
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?

290
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Think about it. Yes. The answer is:

291
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
I had a girlfriend. What?

292
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
(Laughter)

293
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
How did this happen? When did this happen?

294
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
I remember walking out of the theater

295
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,

296
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
as we walked hand in hand,

297
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
and pondering these very same questions.

298
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
And to this day, I have no answer for you.

299
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Close encounter four: the Algarve,

300
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Portugal, 1991.

301
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Some years later, I and this woman --

302
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --

303
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
(Laughter) --

304
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
went traveling through the south of Portugal together.

305
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,820
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,

306
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
in tiny little hotels,

307
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde

308
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
and watch the sun set and play checkers.

309
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,820
What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?

310
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
We went to some topless beaches.

311
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Excuse me? No, not in my life.

312
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,

313
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.

314
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,

315
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,820
and the lead dog bit me on the ass,

316
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic

317
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
and receive an ass shot.

318
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Make of that what you will.

319
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
(Laughter)

320
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Our last day in Portugal,

321
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
we were in the district capital of Faro,

322
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach

323
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
one last time.

324
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Now, Faro is a bustling little city,

325
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take

326
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
a bus and then a boat.

327
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
And did I want to come with?

328
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."

329
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I remember what she looked like before she left.

330
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
The freckles had grown

331
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and multiplied on her face and shoulders,

332
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
clustering into a kind of a tan.

333
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
A tan, we were both tan --

334
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
is this true?

335
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.

336
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
She was smiling.

337
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,

338
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
not even speaking the language,

339
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
to travel alone by bus and boat

340
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
to go to a beach she did not know

341
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
or had never seen.

342
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I loved her, and then she went out

343
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
into that strange, alien land.

344
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,820
It took me some time to come to my senses.

345
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
I had my own "lost time" moment,

346
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
where I woke up and suddenly realized

347
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,

348
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
and she had not come back.

349
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.

350
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Now, I did not speak Portuguese.

351
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
I did not know where the beach was.

352
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,

353
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

354
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,820
(Laughter)

355
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
I realized that the day would only have

356
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
two possible outcomes:

357
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
either Catherine would come back to the hotel,

358
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
or she would never come back to the hotel.

359
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
And so I sat down to wait.

360
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,820
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street

361
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
where the buses and cars and pedestrians

362
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
and little scooters were moving along.

363
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
And I watched those constellations shift,

364
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
hoping that they would part and I would see her face.

365
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
It was at that moment,

366
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
in that very small town of 30,000 or so,

367
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,820
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe

368
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
and the searching we might do in it.

369
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
And that's when the Liberians came along.

370
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,

371
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

372
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me

373
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
what was I doing, and I explained.

374
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.

375
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
But he did not seem so very sure,

376
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
for he sat down to wait with me.

377
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:

378
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,

379
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
telling me jokes, distracting me.

380
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Two hours, they gave me a message.

381
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
We are not alone.

382
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,

383
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
I turned and looked down the street.

384
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
The stars aligned, and she came back.

385
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.

386
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Neither did the Liberians,

387
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter

388
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room

389
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
and left us alone in the street, holding hands.

390
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,820
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,

391
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
much like a piece of alien technology

392
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
that has been inserted into your buttocks

393
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
by a "Portuguese doctor."

394
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
(Laughter)

395
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And even now, a decade and a half later,

396
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
even now that we are married,

397
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.

398
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,820
And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable

399
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
that during the time she was away,

400
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,

401
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I love her and wait for her still.

402
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Thank you for your kind attention.

403
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
(Applause)
