1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,796
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,796
two million years seems
like a really long time.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,796
But evolutionarily,
two million years is nothing.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,652
And yet in two million years,

5
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:25,796
the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,392
going from the one-and-a-quarter pound
brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,630
to the almost three-pound meatloaf

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,796
that everybody here
has between their ears.

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,629
What is it about a big brain

10
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:42,254
that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one?

11
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:44,796
Well, it turns out when
brains triple in size,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,132
they don't just get three times bigger;
they gain new structures.

13
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:52,796
And one of the main reasons our brain got
so big is because it got a new part,

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,250
called the "frontal lobe."

15
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,902
Particularly, a part called
the "pre-frontal cortex."

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,796
What does a pre-frontal cortex
do for you that should justify

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,526
the entire architectural overhaul
of the human skull

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,951
in the blink of evolutionary time?

19
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:09,657
It turns out the pre-frontal
cortex does lots of things,

20
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:15,343
but one of the most important things
it does is an experience simulator.

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,796
Pilots practice in flight simulators

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,375
so that they don't make
real mistakes in planes.

23
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,705
Human beings have this
marvelous adaptation

24
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,796
that they can actually have
experiences in their heads

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,442
before they try them out in real life.

26
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,099
This is a trick that none
of our ancestors could do,

27
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,362
and that no other animal
can do quite like we can.

28
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:38,320
It's a marvelous adaptation.

29
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:41,796
It's up there with opposable thumbs
and standing upright and language

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,796
as one of the things that got
our species out of the trees

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,796
and into the shopping mall.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,184
(Laughter)

33
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,796
All of you have done this.

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,796
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have
liver-and-onion ice cream,

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,106
and it's not because they whipped
some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,796
It's because, without
leaving your armchair,

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,227
you can simulate that flavor
and say "yuck" before you make it.

38
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:10,587
Let's see how your experience
simulators are working.

39
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,231
Let's just run a quick diagnostic

40
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,288
before I proceed
with the rest of the talk.

41
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,796
Here's two different futures
that I invite you to contemplate.

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,796
You can try to simulate them and tell me
which one you think you might prefer.

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,527
One of them is winning the lottery.
This is about 314 million dollars.

44
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:30,281
And the other is becoming paraplegic.

45
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:31,321
(Laughter)

46
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,229
Just give it a moment of thought.

47
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,062
You probably don't feel
like you need a moment of thought.

48
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:39,796
Interestingly, there are data
on these two groups of people,

49
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,796
data on how happy they are.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,514
And this is exactly what you
expected, isn't it?

51
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,796
But these aren't the data.
I made these up!

52
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,010
These are the data.

53
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,796
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly
five minutes into the lecture.

54
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,796
Because the fact is that a year
after losing the use of their legs,

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,796
and a year after winning the lotto,
lottery winners and paraplegics

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,237
are equally happy with their lives.

57
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,313
Don't feel too bad
about failing the first pop quiz,

58
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,964
because everybody fails
all of the pop quizzes all of the time.

59
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,375
The research that my laboratory
has been doing,

60
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,730
that economists and psychologists
around the country have been doing,

61
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:19,929
has revealed something
really quite startling to us,

62
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,796
something we call the "impact bias,"

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,274
which is the tendency
for the simulator to work badly.

64
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:28,796
For the simulator to make you
believe that different outcomes

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,796
are more different
than in fact they really are.

66
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,796
From field studies to laboratory studies,

67
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,862
we see that winning or losing an election,
gaining or losing a romantic partner,

68
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,796
getting or not getting a promotion,
passing or not passing a college test,

69
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,716
on and on, have far less impact,
less intensity and much less duration

70
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,479
than people expect them to have.

71
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:55,114
This almost floors me --

72
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:58,796
a recent study showing
how major life traumas affect people

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,796
suggests that if it happened
over three months ago,

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,382
with only a few exceptions,

75
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:06,164
it has no impact whatsoever
on your happiness.

76
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,025
Why?

77
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:13,346
Because happiness can be synthesized.

78
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,656
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,
"I am the happiest man alive.

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,796
I have that in me that can convert poverty
to riches, adversity to prosperity.

80
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,766
I am more invulnerable than Achilles;
fortune hath not one place to hit me."

81
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,979
What kind of remarkable machinery
does this guy have in his head?

82
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:35,948
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same
remarkable machinery that all off us have.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,864
Human beings have something

84
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:42,129
that we might think of
as a "psychological immune system."

85
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:47,146
A system of cognitive processes, largely
non-conscious cognitive processes,

86
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,604
that help them change
their views of the world,

87
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,025
so that they can feel better

88
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,977
about the worlds
in which they find themselves.

89
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,867
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.

90
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,796
Unlike Sir Thomas,
you seem not to know it.

91
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:06,796
We synthesize happiness, but we think
happiness is a thing to be found.

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,494
Now, you don't need me to give you

93
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:12,606
too many examples of people
synthesizing happiness, I suspect.

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,254
Though I'm going to show
you some experimental evidence,

95
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:17,398
you don't have to look
very far for evidence.

96
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:21,046
As a challenge to myself, since I say
this once in a while in lectures,

97
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,741
I took a copy of the New York Times

98
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,949
and tried to find some instances
of people synthesizing happiness.

99
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,986
Here are three guys
synthesizing happiness.

100
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,403
"I am so much better off physically,
financially, emotionally, mentally

101
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,188
and almost every other way."

102
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:36,260
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience."

103
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,216
"I believe it turned out for the best."

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,489
Who are these characters
who are so damn happy?

105
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:41,883
The first one is Jim Wright.

106
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,778
Some of you are old enough to remember:

107
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,265
he was the chairman
of the House of Representatives

108
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,661
and he resigned in disgrace

109
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,840
when this young Republican
named Newt Gingrich

110
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:52,008
found out about a shady
book deal he had done.

111
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,066
He lost everything.

112
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,832
The most powerful Democrat
in the country lost everything.

113
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,796
He lost his money, he lost his power.

114
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,208
What does he have to say
all these years later?

115
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,971
"I am so much better off physically,
financially, mentally

116
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,796
and in almost every other way."

117
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,059
What other way would there
be to be better off?

118
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,911
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?

119
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,649
He's pretty much covered them there.

120
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,154
Moreese Bickham is somebody
you've never heard of.

121
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,858
Moreese Bickham uttered these
words upon being released.

122
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,191
He was 78 years old.

123
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:21,138
He'd spent 37 years
in a Louisiana State Penitentiary

124
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,646
for a crime he didn't commit.

125
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,503
[He was ultimately released

126
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:26,796
for good behavior
halfway through his sentence.]

127
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,796
What did he say about his experience?

128
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,378
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience." Glorious!

129
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,473
He is not saying,

130
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,859
"Well, there were some nice guys.
They had a gym."

131
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:36,910
"Glorious,"

132
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:40,140
a word we usually reserve for something
like a religious experience.

133
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:44,502
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words,
and he's somebody you might have known

134
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:48,235
but didn't, because in 1949 he read
a little article in the paper

135
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,225
about a hamburger stand owned
by two brothers named McDonalds.

136
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:53,480
And he thought,
"That's a really neat idea!"

137
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,187
So he went to find them. They said,

138
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,755
"We can give you a franchise
on this for 3,000 bucks."

139
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,019
Harry went back to New York, asked
his brother, an investment banker,

140
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,951
to loan him the $3,000,
and his brother's immortal words were,

141
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:05,693
"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

142
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,206
He wouldn't lend him the money,

143
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,444
and of course, six months later
Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

144
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:12,662
It turns out people do eat hamburgers,

145
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,820
and Ray Kroc, for a while,
became the richest man in America.

146
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,510
And then finally -- you know,
the best of all possible worlds --

147
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:23,796
some of you recognize
this young photo of Pete Best,

148
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,963
who was the original
drummer for the Beatles,

149
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,963
until they, you know, sent him
out on an errand and snuck away

150
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,796
and picked up Ringo on a tour.

151
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,916
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best
was interviewed

152
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,796
-- yes, he's still a drummer;
yes, he's a studio musician --

153
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,396
he had this to say: "I'm happier
than I would have been with the Beatles."

154
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,563
Okay. There's something important
to be learned from these people,

155
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,296
and it is the secret of happiness.

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,996
Here it is, finally to be revealed.

157
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,773
First: accrue wealth, power,
and prestige, then lose it.

158
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,796
(Laughter)

159
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,517
Second: spend as much of your life
in prison as you possibly can.

160
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,542
(Laughter)

161
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,796
Third: make somebody else
really, really rich.

162
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,543
And finally: never ever join the Beatles.

163
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,796
(Laughter)

164
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,796
OK. Now I, like Ze Frank,
can predict your next thought,

165
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,963
which is, "Yeah, right."

166
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:13,315
Because when people synthesize happiness,

167
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,433
as these gentlemen seem to have done,

168
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:20,236
we all smile at them,
but we kind of roll our eyes and say,

169
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,796
"Yeah right, you never
really wanted the job."

170
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,796
"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have
that much in common with her,

171
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,916
and you figured that out just
about the time

172
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,036
she threw the engagement
ring in your face."

173
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,796
We smirk because we believe
that synthetic happiness

174
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,106
is not of the same quality
as what we might call "natural happiness."

175
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,772
What are these terms?

176
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:43,200
Natural happiness is what we get
when we get what we wanted,

177
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:47,796
and synthetic happiness is what we make
when we don't get what we wanted.

178
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,796
And in our society,
we have a strong belief

179
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,796
that synthetic happiness
is of an inferior kind.

180
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,557
Why do we have that belief?

181
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:57,978
Well, it's very simple.

182
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,795
What kind of economic engine
would keep churning

183
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,755
if we believed
that not getting what we want

184
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,295
could make us just as happy as getting it?

185
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,351
With all apologies
to my friend Matthieu Ricard,

186
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,577
a shopping mall full of Zen monks

187
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:15,715
is not going to be
particularly profitable,

188
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:18,341
because they don't want stuff enough.

189
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,446
(Laughter)

190
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,567
I want to suggest to you
that synthetic happiness

191
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,796
is every bit as real and enduring

192
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,471
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon

193
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:30,058
when you get exactly
what you were aiming for.

194
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:32,858
I'm a scientist, so I'm going
to do this not with rhetoric,

195
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:35,033
but by marinating you
in a little bit of data.

196
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:38,003
Let me first show you an experimental
paradigm that is used

197
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:42,209
to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness
among regular old folks.

198
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,250
And this isn't mine.

199
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:46,391
It's a 50-year-old paradigm
called the "free choice paradigm."

200
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,796
It's very simple.

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,526
You bring in, say, six objects,

202
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,811
and you ask a subject to rank them
from the most to the least liked.

203
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:56,393
In this case, because
this experiment uses them,

204
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,796
these are Monet prints.

205
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,796
So, everybody can rank these Monet prints

206
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
from the one they like the most,
to the one they like the least.

207
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,535
Now we give you a choice:

208
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,961
"We happen to have
some extra prints in the closet.

209
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,606
We're going to give you
one as your prize to take home.

210
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,462
We happen to have number three
and number four," we tell the subject.

211
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:15,384
This is a bit of a difficult choice,

212
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:18,010
because neither one is preferred
strongly to the other,

213
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,654
but naturally, people
tend to pick number three

214
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:23,256
because they liked it
a little better than number four.

215
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:27,688
Sometime later -- it could be
15 minutes; it could be 15 days --

216
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,796
the same stimuli are put
before the subject,

217
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,525
and the subject is asked
to re-rank the stimuli.

218
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,526
"Tell us how much you like them now."

219
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,757
What happens?

220
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,750
Watch as happiness is synthesized.

221
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:40,796
This is the result that has
been replicated over and over again.

222
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,811
You're watching happiness be synthesized.

223
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,327
Would you like to see it again?

224
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:46,796
Happiness!

225
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,059
"The one I got is really
better than I thought!

226
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,796
That other one I didn't get sucks!"

227
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,963
That's the synthesis of happiness.

228
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,024
(Laughter)

229
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,097
Now, what's the right response to that?

230
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,795
"Yeah, right!"

231
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,796
Now, here's the experiment we did,

232
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,735
and I hope this is going to convince you

233
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,036
that "Yeah, right!"
was not the right response.

234
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,282
We did this experiment
with a group of patients

235
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,703
who had anterograde amnesia.

236
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,386
These are hospitalized patients.

237
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,575
Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,

238
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,599
a polyneuritic psychosis.

239
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,796
They drank way too much,
and they can't make new memories.

240
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,733
OK? They remember their childhood,
but if you walk in and introduce yourself,

241
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:24,950
and then leave the room,

242
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,228
when you come back,
they don't know who you are.

243
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,081
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.

244
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:34,796
And we asked these patients to rank them

245
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,916
from the one they liked
the most to the one they liked the least.

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,796
We then gave them the choice
between number three and number four.

247
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,796
Like everybody else, they said,

248
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,487
"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great!
I could use a new print.

249
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:47,796
I'll take number three."

250
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,796
We explained we would have
number three mailed to them.

251
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,796
We gathered up our materials
and we went out of the room,

252
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,183
and counted to a half hour.

253
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,208
(Laughter)

254
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,716
Back into the room,
we say, "Hi, we're back."

255
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,796
The patients, bless them,
say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,

256
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,557
I've got a memory problem;
that's why I'm here.

257
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,581
If I've met you before, I don't remember."

258
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,796
"Really, you don't remember?
I was just here with the Monet prints?"

259
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,416
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."

260
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,812
"No problem, Jim. All I want
you to do is rank these for me

261
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:22,296
from the one you like the most
to the one you like the least."

262
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,353
What do they do?

263
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,282
Well, let's first check and make sure
they're really amnesiac.

264
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:29,796
We ask these amnesiac patients
to tell us which one they own,

265
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,619
which one they chose last
time, which one is theirs.

266
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,796
And what we find is amnesiac
patients just guess.

267
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,456
These are normal controls,
where if I did this with you,

268
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,583
all of you would know
which print you chose.

269
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:45,411
But if I do this with amnesiac patients,
they don't have a clue.

270
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:47,887
They can't pick
their print out of a lineup.

271
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,796
Here's what normal controls do:
they synthesize happiness.

272
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,000
Right? This is the change in liking score,

273
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,509
the change from the first time they ranked
to the second time they ranked.

274
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:01,613
Normal controls show --
that was the magic I showed you;

275
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:03,796
now I'm showing it to you
in graphical form --

276
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,957
"The one I own is better than I thought.

277
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,346
The one I didn't own,
the one I left behind,

278
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,067
is not as good as I thought."

279
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,796
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.
Think about this result.

280
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,241
These people like better the one they own,

281
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,820
but they don't know they own it.

282
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,376
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!

283
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,796
What these people did when
they synthesized happiness

284
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,797
is they really, truly changed

285
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:36,621
their affective, hedonic, aesthetic
reactions to that poster.

286
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,796
They're not just saying
it because they own it,

287
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,185
because they don't know they own it.

288
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,796
Now, when psychologists show you bars,

289
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,712
you know that they are showing
you averages of lots of people.

290
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,796
And yet, all of us have this
psychological immune system,

291
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,543
this capacity to synthesize happiness,

292
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,718
but some of us do this trick
better than others.

293
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:03,775
And some situations allow anybody
to do it more effectively

294
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,559
than other situations do.

295
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,384
It turns out that freedom

296
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,936
-- the ability to make up your mind
and change your mind --

297
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,313
is the friend of natural happiness,
because it allows you to choose

298
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:19,513
among all those delicious futures

299
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,796
and find the one
that you would most enjoy.

300
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,796
But freedom to choose,

301
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,916
to change and make up your mind,

302
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,523
is the enemy of synthetic happiness.

303
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:31,569
And I'm going to show you why.
Dilbert already knows, of course.

304
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:33,252
You're reading as I'm talking.

305
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:35,458
"Dogbert's tech support.
How may I abuse you?"

306
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:38,096
"My printer prints a blank
page after every document."

307
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,096
"Why complain about getting free paper?"

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,396
"Free? Aren't you just
giving me my own paper?"

309
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,096
"Look at the quality of the free paper
compared to your lousy regular paper!

310
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,896
Only a fool or a liar would say
that they look the same!"

311
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,682
"Now that you mention it,
it does seem a little silkier!"

312
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:52,882
"What are you doing?"

313
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:56,292
"I'm helping people accept the things
they cannot change." Indeed.

314
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,578
The psychological immune system works best

315
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:02,797
when we are totally stuck,
when we are trapped.

316
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,202
This is the difference
between dating and marriage.

317
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,796
You go out on a date with a guy,

318
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,456
and he picks his nose;
you don't go out on another date.

319
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,654
You're married to a guy
and he picks his nose?

320
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,160
He has a heart of gold.
Don't touch the fruitcake!

321
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:17,897
You find a way to be happy
with what's happened.

322
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,922
(Laughter)

323
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:20,796
Now, what I want to show you

324
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,796
is that people don't know
this about themselves,

325
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,264
and not knowing this can work
to our supreme disadvantage.

326
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,265
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.

327
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,154
We created a black-and-white
photography course,

328
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:35,796
and we allowed students to come in
and learn how to use a darkroom.

329
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,154
So we gave them cameras;
they went around campus;

330
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,535
they took 12 pictures
of their favorite professors

331
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,749
and their dorm room and their dog,

332
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,891
and all the other things they wanted
to have Harvard memories of.

333
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,441
They bring us the camera;
we make up a contact sheet;

334
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,760
they figure out which are
the two best pictures;

335
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,466
and we now spend six hours
teaching them about darkrooms.

336
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,931
And they blow two of them up,

337
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,201
and they have two gorgeous
eight-by-10 glossies

338
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,209
of meaningful things to them, and we say,

339
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,073
"Which one would you like to give up?"

340
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,785
They say, "I have to give one up?"

341
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,384
"Yes, we need one as evidence
of the class project.

342
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:08,026
So you have to give me one.
You have to make a choice.

343
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,796
You get to keep one,
and I get to keep one."

344
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,796
Now, there are two conditions
in this experiment.

345
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,098
In one case, the students are told,

346
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,478
"But you know,
if you want to change your mind,

347
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,355
I'll always have the other one here,

348
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,742
and in the next four days, before
I actually mail it to headquarters,"

349
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,796
-- yeah, "headquarters" --

350
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,796
"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

351
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,790
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room,
just give me an email.

352
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,805
Better yet, I'll check with you.

353
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,717
You ever want to change your mind,
it's totally returnable."

354
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:40,638
The other half of the students
are told exactly the opposite:

355
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:42,289
"Make your choice, and by the way,

356
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:45,306
the mail is going out, gosh,
in two minutes, to England.

357
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,052
Your picture will be winging
its way over the Atlantic.

358
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:49,979
You will never see it again."

359
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,520
Half of the students
in each of these conditions

360
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,956
are asked to make predictions

361
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,591
about how much they're going to come
to like the picture that they keep

362
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,296
and the picture they leave behind.

363
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,227
Other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms

364
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:06,796
and they are measured
over the next three to six days

365
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,095
on their liking, satisfaction
with the pictures.

366
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,311
And look at what we find.

367
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:13,645
First of all, here's what students
think is going to happen.

368
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:17,283
They think they're going to maybe
come to like the picture they chose

369
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,796
a little more
than the one they left behind,

370
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,335
but these are not statistically
significant differences.

371
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,009
It's a very small increase,
and it doesn't much matter

372
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:29,473
whether they were in the reversible
or irreversible condition.

373
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:33,796
Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because
here's what's really happening.

374
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,796
Both right before the swap
and five days later,

375
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,427
people who are stuck with that picture,

376
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,603
who have no choice,

377
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,794
who can never change their mind,

378
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,150
like it a lot!

379
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,796
And people who are deliberating
-- "Should I return it?

380
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,629
Have I gotten the right one?
Maybe this isn't the good one?

381
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,251
Maybe I left the good one?"
-- have killed themselves.

382
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:54,712
They don't like their picture,

383
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,568
and in fact even after the opportunity
to swap has expired,

384
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,401
they still don't like their picture.

385
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,260
Why?

386
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:04,796
Because the [reversible] condition
is not conducive

387
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,401
to the synthesis of happiness.

388
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:09,796
So here's the final piece
of this experiment.

389
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,796
We bring in a whole new group
of naive Harvard students

390
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,796
and we say, "You know,
we're doing a photography course,

391
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,669
and we can do it one of two ways.

392
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:22,049
We could do it so that when
you take the two pictures,

393
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,072
you'd have four days to change your mind,

394
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,969
or we're doing another course
where you take the two pictures

395
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:30,076
and you make up your mind right away
and you can never change it.

396
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,146
Which course would you like
to be in?" Duh!

397
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,796
66 percent of the students, two-thirds,

398
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,796
prefer to be in the course where they have
the opportunity to change their mind.

399
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,796
Hello? 66 percent of the students
choose to be in the course

400
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,796
in which they will ultimately be deeply
dissatisfied with the picture.

401
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,796
Because they do not know the conditions
under which synthetic happiness grows.

402
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,748
The Bard said everything best,
of course, and he's making my point here

403
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,796
but he's making it hyperbolically:

404
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,796
"'Tis nothing good or bad /
But thinking makes it so."

405
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,259
It's nice poetry,
but that can't exactly be right.

406
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:09,796
Is there really nothing good or bad?

407
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,011
Is it really the case that gall bladder
surgery and a trip to Paris

408
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,803
are just the same thing?

409
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:19,796
That seems like a one-question IQ test.

410
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,796
They can't be exactly the same.

411
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,796
In more turgid prose,
but closer to the truth,

412
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,963
was the father of modern capitalism,
Adam Smith, and he said this.

413
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,318
This is worth contemplating:

414
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:34,237
"The great source of both the misery
and disorders of human life

415
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,796
seems to arise from overrating
the difference

416
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,796
between one permanent
situation and another --

417
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,796
Some of these situations may, no doubt,
deserve to be preferred to others,

418
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,796
but none of them can deserve to be pursued

419
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,796
with that passionate ardor
which drives us to violate the rules

420
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,562
either of prudence or of justice,

421
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:00,669
or to corrupt the future
tranquility of our minds,

422
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:03,796
either by shame from the remembrance
of our own folly,

423
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,261
or by remorse for the horror
of our own injustice."

424
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:12,796
In other words: yes, some things
are better than others.

425
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,323
We should have preferences that lead us
into one future over another.

426
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:22,343
But when those preferences
drive us too hard and too fast

427
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,796
because we have overrated
the difference between these futures,

428
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,796
we are at risk.

429
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,646
When our ambition is bounded,
it leads us to work joyfully.

430
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,178
When our ambition is unbounded,

431
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:38,662
it leads us to lie, to cheat,
to steal, to hurt others,

432
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,850
to sacrifice things of real value.

433
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,673
When our fears are bounded,

434
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,831
we're prudent, we're cautious,

435
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,065
we're thoughtful.

436
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:49,323
When our fears
are unbounded and overblown,

437
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,796
we're reckless, and we're cowardly.

438
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,450
The lesson I want to leave you
with, from these data,

439
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:59,796
is that our longings and our worries
are both to some degree overblown,

440
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,796
because we have within us the capacity
to manufacture the very commodity

441
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,065
we are constantly chasing
when we choose experience.

442
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,089
Thank you.
