1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
A tourist is backpacking

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
through the highlands of Scotland,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
and he stops at a pub to get a drink.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
And the only people in there is a bartender

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
and an old man nursing a beer.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,820
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
"You see this bar?

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I built this bar with my bare hands

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
from the finest wood in the county.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,820
Gave it more love and care than my own child.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
Points out the window.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
"You see that stone wall out there?

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,820
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Points out the window.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,820
"You see that pier on the lake out there?

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
I built that pier with my bare hands.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,820
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
But you fuck one goat ... "

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:18,820
(Laughter)

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Storytelling --

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
(Laughter)

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,820
is joke telling.

28
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
It's knowing your punchline,

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
your ending,

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
is leading to a singular goal,

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
and ideally confirming some truth

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
that deepens our understandings

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
of who we are as human beings.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
We all love stories.

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
We're born for them.

37
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,820
Stories affirm who we are.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
And nothing does a greater affirmation

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
than when we connect through stories.

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
It can cross the barriers of time,

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
past, present and future,

43
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
and allow us to experience

44
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
the similarities between ourselves

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
and through others, real and imagined.

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
The children's television host Mr. Rogers

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
always carried in his wallet

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,820
a quote from a social worker

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,820
that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
once you've heard their story."

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
And the way I like to interpret that

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,820
is probably the greatest story commandment,

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
which is "Make me care" --

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
please, emotionally,

55
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
intellectually, aesthetically,

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,820
just make me care.

57
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
We all know what it's like to not care.

58
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
just switching channel after channel,

60
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
It's already halfway over,

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
That's not by chance,

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
that's by design.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,820
So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,

66
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
how I was born for it,

67
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
how I learned along the way this subject matter?

68
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
And to make it more interesting,

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
we'll start from the ending

70
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,820
and we'll go to the beginning.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
it would go something like this:

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
And that's what ultimately led me

74
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
to speaking to you here at TED

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
about story.

76
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
And the most current story lesson that I've had

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
was completing the film I've just done

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
this year in 2012.

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself

82
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion

84
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
with a telegram saying, "See me at once."

85
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
But once he gets there,

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,820
he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away

87
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,820
and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.

(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.

89
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Thing only opens from the inside.

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
He insisted,

91
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
no embalming, no open coffin,

92
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
no funeral.

93
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
by being like the rest of us, huh?

95
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Come, let's go inside.

96
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,

97
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is it's fundamentally making a promise.

98
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
It's making a promise to you

99
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.

100
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,820
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.

101
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.

102
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "

103
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.

104
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.

105
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,820
It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,

106
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.

107
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,

108
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
but it's going to be worth your time."

109
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
A well told promise

110
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,820
is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot

111
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
and propels you forward through the story

112
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
to the end.

113
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
In 2008,

114
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time

115
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
to the limits of my understanding on this project.

116

(Laughter)

123
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
AS: Storytelling without dialogue.

124
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.

125
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
It's the most inclusive approach you can take.

126
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on,

127
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
is that the audience

128
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
actually wants to work for their meal.

129
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
They just don't want to know that they're doing that.

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
That's your job as a storyteller,

131
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
is to hide the fact

132
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
that you're making them work for their meal.

133
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
We're born problem solvers.

134
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We're compelled to deduce

135
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
and to deduct,

136
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
because that's what we do in real life.

137
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
It's this well-organized absence of information

138
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
that draws us in.

139
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,820
There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.

140
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
It's not just that they're damn cute;

141
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
it's because they can't completely express

142
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
what they're thinking and what their intentions are.

143
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And it's like a magnet.

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
We can't stop ourselves

145
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I first started

147
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
really understanding this storytelling device

148
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."

149
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.

150
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Make the audience put things together.

151
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Don't give them four,

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
give them two plus two.

153
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
The elements you provide and the order you place them in

154
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.

155
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.

156
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
It's the invisible application

157
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
that holds our attention to story.

158
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
I don't mean to make it sound

159
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,820
like this is an actual exact science, it's not.

160
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
That's what's so special about stories,

161
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
they're not a widget, they aren't exact.

162
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Stories are inevitable, if they're good,

163
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
but they're not predictable.

164
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
I took a seminar in this year

165
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.

166
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
And I learned a key insight to character.

167
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
She believed that all well-drawn characters

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
have a spine.

169
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
And the idea is that the character has an inner motor,

170
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,

171
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
an itch that they can't scratch.

172
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,

173
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
and that probably his spine

175
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
was to please his father.

176
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
And it's something that always drove all his choices.

177
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Even after his father died,

178
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,820
he was still trying to scratch that itch.

179
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I took to this like a duck to water.

180
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Wall-E's was to find the beauty.

181
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"

182
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
was to prevent harm.

183
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.

184
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.

185
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.

186
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I'm really blessed to be a parent,

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe

188
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,

189
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
and you don't have any say about it,

190
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
and there's no changing it.

191
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
All you can do is learn to recognize it

192
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and own it.

193
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,

194
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
some are negative.

195
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
But a major threshold is passed

196
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
when you mature enough

197
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
to acknowledge what drives you

198
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
and to take the wheel and steer it.

199
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
As parents, you're always learning who your children are.

200
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
They're learning who they are.

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
And you're still learning who you are.

202
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
So we're all learning all the time.

203
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
And that's why change is fundamental in story.

204
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
If things go static, stories die,

205
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
because life is never static.

206
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
In 1998,

207
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.

209
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.

210
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
So I researched everything I possibly could.

211
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
And I finally came across this fantastic quote

212
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
by a British playwright, William Archer:

213
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
"Drama is anticipation

214
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
mingled with uncertainty."

215
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
It's an incredibly insightful definition.

216
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
When you're telling a story,

217
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
have you constructed anticipation?

218
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
In the short-term, have you made me want to know

219
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
what will happen next?

220
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
But more importantly,

221
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
have you made me want to know

222
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
how it will all conclude in the long-term?

223
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Have you constructed honest conflicts

224
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
with truth that creates doubt

225
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
in what the outcome might be?

226
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
An example would be in "Finding Nemo,"

227
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
in the short tension, you were always worried,

228
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
would Dory's short-term memory

229
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.

230
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
But under that was this global tension

231
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
of will we ever find Nemo

232
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
in this huge, vast ocean?

233
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
In our earliest days at Pixar,

234
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
before we truly understood the invisible workings of story,

235
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.

236
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
And it's interesting to see

237
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
how that led us places

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
that were actually pretty good.

239
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
You've got to remember that in this time of year,

240
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
1993,

241
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
what was considered a successful animated picture

242
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,"

243
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
"Aladdin," "Lion King."

244
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,

245
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
he walked in and he said,

246
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
"You don't want me to sing, do you?"

247
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
And I thought that epitomized perfectly

248
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,820
what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.

249
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
But we really wanted to prove

250
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,820
that you could tell stories completely different in animation.

251
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
We didn't have any influence then,

252
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
so we had a little secret list of rules

253
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
that we kept to ourselves.

254
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,820
And they were: No songs,

255
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
no "I want" moment,

256
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
no happy village,

257
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
no love story.

258
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
And the irony is that, in the first year,

259
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
our story was not working at all

260
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
and Disney was panicking.

261
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
So they privately got advice

262
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
from a famous lyricist, who I won't name,

263
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
and he faxed them some suggestions.

264
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
And we got a hold of that fax.

265
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
And the fax said,

266
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
there should be songs,

267
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
there should be an "I want" song,

268
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
there should be a happy village song,

269
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
there should be a love story

270
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
and there should be a villain.

271
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
And thank goodness

272
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.

273
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
That just gave us more determination

274
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
to prove that you could build a better story.

275
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
And a year after that, we did conquer it.

276
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
And it just went to prove

277
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
that storytelling has guidelines,

278
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
not hard, fast rules.

279
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Another fundamental thing we learned

280
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
was about liking your main character.

281
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
And we had naively thought,

282
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,

283
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
so you've got to start from someplace.

284
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,820
So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.

285
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?

286
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Off the bed.

287
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Hey, off the bed!

288
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Mr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?

289
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Woody: No, he is.

290
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky!

291
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Get up here and do your job.

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Are you deaf?

293
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
I said, take care of them.

294
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody,

295
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
but I have to agree with them.

296
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I don't think what you did was right.

297
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly?

298
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
You don't think I was right?

299
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?

300
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?

301
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
We realized, you can make him kind,

302
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
generous, funny, considerate,

303
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
as long as one condition is met for him,

304
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
is that he stays the top toy.

305
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
And that's what it really is,

306
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
is that we all live life conditionally.

307
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,

308
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
as long as certain conditions are met.

309
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
After that, all bets are off.

310
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,

311
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
I can now see key things that happened in my youth

312
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
that really sort of opened my eyes

313
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
to certain things about story.

314
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
In 1986, I truly understood the notion

315
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
of story having a theme.

316
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
And that was the year that they restored and re-released

317
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
"Lawrence of Arabia."

318
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
And I saw that thing seven times in one month.

319
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
I couldn't get enough of it.

320
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
I could just tell there was a grand design under it --

321
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
in every shot, every scene, every line.

322
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Yet, on the surface it just seemed

323
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
to be depicting his historical lineage

324
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
of what went on.

325
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Yet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?

326
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,

327
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
that the veil was lifted

328
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert

329
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and he's reached the Suez Canal,

330
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
and I suddenly got it.

331
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,820
(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

332
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Cyclist: Who are you?

333
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Who are you?

334
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
AS: That was the theme: Who are you?

335
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Here were all these seemingly disparate

336
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
events and dialogues

337
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
that just were chronologically telling the history of him,

338
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
but underneath it was a constant,

339
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
a guideline, a road map.

340
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Everything Lawrence did in that movie

341
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.

342
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
A strong theme is always running through

343
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
a well-told story.

344
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
When I was five,

345
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,820
I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient

346
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
that I feel a story should have,

347
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
but is rarely invoked.

348
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.

349
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.

350
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Look.

351
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
The water's stiff.

352
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Bambi: Yippee!

353
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Thumper: Some fun,

354
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
huh, Bambi?

355
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Come on. Get up.

356
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Like this.

357
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Ha ha. No, no, no.

358
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
AS: I walked out of there

359
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
wide-eyed with wonder.

360
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
And that's what I think the magic ingredient is,

361
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
the secret sauce,

362
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
is can you invoke wonder.

363
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.

364
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
It can't be artificially evoked.

365
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
For me, there's no greater ability

366
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling --

367
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,820
to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day

368
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
and have them surrender to wonder.

369
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,

370
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
it reaches you almost to a cellular level.

371
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
And when an artist does that to another artist,

372
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
it's like you're compelled to pass it on.

373
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
It's like a dormant command

374
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.

375
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Do unto others what's been done to you.

376
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
The best stories infuse wonder.

377
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
When I was four years old,

378
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
I have a vivid memory

379
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle

380
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
and asking my dad what they were.

381
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,

382
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
but I couldn't see them because of my hair.

383
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
And he explained that when I was born,

384
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
I was born premature,

385
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
that I came out much too early,

386
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
and I wasn't fully baked;

387
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
I was very, very sick.

388
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,

389
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
he looked straight at my mom and said,

390
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
"He's not going to live."

391
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,820
And I was in the hospital for months.

392
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
And many blood transfusions later,

393
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I lived,

394
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
and that made me special.

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
I don't know if I really believe that.

396
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I don't know if my parents really believe that,

397
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
but I didn't want to prove them wrong.

398
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Whatever I ended up being good at,

399
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,820
I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.

400
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,820
(Video) (Crying)

401
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Marlin: There, there, there.

402
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,820
It's okay, daddy's here.

403
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Daddy's got you.

404
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
I promise,

405
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,820
I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.

406
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,820
AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.

407
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Use what you know. Draw from it.

408
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
It doesn't always mean plot or fact.

409
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,

410
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
expressing values you personally feel

411
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
deep down in your core.

412
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you

413
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
here at TEDTalk today.

414
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Thank you.

415
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,820
(Applause)
