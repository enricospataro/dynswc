1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,298
Thank you. I have to tell you
I'm both challenged and excited.

2
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,234
My excitement is: I get a chance
to give something back.

3
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:23,796
My challenge is: the shortest seminar
I usually do is 50 hours.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,445
(Laughter)

5
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,699
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends

6
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,958
-- I do more, obviously,
I also coach people --

7
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:32,753
but I'm into immersion,
because how did you learn language?

8
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,382
Not just by learning principles,

9
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:37,259
you got in it and you did it
so often that it became real.

10
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,760
The bottom line of why I'm here,
besides being a crazy mofo, is that --

11
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:44,523
I'm not here to motivate you,
you don't need that, obviously.

12
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,570
Often that's what people think I do,

13
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,309
and it's the furthest thing from it.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,378
What happens, though, is people say to me,

15
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:51,870
"I don't need any motivation."

16
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:53,437
But that's not what I do.

17
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,328
I'm the "why" guy.

18
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:57,424
I want to know why you do what you do.

19
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,273
What is your motive for action?

20
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:03,133
What is it that drives you
in your life today? Not 10 years ago.

21
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:04,862
Are you running the same pattern?

22
00:01:04,886 --> 00:01:08,798
Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive, activated,

23
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,630
is the most important thing.

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,233
I'm here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.

25
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,074
All of us here have great minds.

26
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,526
Most of us here have great minds, right?

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,910
We all know how to think.

28
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,023
With our minds we can
rationalize anything.

29
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,389
We can make anything happen.

30
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,191
I agree with what was described
a few days ago,

31
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,542
that people work in their self-interest.

32
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,184
But we know that that's bullshit at times.

33
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,572
You don't work in your
self-interest all the time,

34
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,463
because when emotion comes into it,

35
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,530
the wiring changes
in the way it functions.

36
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:42,505
So it's wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is,

37
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:45,688
especially those who are very smart
can play this game in our head.

38
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,814
But I really want to know
what's driving you.

39
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:49,696
What I would like to invite you to do

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,226
by the end of this talk is explore
where you are today, for two reasons.

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,131
One: so that you can contribute more.

42
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:58,425
And two: that hopefully we can not just
understand other people more,

43
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:01,339
but appreciate them more,
and create the kinds of connections

44
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,286
that can stop some of the challenges
that we face today.

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,055
They're only going to get magnified
by the very technology that connects us,

46
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,865
because it's making us intersect.

47
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,115
That intersection
doesn't always create a view

48
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,325
of "everybody now understands everybody,

49
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,713
and everybody appreciates everybody."

50
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,328
I've had an obsession
basically for 30 years,

51
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:23,667
"What makes the difference
in the quality of people's lives?

52
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,148
What in their performance?"

53
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:27,350
I got hired to produce the result now.

54
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,870
I've done it for 30 years.

55
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,441
I get the phone call

56
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:33,207
when the athlete is burning down
on national television,

57
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:34,917
and they were ahead by five strokes

58
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,941
and now they can't get back on the course.

59
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:39,651
I've got to do something right now
or nothing matters.

60
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,647
I get the phone call when the child
is going to commit suicide,

61
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,118
I've got to do something.

62
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:47,796
In 29 years, I'm very grateful
to tell you I've never lost one.

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,324
It doesn't mean I won't some day,
but I haven't yet.

64
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:53,724
The reason is an understanding
of these human needs.

65
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:56,859
When I get those calls
about performance, that's one thing.

66
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,369
How do you make a change?

67
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:02,388
I'm also looking to see what is shaping
the person's ability to contribute,

68
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:05,922
to do something beyond themselves.

69
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:08,054
Maybe the real question is,

70
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,449
I look at life and say
there's two master lessons.

71
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,552
One is: there's the science
of achievement,

72
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,346
which almost everything that's run
is mastered amazingly.

73
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,865
"How do you take the invisible
and make it visible,"

74
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,606
How do you make your dreams happen?

75
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,217
Your business, your contribution
to society, money --

76
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,953
whatever, your body, your family.

77
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:27,480
The other lesson that is rarely
mastered is the art of fulfillment.

78
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,913
Because science is easy, right?

79
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:32,842
We know the rules, you write the code
and you get the results.

80
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:36,010
Once you know the game,
you just up the ante, don't you?

81
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:38,467
But when it comes to fulfillment
-- that's an art.

82
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,687
The reason is, it's about
appreciation and contribution.

83
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,796
You can only feel so much by yourself.

84
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,756
I've had an interesting laboratory
to try to answer the real question

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,336
how somebody's life changes

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,671
if you look at them like those people
that you've given everything to?

87
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,819
Like all the resources they say they need.

88
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,629
You gave not a 100-dollar computer,
but the best computer.

89
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,175
You gave them love, joy,
were there to comfort them.

90
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,795
Those people very often
-- you know some of them --

91
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,260
end up the rest of their life

92
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,709
with all this love, education,
money and background

93
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,117
going in and out of rehab.

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,796
Some people have been
through ultimate pain,

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,195
psychologically, sexually,
spiritually, emotionally abused --

96
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,875
and not always, but often,

97
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,103
they become some of the people
that contribute the most to society.

98
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:24,059
The question we've got to ask
ourselves really is, what is it?

99
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,426
What is it that shapes us?

100
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,061
We live in a therapy culture.

101
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:30,127
Most of us don't do that,
but the culture's a therapy culture,

102
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:32,140
the mindset that we are our past.

103
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,796
And you wouldn't be in this room
if you bought that,

104
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,998
but most of society
thinks biography is destiny.

105
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,665
The past equals the future.

106
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,404
Of course it does if you live there.

107
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,096
But what we know and what
we have to remind ourselves --

108
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,314
because you can know
something intellectually

109
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,186
and then not use it, not apply it.

110
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,448
We've got to remind ourselves
that decision is the ultimate power.

111
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:55,176
When you ask people,

112
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,073
have you failed to achieve
something significant in your life?

113
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,796
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

114
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,796
TR: Thanks for the interaction
on a high level there.

115
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,796
But if you ask people,
why didn't you achieve something?

116
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,075
Somebody who's working for you,
or a partner, or even yourself.

117
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,195
When you fail to achieve,
what's the reason people say?

118
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,362
What do they tell you?

119
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,796
Didn't have the --

120
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,695
Didn't have the knowledge,
didn't have the money,

121
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,956
didn't have the time,
didn't have the technology.

122
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,814
I didn't have the right manager.

123
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:27,527
Al Gore: Supreme Court.
TR: The Supreme Court.

124
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,781
(Laughter)

125
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:32,353
(Applause) (Cheering)

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,796
(Applause continues)

127
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,875
TR: And --

128
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,797
(Applause)

129
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,917
What do all those, including
the Supreme Court, have in common?

130
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,315
(Laughter)

131
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:57,139
They are a claim to you missing
resources, and they may be accurate.

132
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,796
You may not have the money,
or the Supreme Court,

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,796
but that is not the defining factor.

134
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,777
(Applause) (Laughter)

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,344
And you correct me if I'm wrong.

136
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,796
The defining factor is never resources;
it's resourcefulness.

137
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,624
And what I mean specifically,
rather than just some phrase,

138
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:19,860
is if you have emotion, human emotion,

139
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:23,913
something that I experienced from you
the day before yesterday

140
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:26,528
at a level that is as profound
as I've ever experienced

141
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,790
and I believe with that emotion
you would have beat his ass and won.

142
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:30,871
Audience: Yeah!

143
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:35,562
(Applause) (Cheering)

144
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,796
How easy for me to tell him
what he should do.

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,796
(Laughter)

146
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,707
Idiot, Robbins.

147
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:47,987
But I know when we watched
the debate at that time,

148
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,298
there were emotions
that blocked people's ability

149
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,299
to get this man's intellect and capacity.

150
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,219
And the way that it came across
to some people on that day --

151
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:58,618
because I know people that wanted
to vote in your direction and didn't,

152
00:06:58,642 --> 00:06:59,985
and I was upset.

153
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,448
But there was emotion there.

154
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,177
Do you know what I'm talking about?

155
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,535
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

156
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,699
TR: So, emotion is it.

157
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:09,473
And if we get the right emotion,
we can get ourselves to do anything.

158
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,417
If you're creative, playful, fun enough,

159
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,511
can you get through to anybody, yes or no?

160
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:14,979
If you don't have the money,

161
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,532
but you're creative and determined,
you find the way.

162
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,039
This is the ultimate resource.

163
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,296
But this is not the story
that people tell us.

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,396
They tell us a bunch of different stories.

165
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,129
They tell us we don't have
the resources, but ultimately,

166
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,717
if you take a look here,

167
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:31,083
they say, what are all the reasons
they haven't accomplished that?

168
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:33,368
He's broken my pattern,
that son-of-a-bitch.

169
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:36,719
(Laughter)

170
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,097
But I appreciated the energy,
I'll tell you that.

171
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,198
(Laughter)

172
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,739
What determines your resources?

173
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:44,900
We've said decisions shape destiny,
which is my focus here.

174
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:48,020
If decisions shape destiny,
what determines it is three decisions.

175
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:49,197
What will you focus on?

176
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,672
You have to decide
what you're going to focus on.

177
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:53,157
Consciously or unconsciously.

178
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,092
the minute you decide to focus,
you must give it a meaning,

179
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,005
and that meaning produces emotion.

180
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,855
Is this the end or the beginning?

181
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,778
Is God punishing me or rewarding me,
or is this the roll of the dice?

182
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,796
An emotion creates
what we're going to do, or the action.

183
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,796
So, think about your own life,

184
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,868
the decisions that
have shaped your destiny.

185
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,878
And that sounds really heavy,
but in the last five or 10 years,

186
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:15,449
have there been some decisions

187
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:19,310
that if you'd made a different decision,
your life would be completely different?

188
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:22,028
How many can think about it?
Better or worse. Say, "Aye."

189
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,084
Audience: Aye.

190
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,772
So the bottom line is,
maybe it was where to go to work,

191
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,649
and you met the love of your life there,
a career decision.

192
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,639
I know the Google geniuses I saw here --

193
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:34,051
I mean, I understand that their decision
was to sell their technology.

194
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:37,216
What if they made that decision
versus to build their own culture?

195
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,169
How would the world or their lives
be different, their impact?

196
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:42,310
The history of our world
is these decisions.

197
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,896
When a woman stands up and says,
"No, I won't go to the back of the bus."

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,439
She didn't just affect her life.
That decision shaped our culture.

199
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,982
Or someone standing in front of a tank.

200
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,796
Or being in a position
like Lance Armstrong,

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,364
"You've got testicular cancer."

202
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,427
That's pretty tough for any male,
especially if you ride a bike.

203
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,796
(Laughter)

204
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,529
You've got it in your brain;
you've got it in your lungs.

205
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,745
But what was his decision
of what to focus on?

206
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,908
Different than most people.
What did it mean?

207
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,883
It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.

208
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,698
He goes off and wins
seven championships he never once won

209
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:16,604
before the cancer, because he got
emotional fitness, psychological strength.

210
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:19,119
That's the difference
in human beings that I've seen

211
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,002
of the three million I've been around.

212
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:26,811
In my lab, I've had three million people
from 80 countries over the last 29 years.

213
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,299
And after a while,
patterns become obvious.

214
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:33,322
You see that South America and Africa
may be connected in a certain way, right?

215
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,964
Others say, "Oh, that sounds
ridiculous." It's simple.

216
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:38,272
So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?

217
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:42,618
Two invisible forces.
Very quickly. One: state.

218
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,796
We all have had times,

219
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,613
you did something, and after,
you thought to yourself,

220
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:49,796
"I can't believe I said or did that,
that was so stupid."

221
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,915
Who's been there? Say, "Aye."
Audience: Aye.

222
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,335
Or after you did something,
you go, "That was me!"

223
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,796
(Laughter)

224
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,654
It wasn't your ability; it was your state.

225
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,598
Your model of the world
is what shapes you long term.

226
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:05,154
Your model of the world is the filter.
That's what's shaping us.

227
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,778
It makes people make decisions.

228
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:10,058
To influence somebody, we need to know
what already influences them.

229
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,891
It's made up of three parts.

230
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,254
First, what's your target?
What are you after?

231
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:15,796
It's not your desires.

232
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,455
You can get your desires or goals.

233
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,693
Who has ever got a goal or desire
and thought, is this all there is?

234
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:21,970
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

235
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:24,862
It's needs we have. I believe
there are six human needs.

236
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,796
Second, once you know what the target
that's driving you is

237
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,796
and you uncover it for the truth --
you don't form it --

238
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,555
then you find out what's your map,

239
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,640
what's the belief systems
that tell you how to get those needs.

240
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:38,615
Some people think the way
to get them is to destroy the world,

241
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,189
some people, to build,
create something, love someone.

242
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,796
There's the fuel you pick.
So very quickly, six needs.

243
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,291
Let me tell you what they are.
First one: certainty.

244
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,778
These are not goals or desires,
these are universal.

245
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,902
Everyone needs certainty
they can avoid pain

246
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:52,343
and at least be comfortable.

247
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,621
Now, how do you get it?

248
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,730
Control everybody? Develop a skill?
Give up? Smoke a cigarette?

249
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,796
And if you got totally
certain, ironically,

250
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,106
even though we need that --

251
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,323
you're not certain about your health,
or your children, or money.

252
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:05,562
If you're not sure
the ceiling will hold up,

253
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,205
you won't listen to any speaker.

254
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:10,978
While we go for certainty differently,
if we get total certainty, we get what?

255
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,696
What do you feel if you're certain?

256
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,373
You know what will happen,
when and how it will happen,

257
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:16,496
what would you feel?

258
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,196
Bored out of your minds.
So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,

259
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,796
gave us a second human need,
which is uncertainty.

260
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,796
We need variety. We need surprise.

261
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,116
How many of you here
love surprises? Say, "Aye."

262
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,221
Audience: Aye.

263
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,856
TR: Bullshit. You like
the surprises you want.

264
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,224
The ones you don't want,
you call problems, but you need them.

265
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:36,027
So, variety is important.

266
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:39,163
Have you ever rented a video
or a film that you've already seen?

267
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:40,996
Who's done this? Get a fucking life.

268
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,796
(Laughter)

269
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,430
Why are you doing it?

270
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,237
You're certain it's good
because you read or saw it before,

271
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,955
but you're hoping it's been
long enough you've forgotten,

272
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:50,996
and there's variety.

273
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,056
Third human need, critical: significance.

274
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,355
We all need to feel important,
special, unique.

275
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,246
You can get it by making more money
or being more spiritual.

276
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,186
You can do it by getting yourself
in a situation where you put

277
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,196
more tattoos and earrings in places
humans don't want to know.

278
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,285
Whatever it takes.

279
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,596
The fastest way to do this,

280
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,596
if you have no background,
no culture, no belief and resources

281
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,259
or resourcefulness, is violence.

282
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:15,043
If I put a gun to your head and I live
in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.

283
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,528
Zero to 10. How high? 10.

284
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,638
How certain am I that
you're going to respond to me? 10.

285
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,778
How much uncertainty?

286
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,496
Who knows what's going to happen next?
Kind of exciting.

287
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,896
Like climbing up into a cave
and doing that stuff

288
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
all the way down there.

289
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,686
Total variety and uncertainty.

290
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,096
And it's significant, isn't it?
So you want to risk your life for it.

291
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,196
So that's why violence has always
been around and will be around

292
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,677
unless we have a consciousness
change as a species.

293
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,696
You can get significance a million ways,

294
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,619
but to be significant, you've got
to be unique and different.

295
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:45,625
Here's what we really need:
connection and love, fourth need.

296
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,696
We all want it;

297
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,899
most settle for connection,
love's too scary.

298
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:51,400
Who here has been hurt
in an intimate relationship?

299
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,256
If you don't raise your hand,
you've had other shit, too.

300
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,003
And you're going to get hurt again.

301
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:58,287
Aren't you glad you came
to this positive visit?

302
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,831
Here's what's true: we need it.

303
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:03,231
We can do it through
intimacy, friendship, prayer,

304
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:04,602
through walking in nature.

305
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:07,458
If nothing else works for you,
don't get a cat, get a dog,

306
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:11,077
because if you leave for two minutes,
it's like you've been gone six months,

307
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,787
when you come back 5 minutes later.

308
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,486
These first four needs,
every human finds a way to meet.

309
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,720
Even if you lie to yourself,
you need to have split personalities.

310
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:23,283
I call the first four needs
the needs of the personality.

311
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:26,041
The last two are the needs of the spirit.

312
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,832
And this is where fulfillment comes.

313
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:29,651
You won't get it from the first four.

314
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,961
You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,
do whatever, meet the first four.

315
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,561
But number five, you must grow.

316
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:35,714
We all know the answer.

317
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:37,261
If you don't grow, you're what?

318
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,394
If a relationship or business
is not growing,

319
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,555
if you're not growing,

320
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,982
doesn't matter how much
money or friends you have,

321
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,182
how many love you,

322
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,449
you feel like hell.

323
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:47,064
And I believe the reason we grow

324
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,048
is so we have something to give of value.

325
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:51,783
Because the sixth need
is to contribute beyond ourselves.

326
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:53,884
Because we all know, corny as that sounds,

327
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,494
the secret to living is giving.

328
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,802
We all know life is not about me,
it's about we.

329
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,065
This culture knows that,
this room knows that.

330
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,166
It's exciting.

331
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,784
When you see Nicholas
talking about his $100 computer,

332
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,147
the most exciting thing is:

333
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,586
here's a genius,
but he's got a calling now.

334
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,482
You can feel the difference in him,
and it's beautiful.

335
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,449
And that calling can touch other people.

336
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:15,350
My life was touched
because when I was 11 years old,

337
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,361
Thanksgiving, no money, no food,

338
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:18,796
we were not going to starve,

339
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,535
but my father was totally messed up,

340
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,890
my mom was letting him know
how bad he messed up,

341
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,269
and somebody came to the door
and delivered food.

342
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:28,353
My father made three decisions,
I know what they were, briefly.

343
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,202
His focus was "This is charity.

344
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:31,892
What does it mean? I'm worthless.

345
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,541
What do I have to do?
Leave my family," which he did.

346
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,047
It was one of the most painful
experiences of life.

347
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:39,240
My three decisions
gave me a different path.

348
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,938
I set focus on "There's food."
What a concept!

349
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,039
(Laughter)

350
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:47,258
But this is what changed my life,
shaped me as a human being.

351
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:49,475
Somebody's gift,
I don't even know who it is.

352
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,759
My father always said,
"No one gives a shit."

353
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,119
And now somebody I don't know,

354
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,677
they're not asking for anything,
just giving us food,

355
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:57,878
looking out for us.

356
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,541
It made me believe this:
that strangers care.

357
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:02,679
And that made me decide,

358
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,770
if strangers care about me and my family,
I care about them.

359
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:08,010
I'm going to do something
to make a difference.

360
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,131
So when I was 17,
I went out on Thanksgiving,

361
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,408
it was my target for years to have
enough money to feed two families.

362
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:15,897
The most fun and moving thing
I ever did in my life.

363
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,604
Next year, I did four, then eight.

364
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:21,363
I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,
I wasn't doing it for brownie points.

365
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,773
But after eight,
I thought I could use some help.

366
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,225
So I went out, got my friends involved,

367
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:29,426
then I grew companies, got 11,
and I built the foundation.

368
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,644
18 years later,

369
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,114
I'm proud to tell you last year we fed
2 million people in 35 countries

370
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,322
through our foundation.

371
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,679
All during the holidays,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

372
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,706
in different countries around the world.

373
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,831
(Applause)

374
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:42,001
Thank you.

375
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,597
I don't tell you that to brag,
but because I'm proud of human beings

376
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:47,528
because they get excited to contribute

377
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:50,661
once they've had the chance
to experience it, not talk about it.

378
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:52,476
So, finally -- I'm about out of time.

379
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,359
The target that shapes you --

380
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:57,242
Here's what's different about people.

381
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,451
We have the same needs.

382
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:01,342
But are you a certainty freak,
is that what you value most,

383
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,543
or uncertainty?

384
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:06,108
This man couldn't be a certainty freak
if he climbed through those caves.

385
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,013
Are you driven by significance or love?

386
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,313
We all need all six,

387
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:12,421
but what your lead system is
tilts you in a different direction.

388
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,581
And as you move in a direction,
you have a destination or destiny.

389
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,030
The second piece is the map.

390
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:19,330
The operating system
tells you how to get there,

391
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,635
and some people's map is,

392
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,430
"I'm going to save lives
even if I die for other people,"

393
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:24,630
and they're a fireman,

394
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,570
and somebody else says,
"I'm going to kill people to do it."

395
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,172
They're trying to meet
the same needs of significance.

396
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,389
They want to honor God
or honor their family.

397
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,935
But they have a different map.

398
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,838
And there are seven different beliefs;
I can't go through them, because I'm done.

399
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,191
The last piece is emotion.

400
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,216
One of the parts of the map is like time.

401
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,529
Some people's idea
of a long time is 100 years.

402
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,228
Somebody else's is three seconds,
which is what I have.

403
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:49,023
And the last one I've already mentioned
that fell to you.

404
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,770
If you've got a target and a map --

405
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,727
I can't use Google because I love Macs,

406
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,847
and they haven't made it
good for Macs yet.

407
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,152
So if you use MapQuest --

408
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,591
how many have made
this fatal mistake of using it?

409
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,711
You use this thing
and you don't get there.

410
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,371
Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
you can never get to where you want to go.

411
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:05,472
(Laughter)

412
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:06,830
The last thing is emotion.

413
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,858
Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.

414
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:10,357
There are 6,000 emotions

415
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,670
that we have words for
in the English language,

416
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,850
which is just a linguistic representation
that changes by language.

417
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:18,174
But if your dominant emotions --

418
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,925
If I have 20,000 people or 1,000

419
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,001
and I have them write down
all the emotions that they experience

420
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,026
in an average week,

421
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,980
and I give them as long as they need,

422
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,293
and on one side
they write empowering emotions,

423
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,632
the other's disempowering,

424
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:33,183
guess how many emotions
they experience? Less than 12.

425
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,303
And half of those
make them feel like shit.

426
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,752
They have six good feelings.

427
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,416
Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,

428
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,683
frustrated, frustrated,
overwhelmed, depressed.

429
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,180
How many of you know somebody

430
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,975
who, no matter what happens,
finds a way to get pissed off?

431
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,179
(Laughter)

432
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:50,544
Or no matter what happens,
they find a way to be happy or excited.

433
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,572
How many of you know somebody like this?

434
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:55,542
When 9/11 happened, I'll finish
with this, I was in Hawaii.

435
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,229
I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,

436
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,639
we were translating
four languages simultaneously

437
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,783
for a program I was conducting,
for a week.

438
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,336
The night before was called
Emotional Mastery.

439
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,745
I got up, had no plan
for this, and I said --

440
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,867
we had fireworks,
I do crazy shit, fun stuff,

441
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,172
and at the end, I stopped.

442
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,919
I had this plan, but I never know
what I'm going to say.

443
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,368
And all of a sudden, I said,

444
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:19,440
"When do people really start to live?
When they face death."

445
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,172
And I went through this whole thing

446
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,678
about, if you weren't going
to get off this island,

447
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,895
if nine days from now,
you were going to die,

448
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,738
who would you call,
what would you say, what would you do?

449
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:30,430
That night is when 9/11 happened.

450
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:33,320
One woman had come to the seminar,
and when she came there,

451
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:36,019
her previous boyfriend had been
kidnapped and murdered.

452
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,718
Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,
and she said no.

453
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,099
He said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing,
it's over with us."

454
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,359
She said, "It's over."

455
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:46,348
When I finished that night,
she called him and left a message

456
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,336
at the top of the World Trade Center
where he worked, saying,

457
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,889
"I love you, I want you to know
I want to marry you.

458
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,317
It was stupid of me."

459
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,739
She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.
for us, when he called her back,

460
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:59,643
and said, "Honey, I can't tell you
what this means.

461
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:03,016
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you gave me the greatest gift,

462
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,397
because I'm going to die."

463
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:07,322
And she played the recording
for us in the room.

464
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,771
She was on Larry King later.

465
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,751
And he said, "You're probably wondering

466
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,867
how on Earth this could
happen to you twice.

467
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,373
All I can say is this must be
God's message to you.

468
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:17,928
From now on, every day,
give your all, love your all.

469
00:19:17,952 --> 00:19:19,931
Don't let anything ever stop you."

470
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,770
She finishes, and a man
stands up, and he says,

471
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,370
"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.

472
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:26,587
I'd love to hold your hand
and say I'm sorry,

473
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,825
but frankly, this is retribution."

474
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,433
I can't tell you the rest,
because I'm out of time.

475
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:39,115
(Laughter)

476
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:40,315
Are you sure?

477
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,635
(Laughter)

478
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:45,835
10 seconds!

479
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,167
(Laughter and applause)

480
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,138
10 seconds, I want to be respectful.

481
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,298
All I can tell you is,

482
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:53,929
I brought this man on stage

483
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:56,894
with a man from New York who worked
in the World Trade Center,

484
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,918
because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.

485
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:01,377
More than 50 lost
their entire companies, friends,

486
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,923
marking off their Palm Pilots.

487
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:05,525
One financial trader,
woman made of steel, bawling --

488
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,374
30 friends crossing off that all died.

489
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,704
And I said, "What are we
going to focus on?

490
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,730
What does this mean
and what are we going to do?"

491
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,826
And I got the group to focus on:

492
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,566
if you didn't lose somebody today,

493
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,168
your focus is going to be
how to serve somebody else.

494
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:23,300
Then one woman stood up
and was so angry, screaming and yelling.

495
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:26,240
I found out she wasn't from New York,
she's not an American,

496
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,593
doesn't know anybody here.

497
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,379
I asked, "Do you always get angry?"

498
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,580
She said, "Yes."

499
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,796
Guilty people got guilty,
sad people got sad.

500
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,495
I took these two men
and I did an indirect negotiation.

501
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,904
Jewish man with family
in the occupied territory,

502
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:41,182
someone in New York who would have died
if he was at work that day,

503
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,306
and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,

504
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,610
and I made it very clear.

505
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:47,551
This integration is on a film,
which I'd be happy to send you,

506
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,001
instead of my verbalization,

507
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,125
but the two of them not only came together

508
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,583
and changed their beliefs
and models of the world,

509
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,329
but worked together to bring,
for almost four years now,

510
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,232
through various mosques and synagogues,

511
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,874
the idea of how to create peace.

512
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,561
And he wrote a book, called
"My Jihad, My Way of Peace."

513
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,108
So, transformation can happen.

514
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,356
My invitation to you is:

515
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,911
explore your web,

516
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,485
the web in here --

517
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:12,097
the needs, the beliefs, the emotions
that are controlling you,

518
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,298
for two reasons:

519
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,619
so there's more of you to give,
and achieve, too,

520
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:16,931
but I mean give,

521
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:19,008
because that's what's
going to fill you up.

522
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:20,860
And secondly, so you can appreciate --

523
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:23,703
not just understand,
that's intellectual, that's the mind,

524
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,825
but appreciate
what's driving other people.

525
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:28,090
It's the only way
our world's going to change.

526
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:30,692
God bless you, thank you.
I hope this was of service.

527
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:32,325
(Applause)
