1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
among the smartest of the smart.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
There's a Jewish saying that I love.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,820
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,820
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,820
about our common humanity.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
All stories interest me, and some haunt me

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
until I end up writing them.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Certain themes keep coming up:

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,820
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
freedom.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
I'm aware of the mystery around us,

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
so I write about coincidences, premonitions,

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,820
emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,820
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,820
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,820
(Laughter)

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,

24
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,820
of the opening ceremony,

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
called me and said that I had been selected

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
to be one of the flag-bearers.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
without a walker.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
(Laughter)

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
I was told that this was no laughing matter.

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
This would be the first time

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
that only women would carry the Olympic flag.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Five women, representing five continents,

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and three Olympic gold medal winners.

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
My first question was, naturally,

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
what was I going to wear?

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
(Laughter)

40
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
A uniform, she said,

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,820
and asked for my measurements.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
My measurements.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,

44
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
looking like the Michelin Man.

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,820
(Laughter)

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
By the middle of February,

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds

48
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,820
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.

50
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,820
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,

52
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
can determine the result of a race or a game.

53
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.

55
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
It is all about passion.

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,820
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters

57
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
announcing the slogan of the Olympics.

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,820
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.

60
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,820
That is what I need for my characters in my books:

61
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
a passionate heart.

62
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,820
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,820
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
People like all of you in this room.

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.

66
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
(Laughter)

67
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
They only make good former spouses.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
(Laughter)

69
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
(Applause)

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,820
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.

72
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Also, two women with passionate hearts:

73
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya

74
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,

75
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,820
she has changed the soil, the weather,

76
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,820
in some places in Africa, and of course

77
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
the economic conditions in many villages.

78
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,820
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately

79
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
against child prostitution.

80
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,

84
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
15 clients per day,

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.

86
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
In the green room I received my uniform.

87
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,

88
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit

89
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.

90
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I looked like a refrigerator.

91
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
(Laughter)

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,820
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.

96
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?

97
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
I don't know.

98
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"

99
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,820
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,

100
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
and I don't make old people's noises."

101
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
(Laughter)

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
So, there you have some free advice

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.

104
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

106
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
(Laughter)

107
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Well, she didn't say that exactly.

108
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
(Laughter)

109
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
At some point around midnight,

110
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,820
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --

112
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
by the way, the same music that starts here,

113
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
the Aida March.

114
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,

115
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
not counting the poofy hair.

116
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,820
(Laughter)

117
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,

118
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,820
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind

119
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
(Laughter)

120
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,820
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.

122
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
(Laughter)

123
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.

124
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos

125
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,820
I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.

126
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
(Laughter)

127
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,820
A place where most men would love to be.

128
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
(Laughter)

129
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
(Applause)

130
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,820
The best four minutes of my entire life

131
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
were those in the Olympic stadium.

132
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
My husband is offended when I say this --

133
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,820
although I have explained to him that what we do in private

134
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
usually takes less than four minutes --

135
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
(Laughter)

136
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
-- so he shouldn't take it personally.

137
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,820
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,

138
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
because I don't want to forget them

139
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
when old age destroys my brain cells.

140
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --

141
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
passion.

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
So here's a tale of passion.

143
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp

144
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

145
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,820
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world

146
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
are women and girls.

147
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,820
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.

149
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
The protagonists of this story

150
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.

151
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
She's pregnant and a widow.

152
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Soldiers have forced her to watch

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
as her husband was tortured and killed.

154
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,

155
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.

156
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
Two tiny little boys.

157
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,

158
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
and ties it with her own hair.

159
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
She names the twins after the camp's commanders

160
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea

161
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
because her milk cannot sustain them.

162
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,

163
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,

164
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
even when they hold a gun to her head.

165
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,

166
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,820
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart

167
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,820
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,

168
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,

169
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,

170
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
where they're now living and thriving.

171
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.

172
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women

173
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
like Rose Mapendo.

174
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.

175
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I look around and I see them everywhere.

176
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
I have worked with women and for women all my life.

177
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
I know them well.

178
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,

179
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,820
in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.

180
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,820
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --

181
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
although the term had not reached Chile yet,

182
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.

183
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
(Laughter)

184
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,820
for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.

186
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,820
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,

187
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
I was able to deliver two.

188
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
(Laughter)

189
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,

190
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,820
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.

191
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?

192
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,

193
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world

194
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
who are still forced into premature marriage,

195
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
prostitution, forced labor --

196
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.

197
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.

198
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
They have no education and no freedom.

199
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,820
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.

200
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
For most Western young women of today,

201
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
being called a feminist is an insult.

202
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you

203
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
that it never stopped me from flirting,

204
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.

205
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
(Laughter)

206
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

207
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,

208
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
change it, for Goddess' sake.

209
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;

210
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
the name doesn't matter,

211
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,820
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.

212
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,820
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.

213
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.

214
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
The year is 2005.

215
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist

216
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer

217
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
during her three-week vacation.

218
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
She's prepared to clean teeth,

219
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,

220
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,820
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.

221
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Outside, there is a line of women

222
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,820
who have waited several hours to be treated.

223
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
The first patient is in excruciating pain

224
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
because she has several rotten molars.

225
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.

226
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.

227
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
She risks a lot and she's terrified.

228
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,

229
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.

230
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

231
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,820
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.

232
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.

233
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.

234
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,820
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,

235
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.

236
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

237
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.

238
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.

239
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Jenny is horrified at what she has done,

240
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
but then the translator explains

241
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,820
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.

242
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home

243
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,820
in time to prepare dinner for him.

244
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Millions of women live like this today.

245
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
They are the poorest of the poor.

246
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,

247
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.

248
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
They are paid less than men for the same work

249
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,820
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable

250
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
because they have no economic independence,

251
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,

252
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
violence and abuse.

253
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
It is a fact that giving women education, work,

254
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
the ability to control their own income,

255
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,820
inherit and own property, benefits the society.

256
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
If a woman is empowered,

257
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
her children and her family will be better off.

258
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
If families prosper, the village prospers,

259
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
and eventually so does the whole country.

260
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.

261
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,820
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren

262
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
because they have cut and sold the trees.

263
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,

264
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
drop by drop.

265
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,

266
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.

267
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
The poorest and most backward societies

268
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
are always those that put women down.

269
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments

270
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
and also by philanthropy.

271
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
For every dollar given to a women's program,

272
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
20 dollars are given to men's programs.

273
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Women are 51 percent of humankind.

274
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Empowering them will change everything --

275
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,820
more than technology and design and entertainment.

276
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,820
I can promise you that women working together --

277
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
linked, informed and educated --

278
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,820
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.

279
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,820
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,

280
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.

281
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.

282
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
What kind of world do we want?

283
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,820
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.

284
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?

285
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
We want a world where life is preserved

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,

287
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
not only for the privileged.

288
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,820
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings

289
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,820
at the UC Berkeley library.

290
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,820
No museum or gallery in the United States,

291
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,820
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,

292
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
has dared to show the paintings because the theme

293
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
is the Abu Ghraib prison.

294
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,820
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,

295
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
in the voluminous Botero style.

296
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind

297
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
or my heart.

298
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
What I fear most is power with impunity.

299
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.

300
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
In our species, the alpha males define reality,

301
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality

302
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
and follow the rules.

303
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,

304
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,

305
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
which does not work in economics, works perfectly.

306
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.

307
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.

308
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --

309
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
a woman or a child.

310
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many

311
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
through gender, income, race, and class.

312
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,820
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes

313
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
in our civilization.

314
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
But for real change, we need feminine energy

315
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
in the management of the world.

316
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,

317
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.

318
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.

319
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

320
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,820
(Laughter)

321
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs

322
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
and legendary breasts.

323
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,820
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts

324
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,820
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.

325
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
I want to make this world good.

326
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Not better, but to make it good.

327
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --

328
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.

329
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves

330
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
and get to work, passionately,

331
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,820
in creating an almost perfect world.

332
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Thank you.
