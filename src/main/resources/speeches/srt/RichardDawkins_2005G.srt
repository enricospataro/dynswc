1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,820
My title: "Queerer than we can suppose: The strangeness of science."

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
"Queerer than we can suppose" comes from J.B.S. Haldane,

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
the famous biologist, who said, "Now, my own suspicion is

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,820
that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose,

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
but queerer than we can suppose.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,820
than are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy."

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories --

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,820
to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,820
This means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
that even Feynman himself was moved to remark,

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
"If you think you understand quantum theory,

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
you don't understand quantum theory."

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,820
It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
paradoxical interpretation of it.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,820
David Deutsch, who's talking here, in "The Fabric of Reality,"

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,820
embraces the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum theory,

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
because the worst that you can say about it is

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
that it's preposterously wasteful.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,820
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,820
existing in parallel -- mutually undetectable except through

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,820
the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
And that's Richard Feynman.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
The biologist Lewis Wolpert

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
believes that the queerness of modern physics

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,820
is just an extreme example. Science, as opposed to technology,

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
does violence to common sense.

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Every time you drink a glass of water, he points out,

32
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,820
the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,820
that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell. (Laughter)

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
It's just elementary probability theory.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
than the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world --

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,820
and, of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,820
or bladders. You have just breathed in a nitrogen atom

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon

40
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
to the left of the tall cycad tree.

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
"Queerer than we can suppose."

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything,

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose?

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Are there things about the universe that will be

45
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,820
forever beyond our grasp, but not beyond the grasp of some

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
superior intelligence? Are there things about the universe

47
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
that are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind,

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
however superior?

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
The history of science has been one long series

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
of violent brainstorms, as successive generations

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness

52
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
in the universe.

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins --

54
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
rather than the Sun moves across the sky -- it's hard for us to realize

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,820
what a shattering mental revolution that must have been.

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
After all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless,

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,820
the Sun small and mobile. But it's worth recalling

58
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Wittgenstein's remark on the subject.

59
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,820
"Tell me," he asked a friend, "why do people always say, it was natural

60
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,820
for man to assume that the sun went round the earth

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
rather than that the earth was rotating?"

62
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,820
His friend replied, "Well, obviously because it just looks as though

63
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
the Sun is going round the Earth."

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Wittgenstein replied, "Well, what would it have looked like

65
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:12,820
if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?" (Laughter)

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Science has taught us, against all intuition,

67
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,820
that apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks,

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,820
are really almost entirely composed of empty space.

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,820
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly

70
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom

71
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is in the next sports stadium.

72
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
So it would seem the hardest, solidest, densest rock

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,820
is really almost entirely empty space, broken only by tiny particles

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
so widely spaced they shouldn't count.

75
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Why, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable?

76
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,820
As an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved

77
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,820
in the world of atoms.

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
If we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks

81
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,820
as full of empty space. Rocks feel hard and impenetrable

82
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,820
to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,820
cannot penetrate each other. It's therefore useful

84
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,820
for our brains to construct notions like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"

85
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,820
because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,820
the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Moving to the other end of the scale, our ancestors never had to

88
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to

89
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
the speed of light. If they had, our brains would be much better

90
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,820
at understanding Einstein. I want to give the name "Middle World"

91
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved

92
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
the ability to take act -- nothing to do with Middle Earth.

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Middle World. (Laughter)

94
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,820
We are evolved denizens of Middle World, and that limits

95
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy

96
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
to grasp ideas like, when a rabbit moves at the sort of

97
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move,

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and hits another Middle World object, like a rock, it knocks itself out.

99
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,820
May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III,

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,820
commander of military intelligence in 1983.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,820
He stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it.

102
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,820
As frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office.

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
He stood up, and moved out from behind his desk.

104
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,820
What is the atom mostly made of? he thought. Space.

105
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,820
He started walking. What am I mostly made of? Atoms.

106
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
He quickened his pace, almost to a jog now.

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,820
What is the wall mostly made of? Atoms.

108
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
All I have to do is merge the spaces.

109
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Then, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall

110
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,820
of his office. Stubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers,

111
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall.

112
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
He has no doubt that this ability will, one day, be a common tool

113
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
in the military arsenal. Who would screw around with an army

114
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,820
that could do that? That's from an article in Playboy,

115
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
which I was reading the other day. (Laughter)

116
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
I have every reason to think it's true; I was reading Playboy

117
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:53,820
because I, myself, had an article in it. (Laughter)

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Unaided human intuition schooled in Middle World

119
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us

120
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
a heavy object and a light object, air friction aside,

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
would hit the ground at the same instant.

122
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,820
And that's because in Middle World, air friction is always there.

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
If we'd evolved in a vacuum, we would expect them

124
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
to hit the ground simultaneously. If we were bacteria,

125
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules,

126
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
it would be different,

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
but we Middle Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion.

128
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
In the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity

129
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension.

130
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
A small insect would reverse these priorities.

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left,

132
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Douglas Adams is on the right -- Steve Grand, in his book,

133
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,820
"Creation: Life and How to Make It," is positively scathing

134
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
about our preoccupation with matter itself.

135
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,820
We have this tendency to think that only solid, material things

136
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,820
are really things at all. Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation

137
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
in a vacuum seem unreal.

138
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium:

139
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,820
the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because

140
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
we've evolved to survive in Middle World,

141
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
where matter is a useful fiction.

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality

143
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
as a rock.

144
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,820
In a desert plain in Tanzania, in the shadow of the volcano

145
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Ol Donyo Lengai, there's a dune made of volcanic ash.

146
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily.

147
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
It's what's technically known as a "barchan," and the entire dune

148
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
walks across the desert in a westerly direction

149
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
at a speed of about 17 meters per year.

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns.

151
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
What happens is that the wind blows the sand

152
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
up the shallow slope on the other side, and then,

153
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge,

154
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
it cascades down on the inside of the crescent,

155
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.

156
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Steve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves,

157
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
more like a wave than a permanent thing.

158
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,820
He invites us, the reader, to "think of an experience

159
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
from your childhood -- something you remember clearly,

160
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
something you can see, feel, maybe even smell,

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
as if you were really there.

162
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,820
After all, you really were there at the time, weren't you?

163
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
How else would you remember it?

164
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
But here is the bombshell: You weren't there.

165
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there

166
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place

167
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
and momentarily comes together to be you.

168
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff

169
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
of which you are made.

170
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck,

171
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
read it again until it does, because it is important."

172
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,820
So "really" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence.

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
If a neutrino had a brain,

174
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors,

175
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space.

176
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors

177
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
which couldn't walk through rocks.

178
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
"Really," for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be

179
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
in order to assist its survival,

180
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
and because different species live in different worlds,

181
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,820
there will be a discomforting variety of "really"s.

182
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,820
What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world

183
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,820
but a model of the world, regulated and adjusted by sense data,

184
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world.

185
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.

186
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
A flying animal needs a different kind of model

187
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
from a walking, climbing or swimming animal.

188
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating

189
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks.

190
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
A mole's software for constructing models of its world

191
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
will be customized for underground use.

192
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,820
A water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all,

193
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
since it lives on the surface of the pond

194
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
in an Edwin Abbott flatland.

195
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears.

196
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate

197
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
through three dimensions catching insects

198
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820
must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird,

199
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
a day-flying bird like a swallow, needs to perform

200
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
the same kind of tasks.

201
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness

202
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
to input the current variables to its model,

203
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
while the swallow uses light, is incidental.

204
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue,

205
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,820
as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes --

206
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,820
perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on,

207
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
in the same way as swallows or, indeed, we, use those

208
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
perceived hues -- redness and blueness etc. --

209
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
to label long and short wavelengths of light.

210
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.

211
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
And the point is that the nature of the model is governed by

212
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,820
how it is to be used, rather than by the sensory modality involved.

213
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
J. B .S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals

214
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
whose world is dominated by smell.

215
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted:

216
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
caprylic acid and caproic acid.

217
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
The only difference, you see, is that one has an extra pair of

218
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
carbon atoms in the chain.

219
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids

220
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
in the order of their molecular weights by their smells,

221
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
just as a man could place a number of piano wires

222
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
in the order of their lengths by means of their notes.

223
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Now, there's another fatty acid, capric acid,

224
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
which is just like the other two,

225
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
except that it has two more carbon atoms.

226
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,820
A dog that had never met capric acid would, perhaps,

227
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble

228
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
imagining a trumpet, say, playing one note higher

229
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
than we've heard a trumpet play before.

230
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals

231
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
smell in color. And the argument would be

232
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
exactly the same as for the bats.

233
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Middle World -- the range of sizes and speeds

234
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with --

235
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,820
is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum

236
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
that we see as light of various colors.

237
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
We're blind to all frequencies outside that,

238
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
unless we use instruments to help us.

239
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Middle World is the narrow range of reality

240
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
which we judge to be normal, as opposed to the queerness

241
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
of the very small, the very large and the very fast.

242
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
We could make a similar scale of improbabilities;

243
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
nothing is totally impossible.

244
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable.

245
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,820
A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up

246
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway.

247
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
Because there are so many of them,

248
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
and because there's no agreement among them

249
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
in their preferred direction of movement, the marble,

250
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.

251
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move

252
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
the same way at the same time, and again and again.

253
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,820
In this case, the hand would move and we'd see it waving at us

254
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,820
in Middle World. The odds against it, of course, are so great

255
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
that if you set out writing zeros at the time of

256
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
the origin of the universe, you still would not have

257
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
written enough zeros to this day.

258
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle

259
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
very improbable events; we don't live long enough.

260
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,820
In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time,

261
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
that which seems impossible in Middle World

262
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
might turn out to be inevitable.

263
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
One way to think about that is by counting planets.

264
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
We don't know how many planets there are in the universe,

265
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,820
but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion.

266
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate

267
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
of life's improbability.

268
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Could make some sort of landmark points

269
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like

270
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.

271
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
If life has arisen only once on any --

272
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
if -- if life could -- I mean, life could originate once per planet,

273
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,820
could be extremely common, or it could originate once per star,

274
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,820
or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe,

275
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there

276
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince

277
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,820
and similar magical things like that.

278
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,820
If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe,

279
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,820
that planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it.

280
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it,

281
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life

282
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.

283
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that,

284
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.

285
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
And when I say quite common, it could still be so rare

286
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
that no one island of life ever encounters another,

287
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
which is a sad thought.

288
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
How shall we interpret "queerer than we can suppose?"

289
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Queerer than can in principle be supposed,

290
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
or just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations

291
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,820
of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World?

292
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Could we, by training and practice, emancipate ourselves

293
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive,

294
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
as well as mathematical, understanding of the very small

295
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,820
and the very large? I genuinely don't know the answer.

296
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand, say,

297
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
quantum theory, if we brought up children to play computer games,

298
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
beginning in early childhood, which had a sort of

299
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen,

300
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,820
a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics

301
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
were enlarged by the computer's make-believe,

302
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
so that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream.

303
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,820
And, similarly, a relativistic computer game in which

304
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,820
objects on the screen manifest the Lorenz Contraction, and so on,

305
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking --

306
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
get children into the way of thinking about it.

307
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World

308
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
to our perceptions of each other.

309
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind:

310
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are;

311
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
our hormones are the way they are.

312
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
We'd be different, our characters would be different,

313
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,820
if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different.

314
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
But we scientists are inconsistent. If we were consistent,

315
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,820
our response to a misbehaving person, like a child-murderer,

316
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
should be something like, this unit has a faulty component;

317
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
it needs repairing. That's not what we say.

318
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,820
What we say -- and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us,

319
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
which is probably me --

320
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
what we say is, "Vile monster, prison is too good for you."

321
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering

322
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,820
the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge,

323
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
which we see, of course, all over the world today.

324
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
In short, when we're thinking like academics,

325
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,820
we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines,

326
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
like computers or cars, but when we revert to being human

327
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,820
we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember,

328
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start

329
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,820
on gourmet night. (Laughter)

330
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
The reason we personify things like cars and computers

331
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,820
is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world

332
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
and moles live in an underground world

333
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland,

334
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,820
we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people --

335
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
a social version of Middle World.

336
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others

337
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.

338
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Treating people as machines

339
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,820
may be scientifically and philosophically accurate,

340
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
but it's a cumbersome waste of time

341
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.

342
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
The economically useful way to model a person

343
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
is to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent

344
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
with pleasures and pains, desires and intentions,

345
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
guilt, blame-worthiness.

346
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose

347
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans,

348
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,820
it's hardly surprising the same modeling software

349
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,820
often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities

350
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
for which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car

351
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:15,820
or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole. (Laughter)

352
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
If the universe is queerer than we can suppose,

353
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose

354
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
only what we needed to suppose in order to survive

355
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
in the Pleistocene of Africa?

356
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can

357
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,820
train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution?

358
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Or, finally, are there some things in the universe so queer

359
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,820
that no philosophy of beings, however godlike, could dream them?

360
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Thank you very much.
