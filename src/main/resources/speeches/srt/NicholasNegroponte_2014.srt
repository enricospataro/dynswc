1
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:14,931
(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: 
Can we switch to the video disc,

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,054
which is in play mode?

3
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:22,284
I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.

4
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:25,654
We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

5
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:30,028
for electronic books of the future.

6
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,642
(Music, crosstalk)

7
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,189
Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,

8
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:56,516
high-tech, high-touch, not having
to pick up your fingers to use them.

9
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:58,316
There is another way where computers

10
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,779
touch people: wearing, physically wearing.

11
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,487
Suddenly on September 11th,

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,124
the world got bigger.

13
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:16,109
NN: Thank you. (Applause)

14
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,168
Thank you.

15
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,276
When I was asked to do this,

16
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:24,472
I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks

17
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,182
that I had given,

18
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,980
chronologically.

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,254
The first one was actually two hours.

20
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,710
The second one was an hour,

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,259
and then they became half hours,

22
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,195
and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.

23
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,815
(Laughter)

24
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:42,983
Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,

25
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,390
and it was, to say the least,

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,763
for me, quite a shocking experience.

27
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:52,356
So what I'm going to do in my time

28
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:53,900
is try and share with you what happened

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,702
during the 30 years,

30
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,220
and then also make a prediction,

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,281
and then tell you a little bit

32
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:02,935
about what I'm doing next.

33
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:05,886
And I put on a slide

34
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:09,946
where TED 1 happened in my life.

35
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,860
And it's rather important

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,920
because I had done 15 years of research before it,

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,348
so I had a backlog, so it was easy.

38
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,108
It's not that I was Fidel Castro

39
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:21,941
and I could talk for two hours,

40
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,263
or Bucky Fuller.

41
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:25,178
I had 15 years of stuff,

42
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,650
and the Media Lab was about to start.

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,450
So that was easy.

44
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,114
But there are a couple of things

45
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,802
about that period

46
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:35,855
and about what happened that are

47
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,710
really quite important.

48
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,266
One is that

49
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,162
it was a period when computers

50
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,799
weren't yet for people.

51
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,944
And the other thing that sort of happened

52
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:52,015
during that time is that

53
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:55,397
we were considered sissy computer scientists.

54
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:56,960
We weren't considered the real thing.

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,959
So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,467
a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted

57
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,533
than it was at the time.

58
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,087
So I'm going to characterize the years

59
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,920
and I'm even going to go back

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,024
to some very early work of mine,

61
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,910
and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,097
very direct manipulation,

63
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,752
very influenced as I studied architecture

64
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,839
by the architect Moshe Safdie,

65
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,601
and you can see that we even built robotic things

66
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,357
that could build habitat-like structures.

67
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,044
And this for me was

68
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,960
not yet the Media Lab,

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,777
but was the beginning of what I'll call

70
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,296
sensory computing,

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,168
and I pick fingers

72
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:41,370
partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.

73
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,525
Papers were published

74
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:47,777
about how stupid it was to use fingers.

75
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,595
Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.

76
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,524
The other is your hand would occlude

77
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,965
what you wanted to see,

78
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,723
and the third, which was the winner,

79
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:59,379
was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,

80
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,705
and hence, fingers would never be

81
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,493
a device that you'd use.

82
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,542
And this was a device we built in the '70s,

83
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,413
which has never even been picked up.

84
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,854
It's not just touch sensitive,

85
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,032
it's pressure sensitive.

86
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,009
(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.

87
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,453
NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —

88
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,256
(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.

89
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:23,468
Create a large green circle there.

90
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,797
Man: Aw, shit.

91
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:29,227
NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,

92
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,035
so when you talked and you pointed

93
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,222
and you had, if you will,

94
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:35,781
multiple channels.

95
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:37,788
Entebbe happened.

96
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:41,335
1976, Air France was hijacked,

97
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,833
taken to Entebbe,

98
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,890
and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,

99
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,853
they did it partly because they had practiced

100
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:52,348
on a physical model of the airport,

101
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:53,504
because they had built the airport,

102
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,237
so they built a model in the desert,

103
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:56,953
and when they arrived at Entebbe,

104
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,873
they knew where to go because
they had actually been there.

105
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,125
The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,

106
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,900
if we could replicate that computationally,

107
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,089
and of course somebody like myself says yes.

108
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,115
Immediately, you get a contract,

109
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,600
Department of Defense,

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,288
and we built this truck and this rig.

111
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,808
We did sort of a simulation,

112
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,634
because you had video discs,

113
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,962
and again, this is '76.

114
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,659
And then many years later,

115
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,128
you get this truck,

116
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:28,086
and so you have Google Maps.

117
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,606
Still people thought,

118
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:33,626
no, that was not serious computer science,

119
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,685
and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,

120
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,092
who happened to be the president of MIT,

121
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,440
who did think it was computer science.

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,077
And one of the keys for anybody

123
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:46,461
who wants to start something in life:

124
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,730
Make sure your president is part of it.

125
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,750
So when I was doing the Media Lab,

126
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,907
it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.

127
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:58,092
If you were stopped for speeding

128
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,332
and the officer looked in the window

129
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,341
and saw who was in the passenger seat,

130
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,303
then, "Oh, continue on, sir."

131
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,988
And so we were able,

132
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:09,781
and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.

133
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,830
This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner

134
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,193
where the only thing that changed in the photograph

135
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,536
were the lips.

136
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:19,512
So when you oscillated that little piece

137
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,742
of lenticular sheet with his photograph,

138
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,755
it would be in lip sync

139
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,994
with zero bandwidth.

140
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:29,705
It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system

141
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,547
at the time.

142
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:35,528
So this was the Media Lab's —

143
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,221
this is what we said we'd do,

144
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,796
that the world of computers, publishing,

145
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:42,484
and so on would come together.

146
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,588
Again, not generally accepted,

147
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:49,560
but very much part of TED in the early days.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,766
And this is really where we were headed.

149
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,453
And that created the Media Lab.

150
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:58,704
One of the things about age

151
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:02,971
is that I can tell you with great confidence,

152
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,435
I've been to the future.

153
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,719
I've been there, actually, many times.

154
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,227
And the reason I say that is,

155
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:12,668
how many times in my life have I said,

156
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,445
"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"

157
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,493
and then 10 years comes.

158
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,251
And then you say, "Oh, in
five years, this will happen."

159
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,935
And then five years comes.

160
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:23,693
So I say this a little bit with having felt

161
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,030
that I'd been there a number of times,

162
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,670
and one of the things that is most quoted

163
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,819
that I've ever said

164
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,202
is that computing is not about computers,

165
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,758
and that didn't quite get enough traction,

166
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,277
and then it started to.

167
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:41,972
It started to because people caught on

168
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:45,110
that the medium wasn't the message.

169
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,755
And the reason I show this car

170
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:50,083
in actually a rather ugly slide

171
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,587
is just again to tell you the kind of story

172
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,415
that characterized a little bit of my life.

173
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,429
This is a student of mine

174
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,980
who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."

175
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,062
It was in the early days of GPS,

176
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,628
the car knew where it was,

177
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,543
and it would give audio instructions

178
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:09,970
to the driver, when to turn right, 
when to turn left and so on.

179
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,581
Turns out, there are a lot of things

180
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,616
in those instructions that back in that period

181
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,866
were pretty challenging,

182
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,094
like what does it mean, take the next right?

183
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,994
Well, if you're coming up on a street,

184
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:23,177
the next right's probably the one after,

185
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:24,408
and there are lots of issues,

186
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,653
and the student did a wonderful thesis,

187
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:31,500
and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.

188
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,440
It'll never be accepted.

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,750
The liabilities are too large.

190
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,141
There will be insurance issues.

191
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,785
Don't patent it."

192
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:39,878
So we didn't,

193
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:43,516
but it shows you how people, again, at times,

194
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:47,715
don't really look at what's happening.

195
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,610
Some work, and I'll just go
through these very quickly,

196
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,215
a lot of sensory stuff.

197
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,690
You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma

198
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,660
and tracking his body for playing

199
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,008
the cello or the hypercello.

200
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,985
These fellows literally walked 
around like that at the time.

201
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,620
It's now a little bit more discreet

202
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,661
and more commonplace.

203
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,930
And then there are at least three heroes

204
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,059
I want to quickly mention.

205
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,537
Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot

206
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:16,924
about common sense,

207
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,365
and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,

208
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:22,983
who was very important to Ricky Wurman

209
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:26,718
and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,

210
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,665
she said, the first thing she said was,

211
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,819
"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."

212
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,519
And nobody calls me Nicky

213
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,278
and nobody calls Richard Ricky,

214
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,680
so nobody knew who she was talking about.

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,077
And then, of course, Seymour Papert,

216
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:41,582
who is the person who said,

217
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,997
"You can't think about thinking

218
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,412
unless you think about thinking about something."

219
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:51,075
And that's actually — you can unpack that later.

220
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:55,181
It's a pretty profound statement.

221
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:56,921
I'm showing some slides

222
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,007
that were from TED 2,

223
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:02,749
a little silly as slides, perhaps.

224
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:08,090
Then I felt television really was about displays.

225
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:11,156
Again, now we're past TED 1,

226
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:14,182
but just around the time of TED 2,

227
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,331
and what I'd like to mention here is,

228
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,446
even though you could imagine

229
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:20,500
intelligence in the device,

230
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,932
I look today at some of the work

231
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:24,370
being done about the Internet of Things,

232
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,310
and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,

233
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,740
because what has happened is people take

234
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,238
the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,

235
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:35,027
or the door key onto your cell phone,

236
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,200
just taking it and bringing it to you,

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,921
and in fact that's actually what you don't want.

238
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,979
You want to put a chicken in the oven,

239
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,307
and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"

240
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,456
and it cooks the chicken.

241
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,222
"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,

242
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:49,056
and he likes it this way and that way."

243
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,109
So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,

244
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,818
we have started today

245
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,930
to move it back onto the cell phone

246
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,300
or closer to the user,

247
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,488
not a particularly enlightened view

248
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,229
of the Internet of Things.

249
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,693
Television, again, television what I said today,

250
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,315
that was back in 1990,

251
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,785
and the television of tomorrow

252
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:13,108
would look something like that.

253
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:16,652
Again, people, but they laughed cynically,

254
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:21,903
they didn't laugh with much appreciation.

255
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:24,553
Telecommunications in the 1990s,

256
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:30,253
George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram

257
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,682
the Negroponte switch.

258
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,688
I'm probably much less famous than George,

259
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:38,295
so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,

260
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,960
but the idea of things that came in the ground

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,675
would go in the air and stuff in the air

262
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,134
would go into the ground

263
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:46,019
has played itself out.

264
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,764
That is the original slide from that year,

265
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:54,139
and it has worked in lockstep obedience.

266
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,306
We started Wired magazine.

267
00:11:56,306 --> 00:12:00,042
Some people, I remember we shared

268
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,764
the reception desk periodically,

269
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,822
and some parent called up irate that his son

270
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:09,051
had given up Sports Illustrated

271
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,930
to subscribe for Wired,

272
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,127
and he said, "Are you some
porno magazine or something?"

273
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,711
and couldn't understand why his son

274
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:20,610
would be interested in Wired, at any rate.

275
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,214
I will go through this a little quicker.

276
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:26,713
This is my favorite, 1995,

277
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,750
back page of Newsweek magazine.

278
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,719
Okay. Read it. (Laughter)

279
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,620
["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."
—Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]

280
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,265
You must admit that gives you,

281
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,492
at least it gives me pleasure

282
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:41,250
when somebody says how dead wrong you are.

283
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,396
"Being Digital" came out.

284
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,037
For me, it gave me an opportunity

285
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,239
to be more in the trade press

286
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,510
and get this out to the public,

287
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,525
and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,

288
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,458
which if you haven't been to, visit,

289
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,477
because it's a beautiful piece of architecture

290
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,302
aside from being a wonderful place to work.

291
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:04,997
So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.

292
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,564
[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995]

293
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,056
We came to them.

294
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,048
I looked forward to it every year.

295
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,100
It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had

296
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,009
in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,

297
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,668
including myself.

298
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:20,060
And then something for me changed

299
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,529
pretty profoundly.

300
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,482
I became more involved with computers and learning

301
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,944
and influenced by Seymour,

302
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:30,559
but particularly looking at learning

303
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,469
as something that is best approximated

304
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:36,223
by computer programming.

305
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,237
When you write a computer program,

306
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:41,032
you've got to not just list things out

307
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,760
and sort of take an algorithm

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,636
and translate it into a set of instructions,

309
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:48,319
but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,

310
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,028
you've got to de-bug it.

311
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,018
You've got to go in, change it,

312
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,640
and then re-execute,

313
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,444
and you iterate,

314
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:58,351
and that iteration is really

315
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:01,254
a very, very good approximation of learning.

316
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:04,921
So that led to my own work with Seymour

317
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,279
in places like Cambodia

318
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,183
and the starting of One Laptop per Child.

319
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,997
Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,

320
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,758
so I'll go through it very fast,

321
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:18,683
but it did give us the chance

322
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:22,189
to do something at a relatively large scale

323
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:26,182
in the area of learning, development and computing.

324
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,999
Very few people know that One Laptop per Child

325
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,634
was a $1 billion project,

326
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:34,281
and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,

327
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,427
but even more important, the World Bank

328
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:39,542
contributed zero, USAID zero.

329
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:43,697
It was mostly the countries
using their own treasuries,

330
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,300
which is very interesting,

331
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,656
at least to me it was very interesting

332
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:49,800
in terms of what I plan to do next.

333
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,825
So these are the various places it happened.

334
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,727
I then tried an experiment,

335
00:14:55,727 --> 00:15:00,008
and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.

336
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:02,650
And here's the experiment.

337
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,281
The experiment is,

338
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,061
can learning happen where there are no schools.

339
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,591
And we dropped off tablets

340
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,834
with no instructions

341
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,107
and let the children figure it out.

342
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:19,754
And in a short period of time,

343
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,852
they not only

344
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,924
turned them on and were using 50 apps per child

345
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,026
within five days,

346
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,960
they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,

347
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,853
but they hacked Android within six months.

348
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:37,371
And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.

349
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,930
This is perhaps the best picture I have.

350
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,081
The kid on your right

351
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,556
has sort of nominated himself as teacher.

352
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:49,076
Look at the kid on the left, and so on.

353
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:52,226
There are no adults involved in this at all.

354
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,650
So I said, well can we do this

355
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,247
at a larger scale?

356
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,728
And what is it that's missing?

357
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,997
The kids are giving a press conference at this point,

358
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:02,682
and sort of writing in the dirt.

359
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:06,127
And the answer is, what is missing?

360
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:08,663
And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,

361
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,191
because I'm running out of time,

362
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:14,159
and here's the question, is what's going to happen?

363
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,646
I think the challenge

364
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:18,274
is to connect the last billion people,

365
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,925
and connecting the last billion

366
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:24,322
is very different than connecting the next billion,

367
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:25,716
and the reason it's different

368
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,580
is that the next billion

369
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,530
are sort of low-hanging fruit,

370
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,897
but the last billion are rural.

371
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:36,649
Being rural and being poor

372
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:37,781
are very different.

373
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,414
Poverty tends to be created by our society,

374
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:46,864
and the people in that community are not poor

375
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:48,773
in the same way at all.

376
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,178
They may be primitive,

377
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:54,222
but the way to approach it and to connect them,

378
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,753
the history of One Laptop per Child,

379
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:00,409
and the experiment in Ethiopia,

380
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,684
lead me to believe that we can in fact

381
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:06,485
do this in a very short period of time.

382
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,326
And so my plan,

383
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,560
and unfortunately I haven't been able

384
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,428
to get my partners at this point

385
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,719
to let me announce them,

386
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:19,626
but is to do this with a stationary satellite.

387
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:22,085
There are many reasons

388
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:26,600
that stationary satellites aren't the best things,

389
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,537
but there are a lot of reasons why they are,

390
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,632
and for two billion dollars,

391
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:36,316
you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,

392
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,977
but the reason I picked two,

393
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:42,360
and I will leave this as my last slide,

394
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,144
is two billion dollars

395
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,063
is what we were spending

396
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:49,156
in Afghanistan

397
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,068
every week.

398
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:54,375
So surely if we can connect

399
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,075
Africa and the last billion people

400
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,629
for numbers like that,

401
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,942
we should be doing it.

402
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:02,239
Thank you very much.

403
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,768
(Applause)

404
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:10,098
Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.

405
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,128
NN: You're going to give me extra time?

406
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:14,490
CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.

407
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,355
You gamed it beautifully.

408
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,985
Nicholas, what is your prediction?

409
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:21,011
(Laughter)

410
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,447
NN: Thank you for asking.

411
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:26,220
I'll tell you what my prediction is,

412
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,920
and my prediction, and this is a prediction,

413
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,582
because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.

414
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:36,310
But one of the things about learning how to read,

415
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,159
we have been doing a lot of consuming

416
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,444
of information going through our eyes,

417
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:44,520
and so that may be a very inefficient channel.

418
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,605
So my prediction is that we are 
going to ingest information

419
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:52,802
You're going to swallow a pill and know English.

420
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:55,494
You're going to swallow a
pill and know Shakespeare.

421
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:58,103
And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.

422
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,960
So once it's in your bloodstream,

423
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,178
it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,

424
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,360
and when it knows that it's in the brain

425
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,682
in the different pieces,

426
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,307
it deposits it in the right places.

427
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,639
So it's ingesting.

428
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,159
CA: Have you been hanging out
with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?

429
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,372
NN: No, but I've been hanging
around with Ed Boyden

430
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,217
and hanging around with one of the speakers

431
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,030
who is here, Hugh Herr,

432
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,927
and there are a number of people.

433
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,324
This isn't quite as far-fetched,

434
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:25,269
so 30 years from now.

435
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,011
CA: We will check it out.

436
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:29,313
We're going to be back and we're going
to play this clip 30 years from now,

437
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:32,344
and then all eat the red pill.

438
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,529
Well thank you for that.

439
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,973
Nicholas Negroponte.

440
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,321
NN: Thank you.

441
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,135
(Applause)
