1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,386
Intelligence -- what is it?

2
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,677
If we take a look back at the history

3
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:21,301
of how intelligence has been viewed,

4
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:24,919
one seminal example has been

5
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:28,396
Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that

6
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,507
"the question of whether a machine can think

7
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:32,817
is about as interesting

8
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,788
as the question of whether a submarine

9
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,578
can swim."

10
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:41,422
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,

11
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:43,476
intended it as a criticism

12
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,476
of the early pioneers of computer science,

13
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:48,223
like Alan Turing.

14
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:50,722
However, if you take a look back

15
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:52,687
and think about what have been

16
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,683
the most empowering innovations

17
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,562
that enabled us to build

18
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:58,796
artificial machines that swim

19
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:01,369
and artificial machines that [fly],

20
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,916
you find that it was only through understanding

21
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,524
the underlying physical mechanisms

22
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:10,303
of swimming and flight

23
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,475
that we were able to build these machines.

24
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,731
And so, several years ago,

25
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,980
I undertook a program to try to understand

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,614
the fundamental physical mechanisms

27
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,382
underlying intelligence.

28
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:26,242
Let's take a step back.

29
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:29,391
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.

30
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,245
Pretend that you're an alien race

31
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:35,286
that doesn't know anything about Earth biology

32
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:38,402
or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,

33
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:40,594
but you have amazing telescopes

34
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,956
and you're able to watch the Earth,

35
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:45,288
and you have amazingly long lives,

36
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,787
so you're able to watch the Earth

37
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:50,229
over millions, even billions of years.

38
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,244
And you observe a really strange effect.

39
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:57,556
You observe that, over the course of the millennia,

40
00:01:57,556 --> 00:02:01,841
Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids

41
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,928
up until a point,

42
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:05,459
and that at some point,

43
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,651
corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,

44
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,367
asteroids that are on

45
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,298
a collision course with the Earth

46
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,273
that otherwise would have collided

47
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,688
mysteriously get deflected

48
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:20,760
or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,843
Now of course, as earthlings,

50
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,387
we know the reason would be

51
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,143
that we're trying to save ourselves.

52
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:29,223
We're trying to prevent an impact.

53
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,934
But if you're an alien race

54
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,080
who doesn't know any of this,

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,594
doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,

56
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,322
you'd be forced to put together

57
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,240
a physical theory that explains how,

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,778
up until a certain point in time,

59
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:46,227
asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet

60
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:49,458
mysteriously stop doing that.

61
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,662
And so I claim that this is the same question

62
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:57,660
as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.

63
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,542
So in this program that I
undertook several years ago,

64
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,307
I looked at a variety of different threads

65
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:07,469
across science, across a variety of disciplines,

66
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,361
that were pointing, I think,

67
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,909
towards a single, underlying mechanism

68
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,490
for intelligence.

69
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,036
In cosmology, for example,

70
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,783
there have been a variety of
different threads of evidence

71
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:22,190
that our universe appears to be finely tuned

72
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,343
for the development of intelligence,

73
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:26,732
and, in particular, for the development

74
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,618
of universal states

75
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:32,716
that maximize the diversity of possible futures.

76
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,060
In game play, for example, in Go --

77
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,085
everyone remembers in 1997

78
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,036
when IBM's Deep Blue beat 
Garry Kasparov at chess --

79
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,559
fewer people are aware

80
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,577
that in the past 10 years or so,

81
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:46,775
the game of Go,

82
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,731
arguably a much more challenging game

83
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,156
because it has a much higher branching factor,

84
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,858
has also started to succumb

85
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,723
to computer game players

86
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,296
for the same reason:

87
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,096
the best techniques right now
for computers playing Go

88
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,792
are techniques that try to maximize future options

89
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,806
during game play.

90
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:08,387
Finally, in robotic motion planning,

91
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,569
there have been a variety of recent techniques

92
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,471
that have tried to take advantage

93
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:15,617
of abilities of robots to maximize

94
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,123
future freedom of action

95
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,220
in order to accomplish complex tasks.

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,575
And so, taking all of these different threads

97
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,197
and putting them together,

98
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,837
I asked, starting several years ago,

99
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:29,687
is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence

100
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,360
that we can factor out

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,134
of all of these different threads?

102
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:37,727
Is there a single equation for intelligence?

103
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:41,098
And the answer, I believe, is yes.
["F = T ∇ Sτ"]

104
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,011
What you're seeing is probably

105
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:46,305
the closest equivalent to an E = mc²

106
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:49,135
for intelligence that I've seen.

107
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,837
So what you're seeing here

108
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,506
is a statement of correspondence

109
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:57,941
that intelligence is a force, F,

110
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,591
that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,966
It acts to maximize future freedom of action,

112
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,594
or keep options open,

113
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,819
with some strength T,

114
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,596
with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,

115
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,146
up to some future time horizon, tau.

116
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:19,355
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.

117
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:22,410
Intelligence tries to maximize
future freedom of action

118
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,083
and keep options open.

119
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,516
And so, given this one equation,

120
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,048
it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?

121
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,399
How predictive is it?

122
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,534
Does it predict human-level intelligence?

123
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,352
Does it predict artificial intelligence?

124
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,394
So I'm going to show you now a video

125
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:41,814
that will, I think, demonstrate

126
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:44,102
some of the amazing applications

127
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:46,421
of just this single equation.

128
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,400
(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,447
has suggested that universes that produce

130
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:53,928
more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes

131
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:56,406
should tend to have more favorable conditions

132
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:59,422
for the existence of intelligent
beings such as ourselves.

133
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,996
But what if that tentative cosmological connection

134
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,839
between entropy and intelligence

135
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,610
hints at a deeper relationship?

136
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,174
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate

137
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:10,018
with the production of long-term entropy,

138
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:12,336
but actually emerges directly from it?

139
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,742
To find out, we developed a software engine

140
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,245
called Entropica, designed to maximize

141
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,013
the production of long-term entropy

142
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,589
of any system that it finds itself in.

143
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,744
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass

144
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:27,200
multiple animal intelligence
tests, play human games,

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,346
and even earn money trading stocks,

146
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,457
all without being instructed to do so.

147
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,975
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.

148
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:37,180
Just like a human standing
upright without falling over,

149
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,410
here we see Entropica

150
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,295
automatically balancing a pole using a cart.

151
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,307
This behavior is remarkable in part

152
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:45,638
because we never gave Entropica a goal.

153
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,795
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.

154
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,927
This balancing ability will have appliactions

155
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,324
for humanoid robotics

156
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,839
and human assistive technologies.

157
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,840
Just as some animals can use objects

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,282
in their environments as tools

159
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,269
to reach into narrow spaces,

160
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,151
here we see that Entropica,

161
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,989
again on its own initiative,

162
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,899
was able to move a large
disk representing an animal

163
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,244
around so as to cause a small disk,

164
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:12,015
representing a tool, to reach into a confined space

165
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,552
holding a third disk

166
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:16,524
and release the third disk
from its initially fixed position.

167
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:18,713
This tool use ability will have applications

168
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:21,072
for smart manufacturing and agriculture.

169
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,016
In addition, just as some other animals

170
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,712
are able to cooperate by pulling
opposite ends of a rope

171
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,765
at the same time to release food,

172
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,060
here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish

173
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,048
a model version of that task.

174
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,570
This cooperative ability has interesting implications

175
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,005
for economic planning and a variety of other fields.

176
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,076
Entropica is broadly applicable

177
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,019
to a variety of domains.

178
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,461
For example, here we see it successfully

179
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:47,020
playing a game of pong against itself,

180
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,363
illustrating its potential for gaming.

181
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,282
Here we see Entropica orchestrating

182
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:53,121
new connections on a social network

183
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,881
where friends are constantly falling out of touch

184
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,737
and successfully keeping
the network well connected.

185
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,035
This same network orchestration ability

186
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:03,363
also has applications in health care,

187
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:06,595
energy, and intelligence.

188
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,680
Here we see Entropica directing the paths

189
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,166
of a fleet of ships,

190
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,341
successfully discovering and
utilizing the Panama Canal

191
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,799
to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic

192
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,328
to the Pacific.

193
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,055
By the same token, Entropica

194
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:20,675
is broadly applicable to problems

195
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:25,977
in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.

196
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:28,023
Finally, here we see Entropica

197
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:30,746
spontaneously discovering and executing

198
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,813
a buy-low, sell-high strategy

199
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,991
on a simulated range traded stock,

200
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:37,322
successfully growing assets under management

201
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:38,746
exponentially.

202
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:40,054
This risk management ability

203
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,541
will have broad applications in finance

204
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,869
and insurance.

205
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,960
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen

206
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,352
is that a variety of signature human intelligent

207
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:54,109
cognitive behaviors

208
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:56,940
such as tool use and walking upright

209
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,969
and social cooperation

210
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,941
all follow from a single equation,

211
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,873
which drives a system

212
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:07,784
to maximize its future freedom of action.

213
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:10,791
Now, there's a profound irony here.

214
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,815
Going back to the beginning

215
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:16,088
of the usage of the term robot,

216
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,991
the play "RUR,"

217
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,226
there was always a concept

218
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,452
that if we developed machine intelligence,

219
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,479
there would be a cybernetic revolt.

220
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:31,030
The machines would rise up against us.

221
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,349
One major consequence of this work

222
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,118
is that maybe all of these decades,

223
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,094
we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt

224
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,105
in reverse.

225
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:44,384
It's not that machines first become intelligent

226
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,399
and then megalomaniacal

227
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,623
and try to take over the world.

228
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,057
It's quite the opposite,

229
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,963
that the urge to take control

230
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:55,224
of all possible futures

231
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:57,342
is a more fundamental principle

232
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,705
than that of intelligence,

233
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:02,405
that general intelligence may in fact emerge

234
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,964
directly from this sort of control-grabbing,

235
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:10,149
rather than vice versa.

236
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,918
Another important consequence is goal seeking.

237
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:18,278
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals

238
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:19,898
follow from this sort of framework?

239
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:22,926
And the answer is, the ability to seek goals

240
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,808
will follow directly from this

241
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,642
in the following sense:

242
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,507
just like you would travel through a tunnel,

243
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:32,012
a bottleneck in your future path space,

244
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,883
in order to achieve many other

245
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,904
diverse objectives later on,

246
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:38,276
or just like you would invest

247
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:40,063
in a financial security,

248
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,300
reducing your short-term liquidity

249
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,700
in order to increase your wealth over the long term,

250
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,037
goal seeking emerges directly

251
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,766
from a long-term drive

252
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,803
to increase future freedom of action.

253
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:56,331
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,

254
00:10:56,331 --> 00:11:00,003
once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed

255
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,896
and you could pass only a single concept

256
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,267
on to our descendants

257
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,574
to help them rebuild civilization,

258
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:07,260
that concept should be

259
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,112
that all matter around us

260
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:11,435
is made out of tiny elements

261
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,943
that attract each other when they're far apart

262
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:17,273
but repel each other when they're close together.

263
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:19,054
My equivalent of that statement

264
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,322
to pass on to descendants

265
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:23,034
to help them build artificial intelligences

266
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,983
or to help them understand human intelligence,

267
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,250
is the following:

268
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,303
Intelligence should be viewed

269
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:30,716
as a physical process

270
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,681
that tries to maximize future freedom of action

271
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,297
and avoid constraints in its own future.

272
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,655
Thank you very much.

273
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:42,655
(Applause)
