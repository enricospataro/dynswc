1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,820
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,820
while writing an article for Italian Wired.

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,820
but I'd already finished editing the piece,

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
and I realized that I had never once in my life

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,820
looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Let me read you the entry.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:45,820
"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,820
stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:02,820
run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,820
senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820
cracked-up, counted-out;

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,820
see also hurt, useless and weak.

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable."

15
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
it was so ludicrous,

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,820
but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
and I had to stop and collect myself

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:45,820
from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.

20
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,820
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,

23
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
when I would have been starting primary school

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,820
and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
and as related to the other kids and the world around me.

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,820
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.

27
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,820
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
that perceived someone like me

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,820
to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,

30
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,820
when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
my life has procured.

32
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,820
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,820
expecting to find a revision worth noting.

34
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Here's the updated version of this entry.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Unfortunately, it's not much better.

36
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:

37
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
"whole" and "wholesome."

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
So, it's not just about the words.

39
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,820
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world

42
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
and how we view other people.

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,

44
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,820
believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,

45
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,820
because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.

46
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,820
So, what reality do we want to call into existence:

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,820
a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?

48
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,820
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,

49
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,820
we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.

50
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,820
at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.

53
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,

54
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
an Italian American, whose name, apparently,

55
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,

56
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
so he went by Dr. P.

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,820
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties

58
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,820
and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.

59
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,

60
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,820
with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,820
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises

62
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,

63
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,820
you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,

64
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
and I hated these bands more than anything --

65
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,820
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,820
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
unsuccessfully, of course.

69
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,820
And, one day, he came in to my session --

70
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,820
exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,820
and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,

72
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,820
I think you're going to break one of those bands.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."

74
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part

75
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do

76
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,820
before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,

77
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:42,820
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,820
into a new and promising experience for me.

79
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision

80
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,820
and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl

81
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
shaped my own view of myself

82
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,820
as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.

83
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,820
This is an example of how adults in positions of power

84
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,820
can ignite the power of a child.

85
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,820
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,

86
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,820
our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,

87
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,820
the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.

88
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,

89
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
many of which have been brought about by technology.

90
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Certainly, from a medical standpoint,

91
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,820
my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,

92
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,820
titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies

93
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,

94
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,820
and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --

95
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
not to mention social networking platforms

96
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,820
allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,

97
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,820
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.

98
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,820
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now

99
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
what has always been a truth:

100
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:23,820
that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,

101
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,820
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.

102
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,

103
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,820
because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,820
and I'm going to make an admission:

105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
This phrase never sat right with me,

106
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,820
and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,

107
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
and I think I'm starting to figure out why.

108
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"

109
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,820
is the idea that success, or happiness,

110
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,820
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience

111
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,820
unscathed or unmarked by the experience,

112
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,820
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability

113
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,820
to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,

114
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
or what other people perceive as my disability.

115
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,820
But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,

116
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,820
whether physically, emotionally or both.

117
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.

118
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around

119
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,820
in order to resume living our life.

120
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
It's part of our life.

121
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.

122
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,

123
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
but it's always with me.

124
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,820
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.

125
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
There is adversity and challenge in life,

126
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,820
and it's all very real and relative to every single person,

127
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,

128
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,820
but how you're going to meet it.

129
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,820
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,

130
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
but preparing them to meet it well.

131
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
And we do a disservice to our kids

132
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,820
when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,820
There's an important difference and distinction

134
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,820
between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee

135
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,820
and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.

136
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront

137
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,820
is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.

138
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
In our desire to protect those we care about

139
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,820
by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,

140
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,

141
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,820
we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall

142
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,820
that will actually disable someone.

143
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you

144
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual

145
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
than the pathology itself.

146
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,820
By not treating the wholeness of a person,

147
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
by not acknowledging their potency,

148
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,820
we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.

149
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,820
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.

150
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
So we need to see through the pathology

151
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,820
and into the range of human capability.

152
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,820
And, most importantly, there's a partnership

153
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
between those perceived deficiencies

154
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
and our greatest creative ability.

155
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,820
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times

156
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,820
as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,

157
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,820
but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.

158
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is

159
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,820
not so much overcoming adversity

160
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,820
as it is opening ourselves up to it,

161
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
embracing it,

162
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
grappling with it,

163
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
to use a wrestling term,

164
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,820
maybe even dancing with it.

165
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,820
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,

166
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
we're less burdened by the presence of it.

167
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,

168
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,820
and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,

169
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,820
that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.

170
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,820
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,

171
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
nor is it the most intelligent that survives;

172
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,820
it is the one that is most adaptable to change.

173
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Conflict is the genesis of creation.

174
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that

175
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,820
the human ability to survive and flourish

176
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,820
is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict

177
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
into transformation.

178
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,820
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.

179
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,820
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.

180
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Maybe that's what adversity gives us:

181
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,820
a sense of self, a sense of our own power.

182
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
So, we can give ourselves a gift.

183
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,820
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.

184
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Maybe we can see it as change.

185
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.

186
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves

187
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
is this idea of normalcy.

188
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Now, who's normal?

189
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
There's no normal.

190
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,820
There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,

191
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?

192
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
(Laughter)

193
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
I don't think so.

194
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,820
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy

195
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,820
to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --

196
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,820
we can release the power of so many more children,

197
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:56,820
and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.

198
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Anthropologists tell us that the one thing

199
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
we as humans have always required of our community members

200
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
is to be of use, to be able to contribute.

201
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,820
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,

202
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:16,820
carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,

203
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,820
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people

204
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
proved of value to the community.

205
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,820
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;

206
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
they were seen as rare and valuable.

207
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up

208
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,820
in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,

209
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.

210
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
It was summertime: I had shorts on.

211
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,820
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."

212
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,820
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.

213
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,820
And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."

214
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.

215
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."

216
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
(Laughter)

217
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Oh, that guy.

218
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
And, but of course, actually, it did click.

219
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
This man was Dr. Kean,

220
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,

221
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,820
because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.

222
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,

223
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,820
so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.

224
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
And, because I was born without the fibula bones,

225
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,

226
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,820
he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.

227
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,820
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents

228
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
that you would never walk,

229
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,820
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have

230
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
or any kind of life of independence,

231
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
and you've been making liar out of me ever since."

232
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
(Laughter)

233
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,820
(Applause)

234
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved

235
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,

236
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
whether winning a second grade spelling bee,

237
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,

238
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,820
winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,

239
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,820
and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,

240
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,820
med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.

241
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,820
And he called this part of the course the X Factor,

242
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
the potential of the human will.

243
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,820
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be

244
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,820
as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.

245
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,

246
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:58,820
he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,

247
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,820
and even if given a modicum of support,

248
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,820
if left to their own devices, a child will achieve."

249
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,820
See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.

250
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition

251
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
and what someone might do with it.

252
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,

253
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,

254
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,

255
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.

256
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,820
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.

257
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,820
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.

258
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,820
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,

259
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,820
not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.

260
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
And perhaps this shift in me has happened

261
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,820
because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me

262
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,820
than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.

263
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
See, all you really need is one person

264
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,820
to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.

265
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,820
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --

266
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that

267
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,

268
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,820
you are educating them in the best sense.

269
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,820
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.

270
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,820
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"

271
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
comes from the root word "educe."

272
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,820
It means "to bring forth what is within,

273
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
to bring out potential."

274
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,820
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?

275
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,

276
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,820
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.

277
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.

278
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,820
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.

279
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,820
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.

280
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Well, they took, over a three-month period,

281
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
D-level students, gave them A's,

282
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,

283
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
and at the end of this three-month period,

284
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
they were performing at A-level.

285
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,820
And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,

286
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,820
is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."

287
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.

288
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.

289
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:51,820
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.

290
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.

291
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,820
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"

292
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,820
And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.

293
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:12,820
So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,

294
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,820
a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,

295
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
it doesn't see beauty,

296
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,820
it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity

297
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
and our innate ability to imagine.

298
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,820
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,

299
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,820
to see beauty in themselves and others,

300
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,820
to be curious and imaginative,

301
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,820
then we are truly using our power well.

302
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,820
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities

303
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
and new ways of being.

304
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
I'd like to leave you with a poem

305
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,820
by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz

306
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,

307
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,820
and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":

308
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,820
"Every child has known God,

309
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
not the God of names,

310
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,820
not the God of don'ts,

311
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,820
but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,

312
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,820
saying, 'Come dance with me.

313
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"

314
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Thank you.

315
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:46,820
(Applause)
