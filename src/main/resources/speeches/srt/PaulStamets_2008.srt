1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
We all know the Earth is in trouble.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
We have now entered in the 6X,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
the sixth major extinction on this planet.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,820
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,820
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
I think that vote is occurring right now.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,820
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
The mycelium infuses all landscapes,

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,820
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,820
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,820
of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
so the mycelium is the mother

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I'm in love with the old-growth forest,

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,820
and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.

27
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
When I mention mushrooms to somebody,

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,820
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
We call it mycophobia,

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Day 21, day 23, day 25.

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,820
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,820
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,820
published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,820
a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
We share in common the same pathogens.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,820
and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.

43
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
After they sporulate, they do rot.

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
that occur on rotting mushrooms

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
are essential for the health of the forest.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
They give rise to the trees,

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,820
they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.

51
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
And the spores are germinating,

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and the mycelium forms and goes underground.

53
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,820
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.

55
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,820
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.

56
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
And notice that as the mycelium grows,

57
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
it conquers territory and then it begins the net.

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
I have thousands of electron micrographs,

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
and when I'm staring at the mycelium,

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,820
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,820
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,820
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.

66
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,820
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,

67
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
These are little wells.

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.

70
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,820
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
but sets up a microbial universe

72
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,820
that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.

73
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
I first proposed, in the early 1990s,

74
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.

75
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,820
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,820
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,

77
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
because of the nodes of crossing --

78
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,820
there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.

80
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
The mycelium is sentient.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
It knows that you are there.

82
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
When you walk across landscapes,

83
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,820
it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.

84
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,820
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet

85
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
is an inevitable consequence

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,820
of a previously proven, biologically successful model.

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,820
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,

88
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,820
and we now, being the top organism on this planet,

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,820
are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.

90
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
I believe matter begets life;

92
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;

93
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,820
strings become chains; chains network.

94
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,820
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.

95
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,

97
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
and plants followed several hundred million years later.

98
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,820
How is that possible?

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,

100
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
and many other acids and enzymes,

101
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals

102
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
and forming calcium oxalates.

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.

105
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
So, fungi and mycelium

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,820
sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.

107
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
And all sorts of other oxalates

108
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals

109
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.

110
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
This was first discovered in 1859.

111
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.

112
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.

113
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,820
420 million years ago, this organism existed.

114
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
It was called Prototaxites.

115
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.

116
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,820
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.

117
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,

118
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
published an article in the Journal of Geology

119
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,820
this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,

120
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
a giant mushroom.

121
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.

122
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
All across most land masses.

123
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
And these existed for tens of millions of years.

124
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --

125
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --

126
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
we had an asteroid impact.

127
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
The Earth was struck by an asteroid,

128
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,820
a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.

129
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.

130
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,

131
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
because fungi do not need light.

132
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
More recently, at Einstein University,

133
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,820
they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,

134
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
much like plants use light.

135
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,820
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,

136
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
I think, is a forgone conclusion,

137
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,820
at least in my own mind.

138
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.

139
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:

140
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.

141
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,820
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.

142
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,820
How is it that this organism can be so large,

143
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
and yet be one cell wall thick,

144
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?

145
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,820
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --

146
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.

147
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
We were involved with several experiments.

148
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I'm going to show you six, if I can,

149
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
solutions for helping to save the world.

150
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.

151
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,820
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:

152
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,820
one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;

153
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,820
one pile was treated with bacteria;

154
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.

155
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
The mycelium absorbs the oil.

156
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
The mycelium is producing enzymes --

157
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,820
peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.

158
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.

159
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,

160
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
and then, when we returned six weeks later,

161
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
all the tarps were removed,

162
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.

163
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
We came back to our pile, it was covered

164
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,

165
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,820
and the color changed to a light form.

166
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,820
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons

167
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.

168
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.

169
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
They're very large.

170
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.

171
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,820
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.

172
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
They sporulated, the spores attract insects,

173
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.

174
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Birds then came, bringing in seeds,

175
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
and our pile became an oasis of life.

176
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,

177
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,820
and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --

178
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,820
went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.

179
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
The last image we don't have.

180
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
The entire pile was a green berm of life.

181
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
These are gateway species,

182
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,820
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.

183
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,820
So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --

184
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,

185
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream

186
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,

187
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
or a factory with chemical toxins,

188
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
and it leads to habitat restoration.

189
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,

190
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.

191
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And I'll show you a graph here.

192
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.

193
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,

194
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.

195
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,820
In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,820
reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.

197
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
Think of the implications.

198
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,820
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --

199
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.

200
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,820
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.

201
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
This is my wife Dusty,

202
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.

203
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest

204
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.

205
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
as a treatment against consumption.

206
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,

207
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,820
northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.

208
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
May not seem that large --

209
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
let's get closer.

210
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
This is extremely rare fungus.

211
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --

212
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,820
we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.

213
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
We found one sample to be able to get into culture.

214
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,820
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest

215
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
I think is absolutely critical for human health.

216
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,820
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.

217
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,

218
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.

219
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
And a few years ago,

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
we received these results.

221
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,820
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

222
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
that were highly active against poxviruses.

223
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert

224
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds

225
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.

226
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
10 or greater are considered to be very active.

227
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.

228
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
There's a vetted press release that you can read --

229
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
it's vetted by DOD --

230
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."

231
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.

232
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,820
So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.

233
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.

234
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

235
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
highly active against flu viruses.

236
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Here's the selectivity index numbers --

237
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,

238
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
compared to the ribavirin controls,

239
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,820
we have an extraordinarily high activity.

240
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
And we're using a natural extract

241
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.

242
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --

243
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
as well as flu B viruses.

244
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
So then we tried a blend,

245
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,820
and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,

246
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820
and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.

247
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
(Applause)

248
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I then think that we can make the argument

249
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
that we should save the old-growth forest

250
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,820
as a matter of national defense.

251
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
(Applause)

252
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,820
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --

253
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
fungi that kill insects.

254
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.

255
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies

256
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
with metarhizium species of a group of fungi

257
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.

258
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
I did something that nobody else had done.

259
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.

260
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
These are spores -- this is in their spores.

261
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
I was able to morph the culture

262
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
into a non-sporulating form.

263
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars

264
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.

265
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
But the insects aren't stupid,

266
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and they would avoid the spores when they came close,

267
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.

268
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,

269
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants

270
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
were making debris fields, every day,

271
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,820
in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,

272
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
because there's no spores.

273
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
They gave it to the queen.

274
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.

275
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,820
And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --

276
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
the mycelium is consumed by the ants,

277
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.

278
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
(Laughter)

279
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.

280
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,820
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.

281
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,820
So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.

282
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
And so my house came down, I received my first patent

283
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.

284
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,

285
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
we can steer insects to different directions.

286
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
This has huge implications.

287
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.

288
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.

289
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
It covers over 200,000 species.

290
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
This is the most disruptive technology --

291
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --

292
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
that they have ever witnessed.

293
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.

294
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,820
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,

295
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,

296
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
prior to sporulation, attract the very insects

297
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
that are otherwise repelled by those spores.

298
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,820
And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.

299
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,820
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --

300
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
you add soil, you add water,

301
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,820
you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,

302
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
like of the Agarikon mushroom.

303
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.

304
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
And then you put tree seeds in here,

305
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
and then you end up growing -- potentially --

306
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.

307
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I want to reinvent the delivery system,

308
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
and the use of cardboard around the world,

309
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
so they become ecological footprints.

310
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,

311
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
you could make it interactive, zip code specific --

312
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
where people could join together,

313
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
and through satellite imaging systems,

314
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,

315
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered

316
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,820
by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.

317
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,

318
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --

319
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
corns, beans and squash and onions.

320
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --

321
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
and I ended up growing a seed garden.

322
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Then you harvest the seeds --

323
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,820
and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --

324
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
and then you're harvesting the seed garden.

325
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.

326
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,820
I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.

327
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Now, three corncobs, no other grain --

328
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
lots of mushrooms begin to form.

329
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,

330
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
and so this population will be shut down.

331
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
But watch what happens here.

332
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
The mushrooms then are harvested,

333
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,820
but very importantly,

334
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,820
the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.

335
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,820
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?

336
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
And we came up with Econol.

337
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --

338
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,820
and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.

339
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,820
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,

340
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent

341
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
about the generation of fuels.

342
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.

343
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,820
These are a species that we need to join with.

344
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,820
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.

345
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Thank you very much.

346
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
(Applause)
